Our prinicipal says that we have to participate in one activity. Therefore, students can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, or serve for the student council. I agree that kids should do something besides playing games and sleeping. Kids should have fun with there activitys in school, maybe most of the day should be learning and some of it can be having fun. I also disagree because some kids dont like sports, or working on the yearbook, and some kids dont want to serve for the student council. Alot of kids are diffrent so they should have more options, like reading books, painting, or even designing clothes. Also it depends on what grade level the students are in because all of this is preparing them for when they are adults. I play sports and that keeps me occupied by keeping my mind off of other things. Most kids should not be forced to do something they dont like, they should do something that they like. Then the students are failing that class because they dont like it and that is not good. So we should add more options to shool activitys for the students can do better. Please help the students have a great time at school, it shouldnt be a cage it should be a little free. School is supposed to be fun so help the students out parent and teachers.
