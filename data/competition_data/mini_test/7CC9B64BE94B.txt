Are driverless cars neccesary? in my opionon driverless cars are not neccesary for one i belive driverless cars are more for amusment than anything else. for example in the artice"telivision and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves" so companies are going through all this trouble to make a driverless care that will amuse peaple.

secondly i dont think driverless cares are very safe driverless cars are not driverless yet they are more of an asistant for the driver. the driver can not pay attention and that could lead to acdidents.

finally driverles cars are technolgy and technology can always have glitches and i dont know about you but i would not like my life to depend on a machine that can have glitches if a driverless car were ever to harm a driver the driver could sue the comapny and that would be a loss for the companies so the companies would be taking a risk so in conclusion i dont think driverless cars should be something that peaple can go out and buy.
