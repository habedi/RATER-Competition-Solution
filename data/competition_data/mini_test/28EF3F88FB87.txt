Schools have different ways of educating people whether if they educate people with special need or not. Parent's have two choices to enroll their kid(s) in. They can either enroll them in a Brick and Motor or enroll them online or known as home school. The difference between Brick and Motor and home school is that Brick and Motor is more public, has a lot more people held in it, and has social interactions while home school isn't public, doesn't have a lot of people held in it, and there is not a lot of social interaction. Is home schooling really beneficial to students? Home schooling has its pros and cons, like if kid(s) have a fear of big crowds or loud noises. The pro is that there is little to no crowds and noises during home school, but the con can be that the student doesn't get the chance to conquer that fear of theirs. Overall home schooling is not really beneficial because students will not get the social interaction they daily need in their life, students may miss the chance to experience new thing happening around in school and will not try to get out of their shell.

Social interaction plays a big role when students are growing up. Social interaction can help students; get new friends, land a job they are trying to get, ask around for help, and to help them be independent. Social interaction can change people whether they are lacking the social interaction or not. If students are being home schooled they won't really get to experience all of the stuff needed in daily life. If students miss out on being social with other students it can affect the way they grow up. Brick and Motor school is not just to take classes and get done as fast as possible, it is also to help you grow and to experience somethings that are needed in a daily life before hand so students are not trying to figure it out later in life. Social interaction helps with also small things in life, like when students are asking someone a question of where something is or being a manager of a store and having to talk to an angry customer. It also helps out with students being able to talk "properly" and it also give students courage and may bring up their self esteem when they have good social interactions with people and to continue to keep trying. When students don't really get to experience it and they may try to socially interact and it ends badly, it can affect the student to may give up, and/or give them depression, or their self esteem about them lowers. Social interaction is a big role play in schools because they want the student to be the best version of themselves.

Experience can either be a good or bad thing. Experience, just like social interaction, helps us grow whether it is a good experience or a bad one. Experience also is the main point for trying out new things in life. Experience may not be as significantly important like social interaction for the things students need in life, for example when students have a good social interaction with people, they land a job to live the life they want, they get a good experience but if they don't have a good social interaction and don't land the job, they get a bad experience and may not be able to pay the bills or get the needs in their daily life. Even though it may seem it is not that important it still plays a big role in the students life and even as an adults. Experience is not really prominent in home schooling as it is in Brick and Motor schools. The reason why is because Brick and Motor schools have clubs for students so they can enjoy what they like or to just try new things and get out of there shell, they also have field trips for some of the classes and friends. Friends is experience because students can see who can tolerate them and if they can tolerate that person or another example can be that if one of the students fail an English test or any other courses that students friend may invite them over for a study session to help them improve on whatever they may be failing at and that is a good and bad experience. Even though most students don't like failing and try to avoid it, failing can be a good experience because it can teach them what they might be lacking in or so they can see what is their strength and weakness and will want to improve it, while having someone by their side to help push them along the way.

People or students may say that home schooling is beneficial because it can help students and parents save time and money to pick their kid up if they have an appointment and they can just pick right off where they left, but when students grow up they are not just going to have time to do what they want, they will be busy most of their life and Brick and Motor helps with that because students have to get on time to their classes. Home schooling can limit some thing or they just don't really have the materials for example students like hands on school work or projects home school doesn't have that. Even though Brick and Motor can't really prepare students every single thing for adult hood, they at least can prepare you a lot better than home schooling. Brick and Motor takes a lot more action to help students to become who they are and help get out of their shell. Even though a lot of students despise or hate school or any form of education that they don't want to learn, in the end a lot of them are grateful for what Brick and Motor has done for them. Home schooling lacks the thing like social interaction, the experience to go on trips or try new things, the hands on experience for students to learn better and clubs for students to enjoy what they like, may harm students in the future. Each thing in a school that one school doesn't have may seem like it is not really that necessary to have it and may not play a big part, actually has a big part to play in a students life. Brick and Motor school is the best and most beneficial for the students when they become an adult because home school cant provide the students what they need in life.
