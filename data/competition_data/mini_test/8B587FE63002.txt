Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Many students forget their knowledge they had learned from the previous year and struggle to find their way and the following year. To prevent this some schools have mandated a summer project to continue the education for their students and to be able to have successful following year. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, teachers know how to prepare students for the following year, students are not capable to create a project idea, and to continue learning for students teacher need to be able to establish their curriculum.

Teachers prepare students for everything involving education, so for a summer project to establish education, it should be teacher-designed. Many students in, Generic_School, unknowingly don't receive parental support, causing them to need teacher guidance. Students cannot achieve everything to do with school by themselves, they need guidance and help. Parental support is a key thing to education in the 21st century, without it students can tend to give-up or not achieve their goals, this would include a summer break project. Teachers are the ones given the curriculum, of what they need to teach, at every school. The curriculum, is a state-wide given material, consisting of the learning objectives for the students, The students would not be able to gain more knowledge without knowing what their objectives are for the following year. A student-designed project would quickly fall apart without knowledge of what they need to be focusing on for the following year.

Many students do not have the capability to be able to come up with project idea. An extraordinary amount of students deal with focusing problems, such as, ADHD. This causes many students to not be able to create and design a "summer" project all by themselves; Students will need guidance form teachers. To be able to design and create a project during a students break could possibly be a hard task, even if they don't have a focusing problem. Most to all students have different levels of achievement. How would teachers grade the different levels of effort put into each project if every students was designing their own? One student could create a beautiful poster, while another just writes a paragraph; How could this be fair to all student if they were designing their own. Many students go on trips or visit family and are unable to take time out of their day for something them have to come up with and/or have the mindset to put effort in to designing and creating a project.

To allow students to continue learning, the teachers need to design a project in order for them to learn. Students do not teach themselves in any school. For a student to gain more knowledge they need to be led and taught by someone who already holds that knowledge. A teacher knows the objectives the student needs to know for the following year. The teachers obtain the future objectives from the state, for the students. The students have no idea what their following grade objectives are, as they have not even been in their future classroom yet. Many students would not be capable of continuing learning if they do not receive any material on their project, and have to design their own. A successful student has the future knowledge handed to them for them to be able to create a project continuing on learning future material.

To prevent forgetting knowledge, some schools have mandated a summer project to continue the education for their students and to be able to have successful following year. Allowing student to design and create their own "summer project" seems like a bad idea, if the school is assuring learning. All students are not capable of preparing themselves the curriculum for the following year, if they are unsure about the material. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, teachers know how to prepare students for the following year, students are not capable to create a project idea, and to continue learning for students teacher need to be able to establish their curriculum.
