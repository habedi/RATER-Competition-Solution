Venus is a planet that is a sister to our planet earth and it looked like earth millions of years ago. Venus was way diffrent apart from earth because the Venus from today is hot and volcanic. Scientists are trying to study Venus so that they can learn more about the planets past and how did it turn into a super hot planet and how did its oceans dissapear. Venus is a really intersting planet that hold a lot of valuable information that scientists want to pull from the planet like how its volcanes formed and why the pressure is soo intense. Venus also has such dangerous storms and is hot at 800 degrees to the surface that made spacecraft's metals melt when they were launched from earth to Venus.

Sceintists are trying to find ways that it could be possible for Humans to to close enough to Venus. NASA is also trying to find a way to battle these harsh conditions in Venus but right now as close as they can get is above the fray in Venus but trying to look at to the ground is gonna be difficult since there are clouds blocking the view. NASA is trying to approach on new ideas so that they can land spacecraft machines to land on Venus to last up to 3 weeks while dealing with the temperature and the extreme pressure, they can collect data and send it back to NASA so they can study how the surface is made and how to find a way to battle the enviorment.

I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of the dangers because if we manage to study the entire system of Venus we can learn how to make Robots that can withstand harsh conditions and extreme pressure and we can also take more precautions when learing how to overcome these climates. Humans will become more smarter and it will also be just a matter of time before we can start sending spacecrafts to planet Neptune and also start colonizing mars. Venus can teach us a lot of things once we are able to gather information about it. The author also supports the Idea because there are ways for NASA to grow more intelligent and explore more planets. NASA is studying Venus eversince they saw it for the first time, they have been trying to study the atmosphere, the surface, whats it made of, the temperatures, and its past.
