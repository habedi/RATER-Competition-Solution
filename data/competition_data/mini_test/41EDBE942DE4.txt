The 'face on Mars" is not an alien created thing but an landform. The way that we can back this up because is they took a second photo and it was clear and you can see that it was just a landform. People said that the photo was cloudy so then they went out again in 2001 and the pixels are much better. They went out again and it was not cloudy either. It was clear that the photo was a landform. The last reason is that people from NSA can back up that the face is actually a landform. Gravan said "that it reminds me of most Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho". He also said " that's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same size of the face on Mars", so don't believe everything random thing a person says who doesn't even know the facts. The "Face on Mars isn't a alien or an alien created thing, but a landform that is on Mars.
