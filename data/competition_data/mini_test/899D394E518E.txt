This year my principal has decided that all students at my school have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities could be to work on the student council, help on the yearbook, participate in sports, and many other activities. Some students strongly disagree with his decision because they would rather go home and sleep or be alone. While other students are very excited about his decision. Would you be happy if you had to participate in at least one after school activity? I am very excited with his decision because I feel like this will help kids get into better shape, be able to hangout and meet new friends, do better in school, and help not put as much stress on their parents.

Even though you may not realize it, but participating in these activities help you be able to get into better shape. It helps the kids that don't do anything on their own start moving more, if they decide to do a sport. Participating in these activities also help you get into better shape because you will probably push yourself to be better than the rest of the students there. A couple years ago a students was overweight, but she started to participate in these activities and she is now in very impressive shape and a lot of people are jealous of her. Even if you don't do a sport you can get in better shape because you are doing more than what your body is used to.

Having to participate in at least one extracurricular activity would give you the opportunity to meet new people and to see some people you rarely get to see. While you are participating in the activity, it would be very easy to make new friends. You would be able to bond very quickly because you most likely have the same interests, considering you both are participating in the same activity. Maybe your best friend moved to a new school, and you only get to see her when you go to your activity. I personally think that activities are more enjoyable when you are able to work with or compete against someone that you know or met.

Studies have proven that kids that participate in extracurricular activities do better in school. While the kids that just go home and play video games or sleep do not do as well in school. Last year, a student that would go home everyday and just lay on bed texting people until midnight got very bad grades and the almost had to repeat seventh grade. Until, he joined a basketball club and all of his grades gracefully shot up. All the sudden, he was one of the smarter kids in his grade. The extracurricular activities help you with school because they not only take some stress off of school; but they also help you find people that you can help each other in school and they make you be able to sleep which refreshes your brain so you can think better in school.

Not only will the principal and students benefiting from this, but the parents will also. They won't have to deal with all the kids problems as much at home because the kids won't have it on their minds will be taken off of it by the distraction of other things by the time they get home. Parents and kids probably won't have as many arguments like they normally do. They also will have somewhere for the kids to go so the parents can get more things done. The parents will also enjoy their kids having better grades. They would also not have to help as much on school work because their kid would probably understand what the are doing in class better. So this decision will work to everyone's benefits.

Although not everyone is happy with the principals decision, he did the right thing. By participating in extra curricular activities it helps benefit everyone. It helps the students get into better shape, be able to meet and hangout with friends, do better in school, and not put as much stress on their parents. When people realize the benefits they will be very happy that he made this decision as well. The students will be amazed about how the activities turn out, and they will probably be much happier students. Overall, the principal made the right decision even though people are fighting against it.
