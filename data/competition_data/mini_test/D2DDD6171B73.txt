Around twenty-five years ago something obscure was found. NASA's Viking 1 was circling Mars and taking photos, little did they know that the would discover the Face.

The Face is indeed a natural landform. The Face is a rock formation with the characteristics of a human face, on the red planet Mars. The article states that the face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.

NASA has been trying to prove the face is indeed a real life occurance. They have worked real hard to get pictures. Mars Global Surveyor is mapping a spacecraft that looks straight down to scan the panet in a narrow 2.5 km-wide strip. They often do not passover the face but when they do they make the most out of it.

Many people have gone crazy for the Face. The Face has appeared in Hollywood movies, novels, magazine articles, radio alk shows, and even grocery stores during halloween. I guess you can say the Face has become the Face for Mars.

Scientist has proven tha the Face is real. The Face represents wha has been or whose to come onto Mars. It has been twenty-five years since the discovery of the Face. Let's hope there is more to come.
