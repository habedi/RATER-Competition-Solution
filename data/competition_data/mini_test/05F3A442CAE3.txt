Knowledge, due to our globalized and technologically advanced 21st-century world, is essentially universal. Anyone can go on the internet and view an abundance of research papers or musical compositions, and gain otherwise inaccessible intelligence from them. The intelligence capabilites of the internet should, and must be, spread to the younger generations. Giving students the ability to learn online from home is beneficial, as they are in a familiar environment where they can learn without fear, build their own structure around their education, and pursue their own individual interests.

Schools, in theory, are supposed to be safe, judgment-free environments. However, for certain students, that is far from the case. Hundreds of thousands of students around the world have been bullied or tormented in schools, and some have received such bad treatment that going to school is no longer a safe option for them. An online education would offer students who have experienced those situations a safe learning environment where they could feel comfortable. While it could be argued that online schools are not 'real schools' that offer a 'real education,'

those arguments are far from the truth. Online schools are just as, if not more, rigorous than regular schools. Students have to be generally self-reliant, as they do not always have a teacher at their beck and call to aid them. The lack of teacher-aid online students get builds practical skills, and prepares them for what life will be like when they are an adult.

Online schools could also provide health benefits to students by allowing them to structure their own time schedules for their education. In an online classroom, students can work at their own pace, and do not have to wake up in the early morning hours. This extra sleep gives students more focus, and helps them learn better. Students pursuing an online education could also take breaks when they need it, which gives them time to meditate or exercise, things that would improve their learning capabilities and their health. Some schools do offer breaks and recess to their students, and some argue that those breaks are enough, but that argument does not take into account that those breaks often stop once students reach high school. Students of all ages need the ability to move and give their minds a rest, especially high school students, who are often under heavy pressure to get good grades for college. Online schools would allow those students time to decompress, which would overall improve both their mental health and decrease their stress-levels, allowing them to educationally flourish.

To be successful in this world, students need to have a variety of different creative skills, and online classes promote the development of them. In a regular school in environment, students are not always able to pursue their own interests. They are in school nearly seven hours a day, and go home with piles of homework to complete, which blocks them from pursuing the skills they want to learn. An online class allows students time to do the things they genuinely want to do. It gives students the time to learn how to cook, play a sport, paint, and just have fun as children. While regular schools do have cooking and art classes, as well as sports, they do not always allow the students to pursue the exact aspect of that skill they want to, as those classes and sports are structured around learning standards that have to be hit. Online classes would allow students the time to express their own creativity and uniqueness, giving them a creative outlet unlike any other.

All in all, online classes would be incredibly beneficial for students. Students would receive a quality education in a healthier, less intimidating, and less stressful environment where they could pursue their own creative interests. Online classes are not a thing of the future, they are a thing of the here and the now. A thing that could, and would, give students all the tools they need to succeed in the world, all while allowing them the chance to be happy too.
