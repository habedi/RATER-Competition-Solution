Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. As explained in paragraph two, there have been many spacecrafts sent to it´s mysterious surface, but not many make it for more than a few hours. It´s also been noted that its atmosphere is too extreme for human encounterment. The author uses these, what may seem like disadvantages to futher exploration, to his advantage. He uses backed up statements like older technology could help and that the dangers are just mere challenges.

The author brought up a good argument that todays advanced technology might a little too advanced to get the job done. As stated in paragraph seven, modern computers have helped a lot with research progress, but that was in enviornments that were better understood. Venus is entirely different, atmosphere, temperature, and pressure wise. It´s going to take something new, or something old, such as the mechanical computers, with some adjustments.

The author also mentioned one thing most people can´t resist - a challenge. Though there are multiple risks to furthur more thourough exploration of this planet, it really is just one huge challenge. Venus alone is challenging some of the most advanced technology on this planet. A challenge that NASA should be willing to overcome.

Venus is a very worthy pursit despite the dangers it comes with. The author does a very well job explaining his aproach on furthur exploration of the complicated planet. He in turn has more than enough details to support it.
