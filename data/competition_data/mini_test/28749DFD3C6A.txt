Venus is Earth's sister plant or as other people like to call it, "Earth's twin" Venus is counted as Earth's sister or "twin" planet because of how close in desity and size Venus is to Earth. Scientists have tried and tried to explore Venus with little robots but the little robots only lasted a couple of hours on Venus's surface, Venus is believed to be uch like Earth is now. Scientists believe that Venus used to be covered in oceans, greenlife and other type's of life before Earth. Scientists are worried to physically go on Venus themselves because of the dangers they will facewhen arriving on Venus, Venus's atmosphere is blanketetd in a thick blanket of almost 97%, there are clouds of sulforic acid, tempertures reach to at least 800 and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. The author thinks that scientists should get up close and personal despite the danger or "challenges" that they fac from Venus because, we could have insights on Venus, we wouldn't get to sample anything, weshouldn't be limited in exploring just because of the dnagers. We should explore to the very edges of imaginations and innovation.
