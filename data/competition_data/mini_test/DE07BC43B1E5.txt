Dear Principle:

I think we should be required to do community service because it could get us ready for high school when we have to do community service for our credits and instead of learning the hard way by having to way up really early and not being used to the schedule and being grumpy we could just get up and be ready to work and know that we have something to do before we stay up all night and not be able to be ready to work and it could also help us when we are out of school it can get us ready for when we have a job as a grownup so that we can earn money to make a living for ourselves and not have to rely on our parents.

Another reason this would be good is because we will learn responsibility in knowing that we have something to take care of and to know that we should do the right thing and help people that are in need so that we can feel good about ourselves and also so that we can know that there's always some way to help someone. We could help out by giving money to shelters so that they can buy food or sending cans to the homeless or even giving them cloths or sheets so they wont be cold at night or maybe even little things like talking to them and telling them not to give up and to try to keep on pushing till they can get there own house and to get a job to take care of there families.

The next reason that we should have to perform community service is because a lot of these stars and stuff don't give back to there community even though they have all the money that they have so you can show the people that someone cares enough to help them instead of flashing all there fancy things knowing that other people have nothing. If you were to watch a show like M.T.V cribs you would see some of those people have things they never even wore or they wore once and never wear it again they could send those nice cloths to the homeless since they aren't going to use them again.

These are all my reasons that i think we should be required to do community service. I also hope you can look into this and try to get a survey to the community to see if we can get this rule out there for the people who need our help.
