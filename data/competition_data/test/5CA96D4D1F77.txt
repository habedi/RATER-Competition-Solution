Dear Principal,

I believe that we should have the right to have our phones at school.

Why I think that we should be able to have our phones is because we might have to talk to our parents, and we don't want other people to wonder what happened to you by going down to the office to call your mom saying that you are sick.

But I also think that it is a good reason that we can't have phones at school, because we would always be on them, in the hallway and class room. We probably wouldn't get good grades in our classes either, because we would be texting the whole time to our friends. " And the students parents wouldn't be very happy, because of the bill that they get from their child texting too much during school!"

So i agree with the rules that have been set already, but i also think that you should give us some permission to call are parents without getting our phone taken away.

Thanks for taking your time to read my letter!

Sincerely,
