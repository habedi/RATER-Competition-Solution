Limiting car usage would make a huge impact on the world today, cars are the cause for most of the 12 percent of greenhouse gas in the U.S, also by limiting cars people would buy less, and ride more, as well as clear the air their breathing on a daily basis.

First off, Cars are known for their release of gas into our atmosphere, making it warmer. According to Elizabeth Rosanthol of the New York Times in source one, cars are the main cause for up to 50 percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emission. Germany has taken an act to this issue and given up their cars. People who are caught driving can actually get a sitation and up to a 25 dollar fine. Which is definitely making an impact on our world today, and for the future.

To second that, limiting car usage would save citizens alot of money, like New Yorks new bike-sharing program for people trying to shift the driving population. This bike program has caused an enormous drop in percentage of people getting their license, because why get it when you can ride a bike? Teens in between 19 and 21 have also not made it a priority to get their license, because organizing their life around where they can walk or take public transport is alot cheaper and better for the environment.

Last but certainly not least, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban because of all the smog in their global city. Everyone was ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and the ones who disobeyed would get a 22 euro fine, or 31 dollars. Congestion went dont 60 percent in a five day period, making it less stressful for drivers or pedestrians to get to their destination. Diesal fuel was blamed for the smog and with 60 percent less cars clogging up the atmosphere it cleared up in a matter of time and effort.

Limiting car usage would have a bigger impact than you think, just by leaving your keys at home you could be saving or globe from greenhouse gas, saving your money, and saving your lungs from the harsh smog it causes in France.
