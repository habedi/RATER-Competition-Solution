Distracted driving is becoming a huge problem in the world today. One of the main distractions is something that most people have with them everywhere they go, it is known as the cell phone. Cell phone use while driving causes many wrecks and injuries every single year. In fact, the majority of crashes every year are caused by distracted driving, due to cell phone usage. This being said, people should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving unless they have a hands-free option.

Many people believe that they are capable of multi-tasking. The main thing people think they can multi-task at is texting and driving. When you are behind the wheel you are always automatically expected to keep your full attention on the road. Failing to do so could result in something as minor as a ticket, or something as major as a wreck that could seriously injure or kill someone. Let's say that you're driving down a not so busy street in a neighborhood. You think that because the street is empty that you should be able to text and drive without any issues, so you pull your phone out to text your mom. You don't even have time to glance down and back up before you run into a solid brick mail box, causing the inflation of your airbags. When that airbag deploys, it causes fractures to your face, and blunt trauma to your cervical spine. Was it worth it?

According to many websites, at least 1.6 million accidents per year are due to texting and driving. Out of these accidents, around 3,500 people are killed and at least 421,000 people are injured. Many states now have laws that require you to be parked in a safe place before using your phone and failing to do so will result in a ticket. In most states you are not allowed to even have your phone on your person while driving. It must be put in a seat or in the console of your car out of reach.

There are reasons upon reasons as to why you should not be allowed to use your phone and drive. Many people don't realize, especially young people, that phone usage while driving can cause your insurance to go up a lot. I'm sure you'd rather put your phone down, than to have to pay extra each month because you had to use your phone. Another thing people don't realize is that when you are on your phone and driving, your reaction time is worse than if you were to be driving under the influence of alcohol.

Texting and driving should never be an option for anyone these days. We have so much hands-free technology, that you shouldn't even have to look at your phone while you are behind the wheel. No matter the situation or who the text is from, if you ever feel the need to pick up your phone, pull into a parking lot and make sure you're safe. Remember next time you put your car in drive and go to reach for your cell phone, how many lives, including your own, that you would be putting in danger.
