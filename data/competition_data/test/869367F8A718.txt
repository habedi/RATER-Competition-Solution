Imagine not having to wake up earlier in order to shower, eat and put clothes on. Some schools have the convinient choice to let students study from home via online courses or through video. Some Students are fortunate enough to learn from their own home so, they wouldnt go through these minor set backs. Many students wish they were able to learn from home and not having to go to a public or private school. Students could also take courses that are nessesary for them and could help them with things that really are needed for the rest of their lives. For these students learning from home brings many benefits because, students would not worry about getting to school, they would still be able to learn whlile sick, and they would learn at a pace they needed to.

First, the students would'nt worry about how they were going to get to school. Students could relax a lot more knowing that they did not have to make those sacrifices to get to school. Having to make it on time to school adds an emense amount pressure to a student, because they know that their teacher would be angry for being late to their class, but when taking online courses they would be able to learn from home and not worry about making it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing becuase being late could have you getting lectures for hours on end and could get you introuble with your administrator, which is why when you learn from home you could do it any time through out your day because its an online course and its available at all times, when you also learn from home you're able to take your time on certain activities and such other tasks. Depending on the weather that could be even more time consuming, for example if its snowing you would have to warm your vehicle up in order to be able to drive it,and for people who walk to school they suffer the most because they have to either sweat or be so cold on the way to school and on the way back.

Second, students would'nt have to make it to school even when sick. Many schools suggest that students should stay home when sick in order to prevent the sickness from getting every other person in that building sick. When a student takes an online course, they could still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things, all because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take the online courses are alot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book untill they complete the test on what ever make up day is assigned to them. When students who take online cources miss the test day they could complete it when ever, just because it's online and it won't have to be taken on hard copy .

Lastly, the student would be able to learn at he pace that they desire. Students who attend public schools know that they dont always move at the desirable pace because their are many others in there learning with them. For example when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or the teacher is really slow. But when online you could have the teacher to please repeat themselves and move at the pace you would really like to. When a teacher has a class of twenty-plus kids she/ he really cant give you undevided attention because there are so many students in that class. For students who take the online classes they could have full attention of the teacher because every student has one specific teacher assigned to just for them, with this they are able to learn a lot more and are able to move from subject to subject alot quicker. The student who take the online class will also move at a much faster rate, because they wouldnt have any sort of distractions, but would give the teacher alot more attention than they would in a public class.

Some schools across the United States offer students the choice to take online courses from home. This helps many students that have problems getting to school and home, it allows students to learn at the pace they will be more successful at, and would help when a student is not feeling well enough to go to school. Many of the students wish they were able to take an online course, which is much better than an online school.
