Dear Principal,

In this letter I hope that I can influence you make working fro community service an mandatory exercise in school. Many of my friends believes that working for the community eats up too much time, and forces them to stay away from what they like to do the most. However, i think that every student must be involved in something that helps the parks, kids, or maybe even the environment. I speak this from experience because OTHER_NAME, a organization requires 30 hours of school hours and 4 hours of community hours. I never managed to get these hours for community service. This is probably since I barely have any time to work. Getting to perform the community allows a person to help the world become a better place. With many national problems such as pollution or education problems, it is necessary that us kids and teens help out. Someday, many of these students may become important leaders that helps the community or the unfortunate people. Although my friends should enjoy the time that they have, many of them usually stays home and play. Game systems or the internet is often why the kids doesn't want to work. But I understand this, since I felt too tired or un-necessary to help. One major hurdle that I found was that I barely got any reward or didn't feel like I had anything accomplished after working for several hours. School should provide better motives for community service. By being required to perform community service, it could lower the moral of kids and show a bad outcome of the work. Students should be forced in a way to work, but also have a fun time if they know that they are eventually be rewarded. Participating in these events, such as helping elementary schools are very important because it gets kids from different age groups to get along. When older teens tutors younger kids, it may show a positive influence. If a older generation of students are required to help, many kids may willingly help the community. In order to get this work, schools should provide more options to chose from. Libraries and parks often takes college or high school kids. This leaves middle school kids in the corner with nothing to do. It may be that because finding a job to be difficult is way kids see that community service takes too much time. Whether or not this letter changes if kids are required to work in the community, I hope that the least this letter can do is to show that not all kids want to spend their time indoors and rather spend some time helping out a certain cause.

from, your student STUDENT_NAME
