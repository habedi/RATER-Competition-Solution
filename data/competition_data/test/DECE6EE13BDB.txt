Dear Principle,

I want to bring your attention to making students do community service. community service will teach the students how to be responsible, because they will have to be responsible for doing their community service, it will keep them out of trouble, because they have something else to do besides go to friends houses, and party, and they have something them, and their family can be proud of because they made their own decision to help the community.

Certainly,

If you decide to make the students do community service, they will become more responsible. For example, the students will have to be on time to their community service job and that will help them to be on time to other things in life. They will also have to be responsible and make sure they help the community, and not forget to do their job, which is like a normal kid doing homework in school. The student has to do their home work, and they can not forget. I think that community service will help them to also be more independent, because they have to do their own duty of something like picking up trash on school property, and they will not be able to have help because it is their own job. At home I am responsible for taking out the trash. That is my responsibility, even though it is the family trash. I take out the trash whenever it needs to be taken out, and I do not even get paid, just like a community service job. I do not always want to take out the trash but with community service, it shows me how if I am responsible I am not only helping myself, but the environment, and the people around me.

Community service will also keep children out of trouble. Some students these days go to party's, and get grounded for several reasons. However, with community service the students will have something to do on their spare time which will lead to not getting in trouble, or being somewhere there not supposed to be. The students will have to be do the community service, but instead of being somewhere their parents can not contact them, they will be building a garden for a school, or helping little kids learn to read, Doesn't that sound better to you? If the students are feeling stressed out they know that they can attend to their community service job instead of doing something bad just to get the stress away. Of course the students could do a community service job with their friends, but the point is that they will be safe and doing something good for the community.

Have you ever wanted to be the only subject at the diner table? The one your parents want to brag about to their friends? Well, I know I do. If you make the students do community service, their family would be so proud of them for stepping up and helping out. Maybe some kids do not do sports, so their parents do not have something to cheer at every weekend, but If a student came home to their family telling them how good they felt about doing community service that weekend, then the parents have something very special to cheer for. Parents of students want their children to do good in school, and if you consider making community service part of your school , then I am sure that you will be getting calls from parents saying thank-you for making my children do community service I am so proud and it has helped them so much. I know that if I helped out the community not only my parents would be proud, but I would be more than proud of myself.

Keep in mind that Some of my friends have already started doing community service on their own, like tutoring elementary school children, and picking up liter on the streets, they told me that it has helped them so much,a nd I would like to be li Therefore, if you could get everyone in the school to do that then Don't forget it would make everyone have so much more responsibility, as well as they would stay out of trouble, and their family and them would be so proud.

I think that it will change student is the most spectacular way, and I hope that you agree as well.

Thank you,
