If all students had to participate in extracurricular activities it would be a good thing. Kids need to do move activities but they should get to pick what it is they are doing. The reason for this is they need to do something they enjoy doing or else they will not do it. There are many activities you can do that many kids enjoy. These are some of them that you can do.

The first one I recommend is marching band. This is an activity that you get to many thing and its very easy. This is not for everyone though. You do have to know how to play an instrument in order to be able to do this. If you already know how to play an instrument then this is the right thing for you. When you are in marching band you split up with your section and you practice with them. Then after you practice with your group you get with everyone else and practice your routine. The most enjoyable part about this is being able to play at sporting events because you get to play more fun songs.

Another activity that you can do is sports. There are so many different sports you can play you just have to find the one for you. Baseball is one of the more popular ones because its not a hard sport to learn. All you have to know is how to throw and catch the ball. The kids who play this would go to after school practices and go to games on the days they have them. Football is another popular sport. It is a little harder to learn but it is a very enjoyable activity. Just like base ball you would go to after school practices and games. Some of the kids already know how to play these sports so they would be in a higher divisions than the beginners.

The last activity listed is more for kids who like learning. These kids enjoy learning new things very day or they might just be struggling so they might need a little extra help. This is like a tutoring but anyone can come learn things. Here they will teach you new ways of figuring things out and showing you new material. The main point of this activity is to help kids learn and understand the topics they are learning about in class. Usually these are about an hour long and you are all in the same classroom. This activity is not for everyone because some people already understand what they are doing in class.

Making kids do extracurricular activities is a good idea. Kids can have a lotÂ of fun doing these as long as its something they enjoy doing. If the kids got to choose what they wanted to do they would like doing then this would be a good idea. In my opinion if kids did more than one activity they should get extra credit. These are just some of the things you could do after school but they are not for everyone so make sure you pick something you enjoy.
