I disagree with the principles decision to force the kids to participate in extracurricular activities because, First some kids might not have time for the activities, secondly some kids have non school related activities, and lastly some kids may not like the activities they get to choose from. Generic_Name came home crying thinking about what the principal said in the assembly,"The teachers and I have come to the decision that everyone must participate in at least one extracurricular activity starting in two weeks." "I cant do that!", Generic_Name said crying on his bed. "I have travel soccer, and if I miss practice I'll get kicked from the team." Generic_Name put his hands over his face and said,"what am I going to do?" "I need to tell the principal that he cant make kids participate in school related activities." So Generic_Name sat down and started to wright.

Dear Principal Generic_Name, I got three reasons why you shouldnt force kids to do extracurricular activities. The first being some kids dont have time for the activity chosen, or given to them. For example, If you have a little sibling and your parents work late hours you have got to be there to take care of them. My friend is a good example of this because his parents always have late work hours, and so he needs to take care of his three sisters, But he cant do that if you make him do an extracurricular activity. My second example of this is my friend Generic_Name. He has very stricked parents and they dont allow him to stay at school past 3:45, and if he does he gets in big trouble.

The second reason being some kids have non school related activities. A lot of kids I know have sports after school and sometimes its there only fun of the day. Im a good example of that because, I have travel soccer after school and sometimes soccer is my escape from the teenage world. Another good example is my best friend Generic_Name. He plays travel hockey, and if he misses a certain amount of practices he will get kicked off the team and that will break his heart, so do you really want to be the one that breaks all thees kids hearts?

The theerd and final reason being that some kids may not like the activities that they have to choose from. For example a kid I know only likes the sport fencing, But unforchanetly the school doesnt provide that activity, so he will have to go and do another sport that he wont enjoy. The last example is a kid i know that doesnt even like sports. for instance she is not athletic, and she cant throw or ketch a ball, so she would be miserable in the activity shes in. To add on to this I saw her face after the assembly, she looked like she was about to cry. The point of me writing this is so people dont come to school and see all of the sad faces, and the last thing we want is a bad reputation of this great school.

Two days after Generic_Name turning in his essay he was called in to the principles office. "Generic_Name!", Mr Generic_Name said in a hard voice. "You make a good point in this essay." "Really?"Generic_Name, said in a surprised tone. "Indeed, I havent read an essay this good in a long time." "Im going to make a special announcement this morning about this, so make sure you are listing, OK?" "Yes seer", Generic_Name said with a big grin on his face, and went off to class. Wail Generic_Name was in class talking about what just happened the announcements came on. "Good morning everyone, I have a special announcement today." "I had a kid this morning come to me and widen my eyes about my decision at the assembly, and because of him I have changed my decision, so you dont need to participate in extracurricular activities if you choose not to." "Thank you Generic_Name, thank you." The hole school lit up in joy, and as the day came to an end,Generic_Name held his head up high and walked to his mom's car.
