I think that use of technology like this in classrooms could be a dangerous prospect. Many things could go wrong with technology like this and could have some major consequences.

First teachers could end up losing their jobs. All of this stems from what has happened in history. Take factories as an example, factories used to be full of people making and producing everything, but the recent surges in robotic workers has left many without jobs that would have otherwise been a great livlihood. This same thing could very well happen to teachers with little to no warning.

Second off there are people that are affraid to have cameras or video monitors on their children because they are known to have been hacked into and can lead to crimes including kidnapping and robbery. Adding this sort of computor facial recognition software could increase hackability of a schools network or technology. Sometimes hacks can go undetected for days or weeks at a time and once you find out it has been happening it is suddenly too late.

Finaly it would be a huge change for everyone that is currently enroled in pulic schools. Once you reach students above grade 4 it could be a struggle to get them on a different "type" of learning such as a computor program that can mold the lesson to a persons emotions. You also lose a sort of connection to the teacher. Most people remember certain teachers for certain reasons, whether they were funny, told stories, truly cared about students, or were just overall a great teacher, but all of this would be lost because no computor at this point has TRUE intelligence, some may mimic actions of intelligent life but none has achived it yet.

Adding this sort of program to schools could be extremely dangerous in many ways. People would be at risk for losing jobs, school-wide hacks, and a true emotional and phisical loss.
