Dear principal,

I have been informed about certain schools requiring their student body to perform various community service activities. Me being part of this schools large student body, is not proud of such a huge decision. If you think about it volunteering is a great help to communities and some of the people volunteering themselves. Most students though really need to perform community service. For example, students that are part of SCHOOL_NAME have to get volunteer hours. Some people just don't have time to complete such tasks. In fact 65% of American students are given so much homework and projects they only have 12% of time left in the day to do different activities. It is a large request to enforce such an important rule so I would not require students to do community service, unless told to do so. I would let my pupils of this school be given many opportunities to perform community service though. Hopefully you will not enforce this rule at our school. Make the right decision and know what this impact might have on the student body.

Sincerely, an informed student
