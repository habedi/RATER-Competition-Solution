There are man things in this world that can be believed. In this case we shouldn't believe that the face on mars was created by an alien life form. We really cant believe something that has been supported by many facts and evidence. There are many reasons to why we should't believe that.

One of the three reasons is that according to the excerpt, scientists figured it was just another martian mesa,"common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian Pharaoh." This shows that the figures were common around those areas but this one in particular had shadows which resembled an eyptian Pharaoh. Also, a few days after that NASA found out that the shadpows formed an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth but we really can't trust this if it's a coincidence or actually true. Well that's when they're wrong thinking that it was created by aliens.

Accoring to paragraph seven, on April,5 1988, when mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, a team snapped pictures ten times sharper than the ones the viking took. these pictures showed that the "alien created" landform was actually a natural one. The text supports this by showing that the they took way more sharper images which made them way more credible then the ones they took before because you could see the actual natural landform. Although he pictures were ten times sharper, there was still clouds which made the image hard to see making it not reliable.

Finally, the landform was a natural one for this reason. In paragraph 12, he text shows that ,"what the picture ctually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho," says Garvin which really shows that the butte or mesa is really similar to the the Face on mars which can actually be one. also, "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as th Face on Mars.

To sum it all up, the article had a couple sources of evidence to support the fact that the Face was really just a natural landform. Also, there are many sights of evidence to show why believing that aliens created the landform was eally wrong. After all we should ll believe in something that is credible and supported with many details an evidence.
