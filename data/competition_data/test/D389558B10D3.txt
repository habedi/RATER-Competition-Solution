Participating in extracurricular activities at school is something most people do when they are in middle school, high school, or even college. While most people already do a sport or a club of some sort most of the kids don't do anything extra with their school. When doing extra activities many people will probably meet new friends or just simply talk to different people that are outside of their normal friend group or comfort zone. Doing different activities can help out your school and surrounded communities that are in need of some help. Giving students something to do outside of school can really help a child learn and develop new skills that they didn't know they had before. Having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school is a good idea because it can give the students something to do after school, help out their school and community a little, and even make and or meet new friends.

To begin, when students aren't at school they are probably playing on their phones or electronic devices. So, by having them doing something fun that isn't just school work or homework could benefit each student in many different ways. One way is just not having them sit on their butts all day doing absolutely nothing like they would normally do after school. Acting like a pig all hours of the day. It could also get them healthy, by losing weight and gaining muscle at the same time. A child could be a little over weight and by giving them some type of physical activity it could change their world around from what it was to what it is now. Doing each different activity could teach a kid many different skills that they didn't known they had before and could one day even develop into they future career. By teaching one child something they could then go and teach maybe a hundred of other students the same skill they learned from someone else and change the world for them. Then, the cycle will just keep repeating itself again and again until that job is no longer needed in society.

Another reason, why forcing students to do a extracurricular activity is that they would be helping out their school in many different ways. If they played any type of sport they could help win a game or a contest of some sort that is not only a sport, it could be a science fair projector a club project. The more and more school functions that the students go to the more they will begin to like high school and want to go to everything that is possible to go to. Their school spirit would start to shine through at school and then later into sport games and pep rallies and just simple daily life. Depending on what activity they chose they could start to clean up outside and inside the school. They could create new and better ideas for not only the school but the surrounding communities and even all over the world. They could help out the local communities that might need help at the time from just a simple fix or all the way up to a disaster of some sort.

By doing this, the school would start to feel more beautiful and look even more beautiful on the inside and out.

Lastly, when someone is in any type of activity whether it be dance or music classes or school activities you are always going to be meeting new people from not only the same school but other schools or even states to. By doing any of those activities listed above you are somehow and somewhere going to break out of your shell at some point. Whether it be a tiny step of even a gigantic step that you didnt see coming or even notice. By getting out of your comfort zone you may feel more comfortable around other people that you didn't used to feel comfortable around before all of the school activities were started. You may then want to do more activities at your school and all other the reasons that are listed above will start to shine though and you may start to become a whole new person. You may meet new friends and other friendships will form, and change many different things about your life and how it was going to play out before all of the school activities were started.

In conclusion, having to do a school activity would be a great thing for almost all types of schools and students around the world to start doing. Giving the students something to do outside of school can get them fit and healthy along with many other positives to that. When helping out their school they can show off the school spirit and love that each student is being to have for their school. While doing all of those things you are sure to make a friend or two along the way that will help get you out of your own comfort zone and do the path of life with. Giving students something to do, helping out their school to some degree, and meeting or making new friends along the way are all good reasons why making sure that every student does one type of school activity throughout the year. Without having some sort of activity outside of school most students would just be like a whole bunch of dirty slobs that eat and go to school.
