I don't think there should be a limit on car usage if you bought it you can ride till the wheels fall off it's your propery but also recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes. But America's love afair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peeked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. as of April 2013,the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the eplanation certainly lie  in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyways. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next years will be telling.
