I believe that Venus is worthy enough to study and go visit even including the danger it might have or will have. I decided that it is worthy enoough because we dont know whats out there, for all we know there could be real life living people in Venus and we just never knew becuse we though it was to dangerous. Now days technology is so good that they could most likley build a body suit that will make you be able to survive in Venus for a certain amount of time or for atleast enough time to go around and see what its about. Even in paragraph 8 in this story it says "Striving to meet the challemge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors". So that pretty much shows that scientist/people think that Venus possibly could have living humans, they just won't know until they can find a safe way to make it there and back.
