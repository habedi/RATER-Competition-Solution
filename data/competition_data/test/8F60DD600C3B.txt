Extra curricular activities can be fun, and exciting for some students to enjoy, and participate in. But others may find the activities time inducing, and pointless. Other students could also have things they do out of school, like for example, sports. Making it impossible to do these activities. But Some of the students who have an interest for the activities will use it as ways to meet new people, and create hobbies.

Participating in extra curricular activities can be can be good for people who are interested, but the students should have a choice if they dont even want to be apart of something they aren't interested in. The reason is that some students may have out of school activities, preventing them the ability to do these extracurricular activities, or the student may have a medical issue, like for example, asthma. In which, they wont be able to do certain activities, or any at all for that matter.

Transportation can also be and issue for some students, not all students have a ride home if the school bus isnt there. And sometimes their parent wont be able to get them after school, due to work, or traffic. Which will prevent students from being able to participate in these activities if they dont have a ride home.

On the other hand, extracurricular activities can have positive outcomes. Some students will be able to find new ways of expressing themselves and become friends with people that share the same hobbies as themselves. But thats only if they're interested and WANT to join these sports, clubs , etc.

The school should not make extracurricular activities a "must" and assume that the students will be able to do these activities, without knowing about the things preventing the students from being able to do these activities. And some may not even want to be apart of it, because not everyone is interested in sports, or yearbook club.

My conclusion is that students should always have a choice, and not be forced into being apart of extracurricular activities they dont want to be apart of. also due to things they do outside of school, medical issues, and having no way to get home after, prevents them from being able to participate.
