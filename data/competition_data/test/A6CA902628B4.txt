You're running late for work, but you still have to drop the kids off at work. Or maybe you overslept and have to get to school soon. You get everything ready for the day, jump into your car, and you drive off. Cars are very important in todays society, but limiting your car usage can have its advantages. Reducing the amount of times you use your car could help the environment, the economy, and the developement of the city you are living in.

Pollution is a topic that is heard of everywhere, yet we don't take action to prevent it. Limiting your car usage could help contribute to helping the world get rid of pollution in the air. Paris typically has mor smog than other European capitals due to their usage of diesel fuel. Diesels make up about 67 percent of vehicles in France. Paris has tried to stop people from using their cars so much and is fining them if they are. Eventually, due to so much smog and diesel usage, people will have to stop using their cars so much if they want to be abe to see where they're going when driving.

The economy will benifit from the limited usage of cars. Think about it, if we use our cars less, we don't run out of gas as fast as we usually would. If we don't run out of gas, we don't spend as much money trying to fill the tank. If we don't buy as much gas, the price of gas will decrease due to the amount the pipelines are able to store and generate at the same time. If we limit our usage of vehicles, insurance costs will decrease because people are not driving as often and there aren't as many accidents happening.

The developement of the city you live in will change in a good way for you if you limmit the usage of your vehicles. It used to be that people in thr old days wanted to move out as far as possible from their neighbors for "space". The areas and cities just kept on expanding an dit would take longer to get somewhere in town. People wanted to live in suburbans and have a job in the city. This increased the usage of cars and other vehicles. Now, people are starting to move back into the city, amking it denser. Once you live in the city, you wouldn't have to use your car to go grocery shopping beacsue there is a publix or walmart right across the street from you. People in these dense cities will start to walk or ride their bikes to work.

Parents wouldn't have to worry about being late and still having to drop of their kids. While the parent is able to drive twice to-and-from work, the kids could go to-and-from school by walkin or riding their bikes. This cuts off the usage off the car. Instead of dropping of the kids and then going to work and then going to pick the kids up and then head home, know you won't have to do that.

Limiting the amount of time you use your car for can help the world and yourself. You save money, time, and the planet all at once by using your vehicles less. On the outskirts of Freiburg, Germany, residents in a community are forbidden of street parking, driveways, and home garages. Car ownership is allowed, but you would have to park in a large garage at the edge of the developement. Along with this, you eould pay $40,000, with a home, to be a car owner. These methods are being used more and more to stop the great and unreasonable usage of cars.
