Dear principal,

I think we should have to do community service in our community because it will help us and the people around us. If we do community service to help our enviroment then there will be less pollution and that would help out a lot. Like when you see trash on the ground all you need to do is pick it up every little thing helps. Then when people go and help teach kids how to read and read to them that's helping them. Like how we have the club at our school that goes over to SCHOOL_NAME and reads to them and when i was in 5th grade my class would go to the first graders every now and then and read books to them it was pretty fun too. It wont hurt us either it will just make us and the other person stronger mentally. When we clean up around our neighborhood its helping us.

So this is why i think we should have to do community service.
