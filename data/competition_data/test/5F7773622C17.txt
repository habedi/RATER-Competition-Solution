I don't think that students should have to have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. There are many students who have a C average and do good in school who play sports. If they cant play a sport without B average there will be less students who can participate in school related sports and activities and they might consider getting arid of them. I think it would be very unfair to the students. Some students might try very hard to get there grades up and they are at a C average, well other students don't even try and they get an A average. I think that if you get below a C students should get some help, and when they get there grades back up they can go back to play that sport. Also students who participate in activities shouldn't have to stop because they have a C average. It would be unfair to have students stop something that they enjoy doing. Student should be able to enjoy sports and other activities without having to worry about there grades all the time.
