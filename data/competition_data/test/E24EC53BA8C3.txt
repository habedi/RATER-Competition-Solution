Hey have u ever wonder what it wood be like in other countryes well u could find out if you were on a cattle boat as what some people would call a sea cowboy and if you've read the articale a cowboy who rode the waves u would know that luke bomberger was a sea cowboy and from just reading things he seaid like going acropolis greece was special and so was thaking a gondla ride in venice, italy that just made it sound fun to be a sea cowboy but we might never get to know what thats like since we haven't had a war that left a place in ruines sicnes i think ww2 so now we may never get to know what it was like to do what luke bomberger did in the years after ww2 but we can only imagen how cool that would be to do what he did but it's 2016 now and we have new things were worrying about and most people have probaly forgot what this is or most just don't know or care but i think its cool that he did that and i want to do it to some day.
