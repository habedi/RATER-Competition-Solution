Are you passionate about chess, football, or debate? Luckily, most schools have clubs for those activities. Extracurricular activities are very helpful in the success and improvement of students. All students should be required to do one or more extracurricular activities. When doing and extracurricular activity, students can learn new skills, meet new people, and grow awareness for a cause, issue, or group.

Students want to learn about things outside of what they're testing for, and extracurricular activities are the perfect opportunity to do that. There are activities where you can learn to bake, sew, play chess, play basketball, or even learn about other countries and cultures. Students should be required to learn skills outside of History, English, Math, or Science. Students should have more opportunities to learn about life outside of those subjects. Adults might not use polynomials or graphs every day, but they most likely cook every day, so students should have an opportunity to learn how to cook.

Another reason extracurricular activities should be required because you can meet new people. When I first moved to Virginia I didn't know anyone, I was scared and didn't have any friends. By doing extracurricular activities, I found a great group of friends that are passionate about the same things I am. One of my friends recently tried out for our school play, she got in, and now she is much closer with everyone involved in the play. After spending many weekends and days after school in the drama department, she made many new friends and grew closer with old friends too.

Extracurricular activities also grow awareness for illnesses or groups. If it weren't for fundraisers, I wouldn't know about illnesses like ovarian cancer, or dementia. Many schools also have a diversity club where students can raise awareness about different cultures and embrace their differences. Diversity club can ensure people that it's okay to be different and that no one is the exact same. Through the partners program at my school, I learned that special needs people are still people and that you should treat them with the same respect you would give anyone else.

All in all, Some people think that we shouldn't be required to do an extracurricular activity, but I disagree. I think that all students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities teach students new skills, like chess, help students make new friends, and grow awareness for many issues. You can contact your principle, via email or call him/her, and tell him/her that extracurricular activities should be a requirement. Extracurricular activities are important, and help not only me, but others improve as well.
