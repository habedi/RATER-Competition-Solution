NASA discovers a mesa and mistakingly takes it as a sign or symbol created by Aliens, First of all we are hard working humans striving everyday wasting time on things that don't make sense but we care about. So even if it was something like going to space for a few days you're down because its something new, Now.. think about this if you were on a ship in space what would you have done? Taken over the world below? No. because you're already gonna be used to space like we are on earth as we also are too much wanting. We can never be satisfied. We want to see it all! But think again is it possible to do these things? Travel in time or Ride a hovercoaster? No. Well at least not in our generation, But a time is coming most likely we will have those things before we even know it. We only can be sure of things we see not what we can hear.
