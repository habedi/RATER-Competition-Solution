Extracurricular activities can create new friendships and expose you to new friend groups. If you struggle to find friends in your normal school day then extracurricular activities can help! Most of my friends today were formed through extracurricular activities. You may be loosing the opportunity for so many new friends by not participating in these activities. There is a whole world of fellow students waiting to meet you, these activities will expose you to them.

Many of these activities will improve your education while having fun. Math club and Science Olympiad are great examples of this. These activities are less stressful than regular classes, but can help you to fully understand your topics. Virginia Readers Choice was a activity that most elementary schools participated in. V.R.C. helped my reading speed and comprehension, but was fun at the same time. To this day I still go back to read V.R.C. books. Extracurricular activities can improve your learning experience forever.

Some extracurricular activities can boost your physical and mental health. By participating in these you will always come home happier and healthier. Most sports will teach you important life skills and qualities while getting you in great shape. Football taught me perseverance, responsibility, cooperation, and courage. These qualities will be with me for the rest of my life. Extracurricular activities will improve your life in many ways.
