Dear Principal,

I am a student of your school just voicing my opinion. Policy one sounds a lot more convenient us. We should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school. These devices are used for connecting with someone not close to you. And I do agree that the phones should be off and put away out of sight. But policy two just seems ridiculous. You can't bring cell phones at all to school. That's just not right at all. We should be allowed to have them and use them in our extra free time. I believe we should confirm with our teacher before use though. Lets say, we couldn't bring our cells to school. If there is an emergency it would a lot more easier to get in contact with the student if they had their phones. It is a lot more heartache you would have to go through to call the school, and find out what class you in, etc. But I do understand why you wouldn't allow them. Some students abuse their power by using it during class and while the teacher may be giving instruction. But you can't put every student in the same boat because a couple of students have done wrong. Everyone should not be punished because another student chose to do wrong by the rules. Now if a phone is in use and they get caught, take it from them and they don't get it back until the end of the day. If students have phones, please permit them. We have them because its the first line to communicate with our parents/guardians. They are also to socialize with our peers and friends. I on the behalf of the student body really hope you are considering granting us the use of our cell phones during school hours only in our spare time.

Thanks,
