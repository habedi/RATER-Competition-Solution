Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think that you should change the school grade average to a B for sports and other activities because some student are not use to scoring that high. I'm sure they can if they really put all they got in their school work but you changing it will make them think that the expectations are too high and my not want to participate in any school activities. With no activities to enter in for the students then our school can not compete in events with other schools thus for no accomplishments, such as championships rating the school. When student with a high G.P.A that all so like to participate in school activities, are looking for schools to go to and they see ours they may not want to consider it. You know even if those things such as sports, kids want to be the next Michael Jordan or Tom Brady cause those people influence them.
