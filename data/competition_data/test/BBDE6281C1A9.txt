Do you want to become a hero someday? Ever wonder if people need help in diffrent countries? If so,you should probably join the "UNRRA" (the United States Relief and Rehabilitation Administration),people who hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped over seas.

I think people should join the program becuase it takes you places all over the world and it takes you to places you probably never been or known of before. I know this becuase in the passage it states that both boys Luke,and Don had traveled all over the world. It states that they traveled to Europe and crossed the Pacific Ocean twice.

Another reason,is that goes and helps people recover from the ruins of World War II.I know this becuase in the passage it states that Don and Luke traveled to help people recover from the ruins of World War II in Europe,to help them with food supplies,animals,and much more.

If I was eligitable to go,I would go becuase i like to help people. To put a smile on their faces. I hope you join.
