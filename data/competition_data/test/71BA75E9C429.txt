Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am sending this letter to you today to try to persuade you to change your mind about the schools athletics policy. My reasons why you shouldn't change the policy is because most students are making a C as a grade average, and if you change the policy to where all students must be making a grade average of a B our school will barely have an athletics department. Once our school barley has an athletics department you will not need as many coaches, and you will need more teachers to tutor the kids that make the average grade of a C. This leads me to my next reason why you shouldn't change the schools policy of athletics.

My next reason is because kids may not be able to participate in athletics at this school they will start to transfer to other schools in the district, and on top of that the schools reputation will lose its popularity, or advocacy. Then after the school gets a bad reputation parents will not want to send there kid to school there, you will lose money, and you might eventually have to close down.

This is why I urge you to not change the schools athletic policy, and this is why think this school is perfect the way it is.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
