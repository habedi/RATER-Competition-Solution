The Natural Face

The Face is just a natural landform. I work as a scientist at NASA, and I know that the image taken of the face was not created by aliens. The article, "Unmasking the Face on Mars," tells how the truth is revealed. I can prove that the Face is just a landform and not some superstitious icon.

First of all, back in 1976, the quality of pictures and images probably aren't going to be that outstanding. The pictures are blurry and they are the first documented pictures of that landform. I know this because paragraph seven states, " And so on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." Later in paragraph seven, the text says,

There was no alien monument after all." This is why the Viking's pictures aren't credible sources, and that people shouldn't trust the Face in that picture.

Now, some might say, back then, that the alien markings are hidden by the haze. The text in paragraph eight says why,"The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet." However, later pictures still prove that the alien creation was not real.

The MGS images prove that the Face is just another landform on Mars. This is because the MGS was able to get another photo. Paragraph 10 states, Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look." At a moment like that, the time for taking a picture is perfect.

To add on to that cloudless day, the photo taken is eaxtroardinary. In paragraph 10 Garvin says, ""Malin's team captured an extroardinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" The paragraph also states, "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." The quality is exceptionally clearer than the picture taken in 1976. The cracks and clear image show that there aren't any aliens, but that the Face is nothing but a huge rock formation.

In conclusion, the Face is just a rock formation on Mars. Back in 1976, the quality of pictures weren't that great. Through time though, the quality of pictures did get better, and the MGS was able to take a picture of the Face on April 8th, 2001, showing that it was a rock, or, "The Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West," as paragraph 12 says. The Face is a landform, not an alien creation.
