dear principal

I disagree with you because there might a few students that try hard to get a better than a C. you should at least make it a D average. if they have a C- warned and they get a good grade in no time. there a lot of people in the school that very at sports. I say we give a chance to improve themselves and not waste their talent. i get it you are not stasfied by the idea but give a chance. i promise you it will work. everyone will be happy. it will be like hit one stone with two birds. I get it that you the students to get a good grade but just try my idea. that way we can all be stasfied by the new change. although after school activities are a previllage and not a rights we still need it. that is why i strongly believe that you should use my idea.
