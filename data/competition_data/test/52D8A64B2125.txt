The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identfy the many emotions of humans. This was designed to improve the accuracy in perceiving emotions of people around you. This system gives better opportunities for humans and computers to communicate. By moving the muscles in your face, it creates a facial expression, which is then compared to a face that is showing no emotion. This system would be valuable in a classroom because it help teachers relate to students and how they can improve their teaching to make things more fun and understandable, as well as recognizing personal situations.

The Facial Action Coding System helps teachers relate to their students by knowing how they feel about a lesson and how the teacher explains it. The texts states, "'A classroom computer could recognize when a student it becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor.'" Knowing how a student feels can help a teacher immensely. This can show what activities and tactics help students most and some things that do not help at all. This could result in the improvement of grades and understanding of what is being taught.

The Facial Action Coding System can also help with the personal life that may be brought into a classroom. If someone is being bullied or is having problems at home, this may be a way for it to be recognized if the person is afraid to say anything. According to the text, "'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang." This gives teachers and adults ability to recognize and resolve issues that may not have been known about before.

Many students everywhere tend to hide their emotions and thoughts because they are afraid of consequences, whether it is mentally, physically, or emotionally. The Facial Action Coding System can help in ways people can't just by asking someone how they feel. This program can be used to help people in need whether it is relating to learning skills or regarding personal problems taking place at home or school. This gives opportunites to help in many situations and would be very effective in schools.
