Dear principal,

It has come to my attention that u are considering changing the policy on school sports teams so that only students with a B average may participate.

Most students in the school have a C average.

By changing the grade average requirement some of the schools best athletes wouldn't be able to compete in the school sports teams.

By changing the grade average this would put down some students dreams to be on professional sports teams. I strongly advise you to appeal the requirement of a B average

Average students in the school get Cs it is unfair to these students to tell them they cant be on a team simply because they do not have the required G.P.A.

Most sport loving students don't meet this new requirement.

Some of the best students on the teams have a C average.

Some students dreams in life are to be on professional sports teams.

By telling them they cannot participate in a school sports team due to grades might discourage them.

These students might be good at sports but never given the chance to prove it.

Some professional athletes got bellow a B average and they are wealthy and successful people. Every principal should want that life for their students. Some students with outstanding grades drop out of high school and never get jobs. A B average should not matter when a student wants to participate is a school activity.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
