I am against this article ! Imagine a place where there are a lot of obese, lazy etc people in the world this would not help us in either way . By having cars that run for them selves would make people lazier then they already are today! I feel like we should keep the traditional way as of today , yes there are accidents but when a car runs for its self you dont know what can occur. People could be sleeping while they're car is moving and wake up the next day in heaven. But, there are advantages too this like you could drink alchool and be alright for those who drink, you can call or text while the car is moving etc ! Therefore, it can be safe if its approved and it could be dangerous because ther ewould be car owners that would have the old fashioned cars of today and crash into these new move by them self auto mobiles. As it mentioned in paragraph 2 " They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues" what if your asleep when this happens! What can you do is my question?
