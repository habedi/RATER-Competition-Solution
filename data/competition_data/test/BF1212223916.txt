I disagree with the decision that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.

Here are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.

However there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricular activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.

I think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.

In conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.
