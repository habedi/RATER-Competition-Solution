The author tells how Venus is worth going to see as a challenge because no one has manned to stay on the surface for more than a few hours to see how it is and see the challenge of it because in paragraph 2 it says "not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades".

Venus is a planet close to earth it is a planet where not many people go to see for reasons like its dangerous,, its average over 800 degrees fahrenheit that not many people survive going to see it, its powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes but the NASA still send people to study it.

Venus is dangerous because of its tempeture and hoe risky it is but the NASA has ideas of still sending people up there to study it like for example in passage 5 "Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."

its telling how they can still go up there to study it the just have to make there spaceships out of silicon carbide and they say in passage 7 "it last for three weeks in such conditions" so there making ideas and plans how to get up there to still study it cause its important to then and they look at it as a challenge.

In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author is saying explore it but then he is saying be safe at the same time because of the danger that can happen but he wants you to still look at it as a challenge and see if you can do it or not because there is people still studying it and still making plans to do it.
