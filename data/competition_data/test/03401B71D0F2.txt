When I was younger I always dreamed of being able to go to school at home. Now I could have the opportunity to do just that.

When having online classes at home it could benefit students in many different ways. It could be beneficial for kids who are sick and unable to make it to school and it could also save the school system money. If all schools offered this distance learning there is not any doubt many students would jump on the train to participant. Distance learning is very helpful in many ways so why not do it?

Firstly, if students were to be sick or unable to make it to school, they would not have to worry about missing any work because all of it would be online. When I have been sick in the past I always seem to return to school feeling overwhelmed in the amount of work I have to complete. If students had the opportunity to have all their work online and not stress about being out sick, they could finish their work and not worry about having to make it up. If all schools offered this imagine the amount of people wanting to try it. This would be a great opportunity for kids to not have to miss class.

Secondly, it could save the school system money. Schools have to pay out to teachers, cafeteria workers, cleaners, and utilities. If having the opportunity to throw away some of those expenses why not do it? Several schools have been shut down for the lack of money, I believe this could have helped them stay open. I think if schools went to working at home it could save them any trouble that occurs in the long run. Schools are not cheap and if they have the opportunity to cut cost it could benefit them in many ways.

Therefore, some say students would not work as hard at home rather than at schools. But it has been said kids are more motivated when in a comfortable and safe environment. When students are more motivated they are more likely to get more work done and finish assignments on time. This could help kids finish their course faster and move on to the next class. Also students would be not as stressed about school and be able to work at a steady pace. If distance learning was offered to students how could it not benefit them?

In conclusion, having the opportunity to work at home could be very beneficial for kids. It could benefit them when they are unable to make it to class. It could also benefit the school system with the unnecessary costs. If school systems offered this the more growth and motivation would improve in students. Moreover, I believe having distance learning would benefit school systems and students in many ways.
