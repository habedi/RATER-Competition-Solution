Why do you think work experience is always important? Why the athletes are having passion at a sport that they play? Everyone doesn't know how to do things until they learn or practice it a lot. When I was seven, my mom usally ask me to do an extracuuricular activity, so I chose doing tennis. I have lots of fun and learn a lot throughout the lession. I even got to go visit some famos tennis players. We learn a lot and have fun or even gain experience. Every students should participate in at least one extracuuricular activity, because this can help them gain experience as they got older.

This is a great experience to all student that participate an activity, such as a sport team, work on the yearbook, or even serve on the student council. Student should try things that they love or having passion in it no matter what. Getting more experience will also help you with getting in a good college or getting a job that you like. When you are interest in one thing, you should go for it and not wait for it. Everyone should have something that they love or interest in it. You should always go for your goal and gain experience from doing extracurricular activity. Another reason is doing a sport can help you get healthier and even forgetting all the stress from school. Students suffer from school and can not do what they want, so this is also a program that helps student find their interest and forgetting all the stress.

When serve as a student council, this could be fun as the student vote for you and you learn how to become a better council and how to managane your school. This can help you gain experience when you want to become a manager or even make your own company. Sometimes, extracurricular activity can even help you with learning. Some activity can give you the best way to learn throughout the lession. When you are doing a sport team, you learn teamwork and make friends. Having a friendship is always important to a team, you can learn from others. When I already having lots of fun in tennis, I started to try something else, then I got in to a school basketball team. I have lots of friends there, although it is sometimes a stress of lossing to another team, but we still learn the lession from it. When wining a game, we are so happy even go to a resturent to celebrate our victory. This is so important, becuase we can make lots of friends and even wining the game.

Overall, I think this program is a really good experience to all the students that participate in it. It benefits all students when getting older and learn a lot throughout the entire lession and learn from others. Students should always try new things, listen to one anothers opinion, learning how to respect others, and having a open-minded and intelligent. Finally, Every students should participate in at least extracurricular activity.Â
