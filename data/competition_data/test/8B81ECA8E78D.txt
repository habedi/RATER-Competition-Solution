Dear Principal,

If my principal is considering to change the policy that students have to have a B grade average or above I would go to a school that didn't have that policy but had a policy that I would like.

I don't think that's fare for just students that got a C average grade and that can't play sports. If they are passing the grade to go to the next grade why can they not play sports if that are passing with a D or above that average. I would write a letter to the principal and tell him not to do that or I will tell all my friends at this school that we will miss with you until you get tied of being miss with. I would have a fit about the school policy that the principal was changing about you must have a B grade average to play sports. I think he should change the policy you must have a C grade average to play any kind of sports. If C is a average grade why want you lit them play there sport at what they are good at so when they get to collage they would know some moves and learn how to play good ever more.

Sincerely,
