Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME

I think that i would be a very bad and mean idea to not let any student with at least a be average to play sports. i feel this way because you may have amazing athletes that have a c average that can play now because you made this dumb rule. Also it would be a bad idea because your school teams may not be as good if you were to change the rule. I think it would be reasonable to make it so that they would have to have at lease a minimum of a c average to play. I a student could maintain a c average then that in most cases means that the are trying in school. Anyone with anything below a c average would have to get there grades up to be able to participate in the sport. I would very much appreciate it if you would take the time to read other students opinions also. Due to the fact that some student would think otherwise on the subject. Thank you for the time and reading the response to this.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
