This is the age that students should start to find new hobbies, passions, and goals they wish to have for the future as well as have available careers and colleges. I agree that students should participate in after school activities, here's why.

This idea could bring students to discover new hobbies and interests they might really enjoy. Evidently, this can help students to make new friends that share similar interests. This activity they might participate in could keep them active physically or mentally depending on what activity they wish to join. Every student is different with different interests, so they might not all like the options available. Students should look forward to what they enjoy doing in there child hood and carry those hobbies into there adult lives.

This is a great time for students to understand and follow there passions into the future where they can find career options and scholarships. These activities help students become more open minded about there future and over all make them better than ever in school and outside of school as well. Finding the right passion for each student is important so they know what they will strive for and where they believe there path leads into finding the best future they can have for themselves. Finding the right passion for the students is very important depending on which club they want and what the students want to learn in school as well.

Finally, all these ideas could help plant the goals they wish to achieve into their minds so they can work harder to achieve them and become more responsible with time, money, education, and work. Students have a wide variety of career paths and options to chose from, this is giving them a step in the right direction so they can see what they enjoy doing. More and more students will begin to work harder as they progress through school and enjoy what they like doing so they can strive for those goals they set for themselves. It also builds responsibility so they can learn to balance school and activity with a positive mindset.

Further more, students have many interest and will want a wide variety of clubs and activities to chose from. Although, some students may not want to participate in one of the activities available, make a suggestion to create an activity the student would enjoy so they can have fun and work for goals they set for the future.
