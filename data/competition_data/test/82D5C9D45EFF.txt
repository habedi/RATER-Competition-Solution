It's a once in a lifetime oppurtuninty. You can explore. You can lean. Not to mention you would be doing something for your country. So why not?

You dont get this anywere else. You can go expeirience things all over the world. Eat exotic foods. You can go to exploring all over the Earth, and learn about the places you go. Just like Luke from passage five. He went to China and Europe.

You are going to learn so much. You could rome around excavated castles like Luke in passage five. You would learn about other countries. Their goverment, economy, and lifestyle. Their past,present, and future. Could you imagine how fun that would be? Can you imagine all the good you would be for your country?

Unlike those people who sit at home doing nothing you could help out your country. Luke did this instead of going to battle. He states it in paragraph four,"When my draft board learned I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service." Not only are you helping your country but your also helping citizens of other countries all over the world. Which would make people look up to you. You would be a great American citizen. You will forever be remembered for doing a great deed. If you take a step back and look at what a chance this is. You will relize that you will want to take it.
