I do not agree with the principal's decision. All students should have their own choice if they want or don't want to stay after for the extracurricular activity. And what if a student can't stay after school because they have divorced parents and they need to go to their mom or dad's house the same day that the extracurricular activity is? Or what if the student can't go after school because they live far, or they have to take care of a relative when they get home?

If the principal is making students stay after school to do an extracurricular activity, and they have to change their whole schedule to fit around it, that's not right. I think the students should have a say if they want to or don't want to do the extracurricular activity.

I feel like the students should have a say weather or not to stay after for the extracurricular activity and I highly disagree with the principal's decision. Many kids have other things to do than just homework when they get home from school. Things such as sports, taking care of family members, jobs, and many other things that students do after school have to come into accord when thinking about this new decision. For example, students may want to spend time with family, and having to go after school to do an extracurricular activity that no one has a choice if they want to do it or not could be taking away from their time with family. And not all kids like sports, they may not be athletic. Or maybe they don't work well in groups in the student council, and when the student council walks around from class to class announcing upcoming events happening in school, they may not be good at talking to a group of people, such as those in a class. To add on to that, students may not be great photographers for the yearbook. There's always something that someone doesn't have a strong attribute in. The students should always have a say in what they want to and don't want to do, because it could be affecting their lives, and this should apply to this new decision that the principal has made.

I disagree with the principal's new decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, and I feel like the students should say weather they will participate or not. For example, students may have things to do after school that could prevent them from staying after and doing the extracurricular activity. Or maybe they aren't the most athletic person, and they don't want to participate in any kind or sport. Maybe the student is not good at public speech and doesn't want to serve on the student council. The student maybe be bad at taking pictures, so they may not want to work on the yearbook. If the principal is forcing students to do things that they may not like, or not be very good at, it could put them in a place where they feel forced to do something they don't want to do, and they can get angry. I feel like the principal's decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity is wrong, and students should say if they want to or don't want to participate in the extracurricular activity.
