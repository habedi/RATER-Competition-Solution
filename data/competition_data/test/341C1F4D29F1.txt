Dear Principal,

I am a student at your school pondering about should student should play sports if they have a B average well, i' m against that reason. Saying sports make some students better at school. One reason is that students that play sports manage their time better than people who do not play sports because, students who do play sports or have other after school activities have more on their plates than others, they have to practice, they have to have homework, and they maybe have to help their mothers with their baby brothers.

My second reason is that people who play sports have better grades for example people who do play sports the coaches support them at everything they even help them with their home work take it from me I have seen it myself the coaches even come to the class room to check up on their players not just their star players but every player!

Another reason is that people who never played sports our nervous they do not no what to expect but their team mates have their back every step of the way and encourage them to move on and don't quit or give up they help them move on.

Also talent scouts can help them get it into new colleges so they will not be on the streets, being in jail, or somewhere else who know' s what will happen to them. I have experienced good sportsmanship myself so

I conclude this letter saying i disagree. Thanks for listening have a nice day.
