This face is obviously a natural landform, I mean the sculpting & curves in the picture couldn't have been really focused on so a human/alien must not had have done it. There are also lots of different holes around the landform which means more have must have been formed close by the landform. Also im sure if there was someone or something on Mars when this happened NASA would have saw. The NASA also had said that "There was no alien monument after all." Which means that there must not had have been aliens on Mars after all. So the landform had to just be a natural landform. I honestly don't even think that aliens are even smart enough to know excatly how to prcocess this landform. The landform doesn't look done with any kind of tool or anything so therefore I think that yes the sculpture is a natural landform even though that's kind of weird & the article actually shows that as the years go by the landform starts to form even more. It also must have just formed because the article said that the NASA circled it so many times & this is the first time its actually found something.
