Phones and Driving

Many people can argue that using a phone in any capacity while driving should not be allowed. However, it can also be argued that it is useful because phones can come in handy if your car were to break down if you could use the "hands-free" options and when it is used as a tracking device. Many people can argue that using phones are unsafe while driving but that is not necessarily true. You need to make sure that you use your phone wisely while driving, use it correctly and for the right reasons. There are many situations where phones should be allowed when driving especially when it comes to your safety.

Firstly, a reason why using your phone while driving is that it could be useful to make calls if your car has a problem or if you are in danger. If I were to be in an unsafe situation like if my car were to break down, and I did not have my phone with me, I would not have had a way to notify someone and get help in time. I would have to ask a stranger to use their phone, which could in fact put me in more danger since I would be putting my life in someone else's hands.

There are many apps on your phone that can help you in any situation you may get into like, "Apps like iWrecked allow you to store and access all pertinent information, send a report, and access emergency resources with great ease and efficiency"(School). There is also a crash detecting ability that comes with the app Life 360 just in case of an accident, "Crash detection uses patented technology to detect major collisions. It relies on sensors in your phone, like your accelerometer and GPS, to detect a significant impact whenever the vehicle is moving over 25 mph"(life). A lot of apps now don't even require you to press or swipe at anything to use them while driving.

Also, with the new hands-free accessories available, there is less danger involved since you are able to be less distracted since you are paying more attention to the road. "Researchers analyzed accident and traffic citations for college students who claimed to use hands-free phones and those who used handheld devices in general. Both types of students were equally likely to wind up in car accidents. However, study participants with hands-free devices did receive fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than those with ordinary cell phones"(Housely).

You can use your phone as long as it doesn't interfere with your driving. "A hands-free mobile phone can minimize such issues, allowing drivers to make calls without ever taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the steering wheel"(Housely). Another reason why hands free is a good idea is because there is a way for people to utilise their mobiles without looking at it while driving. Not only are phones easier to use with hands-free options, but they also can help you before you even swipe it open.

If I am ever in the need to go meet someone in a place that I've never been and I do not have access to a phone, I will not have a tracking device on me in case I get lost or someone is trying to get a hold of me in case there is no service. Although the phone may not have service, the tracker will allow my family to know where I am. This tracker isn't just useful for me it is also useful for my parents to know exactly where I am. Now there are different apps and programs available on most phones that help with tracking such as Life 360 and Find My iPhone. In life 360 there is also some sort of detection, and it helps when you've been in any sort of accident. "Life360 crash detection is an automated service that knows when you've been in an accident, either as a driver or passenger, and asks if you're ok. If help is needed or you don't respond, life 360 will notify your circle members and emergency contacts on your behalf and share your exact location,"(life). This way they will have a location on me in case something happens. If you do not bring your phone, everyone would be searching for hours. In another instance, if I would not have access to a phone while I was being followed by someone, I would not be able to call the proper authorities to get help fast. On the apple website itself, it gives you brief information and you can install it, "Apple receives this location information only when you locate your device, turn on Lost Mode, or enable Send Last Location. Location data is only retained for 24 hours so we can display the last known location of your device. Find My iPhone also automatically turns on Activation Lock, which requires your Apple ID to be entered before anyone can erase or reactivate your device"(Apple).

In conclusion, there were examples of different situations as to why phones should be allowed while driving. In the first example I explained how a phone would be handy when there is a car emergency. I also talked about how using the phone while driving can become less distracting when there is a hands-free option. And for safety reasons, there is a way for anyone to be tracked, if you are in danger. The majority of people think that not using your phone while driving is a better idea for safety reasons. These are a few reasons why driving with a phone at any capacity would be a lot more beneficial.
