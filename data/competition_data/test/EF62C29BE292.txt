Dear Principle,

I believe that you should choose policy one. If kids can use there phone in a responsible way then i think they can be used during free periods. However if you notice that phones aren't being used at the right time or in the right way i think you should take away the phones.

The reason I strongly believe that kids should have there phones in school is because they could need them during the day, to get in touch with their parents. For example if an after school activity gets cancelled and at lunch they want to let their parents know about it they have a chance to contact them. Furthermore students have an opportunity to talk to kids as long as they are both in a free period. Lastly what if during a free period your mom or dad texts you and says "I cannot get you after school today and you'll need to get a ride home after school. "

That gives you a chance to text your neighbor or a friend and ask if they can bring you home instead of taking the bus.

Personally policy two isn't fair to me. If kids can't take there phones to school then it could cause problems after school. For example, if you are to go to your friends house after school and the school didn't allow you to have your phone on or with you then they might have gotten sick or for some reason couldn't have you over then there would be an issue.

I hope that you understand my reasonings and will vote for policy one. Thanks for listening to me.
