Extracurricular activities should be a choice not a rule. Students should be able to do these activities for fun. I know teachers will think this is fine, but no some of us need to study for tests. We don't want bad grades so we will get held back a grade, or get kicked out of honor classes

Students have a life outside of school, and don't want to do thing against their will. They want to play games and chat with their companions; something they don't want to do is not the solution. If that happens they will soon have more things to do on their hands. That is something that can cause stress. Which can lead to lack of sleep for upcoming test, or quizzes that are already to much handle with.

After school, students will get help after school from teachers with homework. Since Extracurricular activities might get added. They will have to do practices, instead of getting help with work. Students will have to try to figure it out in class without any clue.

Students sometimes will come late to class, or even miss a day of school. Then they would have to get notes from their classmates, or ask the teacher for notes. Now with these activities we have to do; we might miss classes because of them. Students will miss a big amount of information they needed for a test. Their might be a small amount of students in the class because most of them might be doing what activities you chose.

I know some teachers, or staff will disagree with me. Some will think that we are doing the activities that we like, but if it's something we had no choice for it's not fun anymore. Some students will disagree with me saying, "We do choose to do this, but if we don't are grades will drop." Nobody wants wants bad grades, which is why this is makes students feel like they have no choice.

We the students should have a choice to do activities for fun, and choice what we do with our free time. We should not be forced to do something we don't want to do. I hope this changes the principal's mind.
