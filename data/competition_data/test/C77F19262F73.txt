The author of this passage talks about exploring Venus, we all know its not a safe thing to do, the author knows that as well. It has been more than three decades since a spacecraft has landed on Venus, so this author wants to change that and land a spacecraft on Venus as soon as possibe.

On a personal note, I strongly believe that if I were to get a piece of paper and make a poll saying, "Do you think landing on venus is a good idea? Yes or No". I wouldn't be suprised if more people voted "No" than "Yes". You really have to look at it safety wise. You're putting yourself in danger by landing on the cloudiest planet in our solar system. You're landing on an 800 degree Fahrenheit planet. I get it, three decades is a long time and they want to change that and fly a person, or multiple people to Venus. But for safety purposes, i'd rather wait it out for another few decades.

In conclusion I think that they support this idea very well. The author gives a lot of information about Venus and the risks of going there.
