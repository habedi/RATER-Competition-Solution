Dear Principal,

I believe that Policy 1 would be a better policy for our particular school. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during lunch time, is a very well thought out plan.

I believe it would be better for the students, because then they would not be tempted to take them out during class. If you allow students to use them during lunch, they will not be as likely to use them during other periods. I think that if you didn't let students use their phones at all, then they would be upset and you would be more likely to get complaints from students, also.

Allowing them to use them only during lunch periods and other free time would make them more considerate with the time they have and appreciate it. I know that many students, including me sometimes need to call or text home for personal reasons, or too make sure that I have a ride home. Lunch time would be perfect for this! If you didn't have free time like this, then many people would be asking to go to the office, and call home.

Many adults may feel that Policy 2 is better, but considering that

I am an eight-grader, I feel different. I think it depends on your age and what position you are in to decide what policy is better.

Yet, I believe that Policy 1 would be better for our school in the reason's I listed above and many more. I understand others point of view's, but considering they would be tempted to take their cell phones out during lunch, anyway. I believe that you may as well, just let them have their phones out during the lunch periods, and off other than that. I believe both policy's would be acceptable, but in my position I would pick Policy 1 over Policy 2. I hope that I helped you in deciding which policy to choose. Thank you.
