Distance learning is a program that allows students to take classes at home rather than school. I believe that this is a very beneficial resource to the average student. Distance learning is beneficial to absents students, students struggling with mental health, and students struggling with specific classes.

Distance learning would help students that have to absent due to family issues, a doctor's appointment, etc. If they had the ability to take the class online, then they would not be behind other students in the class. It would also maintain the speed of the class rather than having to slow down at certain points to explain concepts that the absent student had missed. For example, I was absent from a math class on Thursday, so I used an online tool that the teacher provided to take notes and learn what was taught in class that day. This benefited me so I could continue taking notes from where the entire class left off. However, when I missed a day in my history class, I was not able to get the notes and I did not know what was going on.

This form of learning would also be beneficial to students struggling with mental health issues. If they had the opportunity to finish their work online, then they could avoid some triggers at school as well as bullies. Sometimes students may avoid going to school because of their current mental state. For instance, my friend, PROPER_NAME, struggled with depression and anxiety, so she ended up missing a lot of school. This caused her to fail most of her classes. She was bullied a lot and online classes would've helped her avoid those people.

Another benefit to the availability of online classes is extra help for students that struggle with a particular area of school. For example, If I was failing Calculus, then I could just watch the lectures from the online classes and complete some of the practices to help me learn the concepts. It would prepare me for classwork, quizzes, and tests that I would have flunked otherwise. Also, it doesn't require staying after school, so students wouldn't have to find a ride or worry about when the teacher is available.

Absent students would be able to stay on top of their work with distance learning. Students struggling with mental health could also work and avoid mean people. Also, students struggling in a class could receive more help with areas they are not doing well on. Distance based learning would be very beneficial and I support it.
