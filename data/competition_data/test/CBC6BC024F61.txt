I say no to community service

I say no to community service but we do need some one to clean it up. I think that is should be volunteer work for people who need extra credit. I think that it would be bad to do that because there is home work to do and if you don't get it done you get in trouble and get a bad grade.

But I think if you made us do community work there would be some people to do it. I am pretty sure OTHER_NAME

would do it and be over the club or whatever it is. The school would be a neater place to be for 180 days of the year.

IT would also be better for the environment if the school was cleaner . IT would look nicer all around the city of Charleston if some body cleaned up. sometime I see prisoners doing it and I just wonder what would happen if we let them do the whole state. I have traveled all over the state and I saw how dirty it was and I wish somebody would clean it up but not me.

The person that threw it there shouldn't have in the first place. If you get caught littering you should have to pay a fine of 1000 dollars. Littering is pathetic and dirty.

Sincerely,
