Dear Principle,

Hi

I am in the 8th grade at SCHOOL_NAME. I just had to come to you about the new school policy. I don't like the way you change it because its so unfair to the people who try there best in class , but just cant understand the work. Why not let the people who have a C average in their class participate in their school sports. But I can understand if they didn't try to do any work n make a C average. There should be a way that the people with a C average get a chance to participate in different things in there school. Here are something u can do talk to the teacher bout giving make up work. Staying for the after school program. Having Saturday school for 5hours. So there are lots of things you can do by help the C average people get there grades up if that's what u are real trying to do , but it has nothing to do with participate in sports or other activities. Children just want to do stuff with there life so that they can stay out of trouble and become successful to help their family . So I just want to tell u what i think about this new school policy. Hope u have a lovely and bless day.
