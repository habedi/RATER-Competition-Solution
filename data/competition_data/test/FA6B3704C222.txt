Mars is a wonderful planet with many chacteristics. One of these characteristics is the "Face on Mars" which was discovered in 1976. Different people have different opinions on it. Some people think it was made by an ancient civilization on mars well others say it is a martian mesa. Which is exactly what it is but some conspiracy theorists like to disagree. Although there is plenty of information to prove them wrong.

First, the original picture was taken in 1976 with a not so sharp camera. Later though in 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over and took a different picture and there was only a blur of a face with non-definant features. At that time people were anxious to see the picture and when they did they were disappointed. People started saying that it was winter and foggy so you couldn't see it. NASA disagreed but went along with what they said.

Next, three years later NASA went up yet again. It was a cloudless summer day in April. They were on the Mars Global Surveyor and captured the photo with the absoulute maximum resolution. With that time of camera you would be able to see a airplane on the ground or any type small shafts or Egyptian-style pyramids. That made most of the rumors end but there was still a few.

Finally there was a group of people who said NASA is hiding evidence from the community because they don't want us to know about it. That was a lie if NASA had found it they would want to tell the world. NASA space exploration fund would have gotten so much that they could study Mars for many more years to come. Some people at NASA were even hoping to find an ancient civilazation. In the end no one got what they wanted.

Therefore almost all the rumors were put to rest. Everyone now believed it was a mesa not a face. Although a face made by a far away ancient civilzation would have been cool to. Now a days people compare the mesa to a butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. So now they have a natural landform comparison.
