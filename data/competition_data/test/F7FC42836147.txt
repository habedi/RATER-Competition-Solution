Dear Principal,

"Hey STUDENT_NAME I'm texting STUDENT_NAME. Anyway what are we learning about?" Many students would text during class and not pay attention to their teachers or in class. I believe that most students will not be able to control themselves with this much freedom. I believe that students shouldn't be allowed to bring cell phones to school.

Many kids in school with text in class and not pay attention. So man kids would be want to text in class and they will. Then when the teachers asks them to answer a question they wouldn't know the answer since they weren't paying attention. These kids were too busy texting their friend across the room or where every their friend is. Another reason is that some kids never payed attention that they start failing their classes for not passing their tests or for not participating in class. Their grades will start going down and it affects them dearly such as going to summer school or even repeating the grade. Not only that but these kids would distract other kids from their education. For instance, one kid may text to another kid, and that kid might start texting back to who ever text him. Next thing you know, is that those two kids just lost one day of their education and is now having trouble with that subject the rest of the year. Cell phones in school is a distraction for kids.

I truly believe that students wouldn't have any control what so ever if they have cell phones in school. They would get distractive and distract other kids from their education. Not only that, but the students would start failing and their future won't be so bright anymore. That is why i believe we shouldn't have cell phones in school.

From your student,

STUDENT_NAME
