In Columbia, Germany, and Paris they are trying to limit the usage of cars in many ways so that they can improve the air and promote alternate transportation.

By reducing car usage like they did in paris where they made people with even numbered license plates leave there cars at home then the next day did the same thing to people with odd numbered licence plates. People who dident follow this rule were fined twenty-two euro's or thirty-one dollars. About 4,000 people did not folow the rule and got fined and about 27 of them got detained due to the reaction they gave when recieving the fine. By implementing this in Paris it brought down congresion by sixty percent after five days. This is a reason why car usage should be limited.

Germany is trying to. In a city called Vauban, cars are banned. You can own a car which you can park in one of two garages the town has on the outskirts but it cost 40,000 dollars so people tend to sell there car. In the town stores are built down the main road in walking distance due to the fact that there are no cars. This town is an experimental new district, on the outskirts of freiburg, close to the french and swiss borders. The town is totaly "Car-Free" if you dont count the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown freiburg runs. If this town spreads around the world and othere towns and cities implement the same idea we could lower pollution and better the enviorment. If we build everything closer there will be o nead for cars so thats another reason why we should limit car usage.

In columbia they implemented a car-free day where every one took buses, road bikes and other neat things to get from place to place. This program is wanted to spread to other countries. In the third straight year of implementing this idea they banned all cars on that day except buses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced a twenty-five dollar fine. Aside from the occasinal rain storms, this idea is a good way to "take away stress and lower air pollution." said ny businessman Carlos Arturo plaze as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. For the first time two othere columbian cities join the event. The cites are Cali and Valledupa. "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictios have dramatically ut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." This is all in result of that event. Quoted from sorce 3.

As you can see there are many was to reduce air pollution and promote alternate transporation. By taking away cars alternate transportation is needed to fulfil that tasks that need to be done throghout the day and without the exaust of so many cars going off the air pollution will go down too.
