My name is PROPER_NAME and i'am arguing about why I think driverless cars should not be built. My personal opinion is that people are the only thing that should be in control of a car so that there is not question on what happened if there was to be an accident. Is the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" it even states that these cars warn the person in the car whenever they might have to take over because te cars can't move around an accident or for any other reason. The reason the cars do this is because they don't have the technology to navigate themselves through a car accident, around a construction site, or if there is major traffic ahead. I believe that these cars are unsafe and will cause harm to people because of the lack of fully advanced technology.

There are a few positives about the car such as being much more efficient on gas. The vision of these cars is public transportation. The insite on the cars is that they will be much more efficient than the everyday taxis that are used for transport and will be much more flexible that bus transportation. The only thng is getting the advanced technology that we need to make the cars function safely without any risk of an accident of any kind.
