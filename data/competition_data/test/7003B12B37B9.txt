The cell phone policy at school should be fair to students and teacher's. By this i mean that students should be able to use there cell phones at appropriate times without disrupting other students.

I support the policy number two, because students can meet with other kids to maybe study in the library or go get a bite to eat by just simply sending a text message other then going out looking for them all over campus. The only thing is that each student would have to shut OFF his or her phone before they enter a building or else the phone will be confiscated by the teacher. This way there will be no distractions. The policy of number two is understanding, because students don't need there cell phones for emergency's because there's a phone in the class room that the teachers would be happy for you to use but sometimes students wont be in the classroom for an emergency then what's going to happen? Phones are a big distraction and should be just turned off till the end of school.
