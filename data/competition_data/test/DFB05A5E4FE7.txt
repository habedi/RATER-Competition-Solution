Well There is a lot to do in school, but some kids don't have time to do in school and outside activity , some Kids might do it because they like doing things and being active , and some other Kids might have bad grades and want to stay on them . perosonly I would do it to keep me happy and doing things then staying in the house and watching my phone or watching TV. I would do in school and like cheer, baseball, softball ,gave out yearbooks . but when

My grads Starts getting low I have fix them or I will have to stop doing the things I like to do .but like we can go outside .we can go to the park,we can go to the pool go with are cousin ,mom ,dad ,god mom ,anyone well you have to know Them , you just have to have fun and be you. and be positive .

I like doing cheer ,and it helps me be confident for who I am ,and help me start doing things. For me if I do things and keep myself moving , and i love going against people and in cheer . and the place we go is really fun and the team is like as family the stuck together in everything no one can brake them a part there for ever .but i love cheering its my life it will get hard somethings the head leader always on you if you mess up, they will make you do it over and over again until you get it right . that's like being in school if you don't do it right then they make you do it over and over again we all make mistakes but i love cheer in school it is fun love it.

When I was doing in school baseball and it help me stay on everything and had so good grades and i got all my anger out when I played baseball , and when i went home i feel so good because i didnt have no stress on me anyone that's why i love in school and out school activity ,there like my life to me and help me with everything the next thing i'm going for is girls softball,because i like hitting things it make me feel good in the inside of me . the resome why yes because some people dont know what others go thought ,they just assume them good and live a happy life . some people not saying all but some people do a activity ,because how people think they cant't do things like them, so they prove them self right to other but we as kids and grown ups we should 't have to prove are self to know .no at all we fight for are self they don't fight .for us we fight for are grades life to be good help are mom and dad and thing be have be you In joy life .

The resome why i would go to the after school ,is because i love doing things I would love for other kids to do it to try anytime its fun you in joy your self with people and other your age. and hahahaha they have food to food is what everyone like . but at the next of the day like have fun i like volleyball to its so fun let to hit people with the ball .ang go other places and be with your team . and just be a family the good and best part .

The main thing is people don't like staying after because they like going out and being with there friends going to the mall the movie and thats good to thats fun your hanging with your friends the fun parts in life for some of us not all but we all love having fun going out at night but school comes first before anything use that and your family and we all love are a family and friends in joy .
