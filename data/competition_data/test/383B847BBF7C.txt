Dear Principal,

If i saw my friends just sitting around i would tell them that helping out others in their community is very helpful and should do other community services.

Some people like to perform community services like helping out a pet shelter or just helping people on the street. Other people think that community survive is a waste of time and energy and i think that they should at least try it once to see if they like it. What i think about this topic is that all students should have to do at least two or three hours of community service a month or however often they would like. They should have to do this so they experience how other people live and to spread joy and love to other people then just yourself. Also, I think that community service would help kids learn more about respecting others and themselves. If you, the principal made us do community services i would be happy to help other people in their dally lifestyles. Also, in school I think that the teachers should do the community services with their class and other students that would like to join to help helpless people out. We should also be graded on this in school so more people would do this to help the community out. That is what I think about this topic and if people should help out their own community.
