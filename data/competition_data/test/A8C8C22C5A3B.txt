Dear Principal

The change to not allow students to be in sports or other activities should be made because if you have a grade C average then you already have enough on your plate as it is trying to stay above a grade D average, but then to throw a sport or an activity in to the mix! The sport will take up a lot of the students time that they should be working to get there grades up to A's and B's. If you are getting a C then that means that you need to work on those classes to get at least a B that way you have some lean way for your grade. if you were to get a bad grade on a test it wouldn't bring your grade down to a D or an F.

There should also be some lean way on the sports side to if you have a grade B average and your average drops to a C then they should give you some time to bring your grade back up with out completely kicking the kid out of the sport or activity. The coaches or teachers will also need to under stand that if they need to miss a practice because the student needs to get some homework done or they have an appointment then the student should be excused from that practice, but that doesn't mean they can use that excuse every time they just don't want to go.

Sincerely
