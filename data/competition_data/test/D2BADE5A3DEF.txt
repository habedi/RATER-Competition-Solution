Dear Principal,

Cell phones are a necessity for us. We need them in case something happens to us, we could call our parents right away or if we just want to keep in contact with our friends, but ye they should be turned off during school ours except during lunch. We should be able to use them during lunch and at free times, as we are doing now. If students are caught texting during class take their phone away, and punish them like calling their parents and letting them know that their student isn't obeying the policy.

Granted, there are a lot of students being caught using their cell phones when they're not supposed to, but the innocent students are obeying the policy and shouldn't be punished along with the other students. Cell phones are also a good way to get things around quickly. Like if there's going to be a test the next day and a student was absent, their friend could text them during lunch and the student could try their best to be there the next day. Cell phones are also a good way for you to contact the student if you need them. For example during a field trip, say the student can't be found. What do you do? You can call them on their cell phone and find them easily.

Cell phones can be a nuisance item, but they are helpful. Just make sure that the students disobeying your policy don't do it any longer; by calling their parents or taking away the phone and have their parent come get it. As you're doing now.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
