Their is a group of people called the Seagoing Coyboys, they are a very unique group of people who travel all over the world and experience alot of different things. One thing that they experience is what other people need and some places can inform you about many different things like animals and rare animals. Their also can be dangerious parts of this job allthough it sounds fun. You are taking a big risk traveling over seas alot and dealing with the weather and the ocean waves. There may also be a chance of taking care of animals like feeding them and caring for them to keep you bussy.

The Seagoing Cowboys is a very amazing job to have. People should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it will be very interesting depending on what type of person you are. If you are an explorer and you dont have any moey to travel if you get a job like this you will go places that you never even heard of before. Maybe you like going through rough weather like hard rain or 20mph wind for example. If you do like weather like that then this is the job for you because you travel over seas alot thats why the name of the group is called Seagoing Cowboys. Also when you turn 18 you will be old enough to join the military service. You can also have fun when your in the Seagoing Cowboys they play sports like baseball, tennis, basketball, and they also have reading clubs adn writing clubs.

I would join the Seagoing Cowboys if I could. Just think about it, why wouldnt you. Its a very unique group of people and they go on adventures and they have fun also what more could you ask for. There is one thing though, when you travel to far places it will take long periods of time like weeks.
