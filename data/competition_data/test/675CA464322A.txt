First of all, if technology at school would be able to do that the students would be more efficients in class. This technology allow the computer to scan how the student is feeling so this technology can help a lot because many students doens not pay attention cause they are not interested in the class or subject and here is where Facial Action Coding come in. In the text it say "A class room computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and it can modify the lesson just like a human instructor" This would make the leason even more interesting or in case you are confused it could make it more clear in a way you can undestand better.

Second, Facial Action coding can help people who are new to the language to give a teacher a clue of what is going on. Pleople who are new in the country who does not know the languague need a way to tell people what they need and Facial Computer Coding can be a really good tool for them to use for example if you are a ELL students and you do not speak English you can express what ou fell by the reading of your amotional expression. In the text I read " Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication". This is basicly saying that Facial Action Coding is a really good way for people who don't like to talk to express their selfs.
