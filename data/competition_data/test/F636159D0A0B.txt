I do agree that students should be in extracurricular activity,because they would enjoy them self with there friends,and they can help each other out ,when they need help learn how to play the sport if don't know how to play, and just have fun together with your friends in school.

The students would play sports and it well take place on a field every week ,it well keep student out of trouble because it well keep them active ,and help them be less stressful about the work and just have fun with the activity, the student's may be find new friends from the activity.

StudentsÂ dont participate and the activity if they don't want to participate, they can stay in class with the teacher and do something with the teacher or the can help set up the the activity,y but when its time to play they have to go back in the class with the teachers and other students.

In the activities the teachers can be there to help out like watching the student not to get in trouble during the time of the activity and help but setting the stands, for the extracurricular activity and just let them have fun.
