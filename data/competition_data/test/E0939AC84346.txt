Poisionsus car rides. Thier are many advantages to limited car use, polution, money and community. People should think about the affects of car emissions and help a new trend.

To begin with, cars have a big impact on polution and limmiting car usage would reduse gas emissions. It may not seem that much but shown in source one cars alone is responisble for 12% of polution in europe and  50% in the uninted states. Also its obviouse that private car ownership is increasing  because people see it as freedopm and thats a problem. Goverment is trying to densinin citys and areas so cars wont be such a nessesity. life without cars would be just fine a perfect example are the suberbs area of germany where practicaly no one has a car and they love it.

In addition, Money. Cars come with a lot of expencies and now they come with more. well lets see a couple tens of thousands of dollars for the car, insurance , gas thats causeing the problem and fes for people who dont want to make a change. In source two people where asked to limit driving and people who didnt where fined 31 dollars. people are so depend most people where in out rage and got thier car impounded. life is to reliant on cars for day to day activity and smaller citys are soffocating in smog.

Also, limmited car use could help communitys bond. With public transportantion closer ad local shopping areas instead of drving along a highway just to get to a mall. with a little help from public transportion i think it would impact a nations heath with unregognized excercise. simple walks for dady to day things and less polution is an over all benifit in conclusion, people should think about the affects of car emissions and help a new trend. The wortld is reliant on cars and don know the affect of them and polution is getting to major problem and we should limit our car use.
