Dear, Principal

We students have been hearing stories of you taking away sports unless we have a B average. I personally think it is a plausible idea, it will be a great way to pick up the student's grades and test scores. It also will encourage students into putting effort in their work. It shall help the school look better too.

It is a great idea it will further some students academically it should give students' s who need help more time to focus on their work. The students might study more so that they can pick their scores up to be one of the students playing and not having to worry about grades because they have it in the bag.

It will encourage students to put more effort into their work. If students see that all they need is to push a little more and they will make it, most of them will. If I was not making good grades by a mere couple points i would just try a little harder to at least say I tried. It is even better when you can say " I made it". Students don't like being stuck in classrooms all day so they will do anything to get out even working. If the only way to get out of class is to work it will be the fastest time you ever so a student strive and put effort in their work.

It will make the school look better. Once your counties superintendent an your board of directors get together and review the school it would get outstanding recognition. That is always good to have.

This is an overall good idea Isay you should go For i
