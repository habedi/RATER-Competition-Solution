What are the benefits of extracurricular activities? The principal decided to make all of the students to participate in an extracurricular class. I agree with the principal, I think that if all the students participate in that activity, they will get to socialize and learn how to be more collaborative with others.

Most students enjoy socializing but, if we have an extracurricular class, the students will have an increased amount of time to socialize with their friends. I like socializing with my friends but, during classes there is only a small amount of time to talk to each other. I think the extracurricular activity will give all the students more time to talk and chat. Socializing is a very important thing to do in life, it could make someone's day or even inspire someone just by talking to them. Some students might even get rid of stress by socializing. The extra class will make students be able to achieve these beneficial things, and they will have less stress than usual. I also think that when students socialize with their friends, they not only talk, but they learn something. I learned tons of things from my friends, they showed me how to solve some math problems and they told me what books are fun and is good to read. The extracurricular class can change tremendous amounts of things that are very beneficial to the students.

The extra activity can make students socialize more, but they can also make them be more collaborative. Collaborating is really important to the students, students will have to collaborate and work together even as adults. I think that if the students collaborate with other students there would be no problem collaborating when they are an adult. When students become adults, they will have to collaborate with others, and that's why the extra class is important. Some examples of collaborating is listening to other people's opinions, talking about what I think, and working together to finish a task. Some students might not like to work with other people, but they will have to in the future, so, I think that they should start to practice collaborating in the extracurricular class. I like collaborating with others, I listen to other people's opinions, I think about their opinions, and I tell them about my opinion. The extra activity will be a great place to collaborate. Collaborating can also make students respect others, when they listen to their fellow classmates or teammates, and not argue about other's decisions, that is an example of respecting others. If students learn how to respect others, other students and teachers will think good about that person, and I think that the extracurricular activity is a great impact to the students.

In my opinion, if all of the students participate in this activity, they will be able to achieve many things. There are many more tremendous things that will benefit the students, and there are still many things for a student to learn. The extracurricular activity will teach the students much more things that are needed in life as an adult.
