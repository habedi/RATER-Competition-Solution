Dear principal,

I agree with you that we should change the policy to maintaining a B average for being eligible for sports because, if someone has a C average they are just barely passing there classes. This could be a result in after school activities such as sports taking up to much time so that they cant do there homework and turn it in on time. Also a B average proves to not only the staff but to the parents of students participating in after school activities can maintain good grades while doing other things such as sports. Some students might find your reasoning a little bit harsh but, you know what they can deal with it because, if they don't maintain such grades other wise they will not continue on to the next grade with all there friends. Not only does this have a negative side but it also has a positive side. The positive side to this is that when they are not maintaining a B average is that they will have more time after school to finish there homework. Also they wont have to remember to pack there gear up and leaving something they need at practice. Instead they will be focusing more on there grades. so yes i do agree with your decision but, there is also a reason for me to disagree and that is that our students will not be getting there exercise in to keep them healthy. So if you do go threw with your decision than you should also increase the physical education to do more sporting activities and workouts. So yes i do very much indeed agree with you.
