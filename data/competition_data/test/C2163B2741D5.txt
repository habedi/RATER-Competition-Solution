The Seagoing Cowboy program is a program where you help people in destress who don't have food. This program is a great program helping people is what you do. Not only helping but somtimes you get to check out the place where you were sent so it is also like a vacation.

I think you or someone you know should join this program. I think it would be fun because in the text Luke Bomberger who was a former Sea Cowboy he got to go site seeing and check out some pretty cool places. One of those cool places is the Acropolis in Greece. Another reason you or a person you know should join is because in the text luke says that after you are done delivering the resources you get to play games and tournements on the boat. Also it is a good way to use time while on sea.

The Seagoing Cowboys are a huge help when there is a big crisis and the real thing that matters is that you are helping people out that is a good thing to remeber. Those are my reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program and you will not regret it.
