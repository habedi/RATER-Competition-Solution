The Introvert's Dream

The topic of staying home and receiving an education rather than going to school in person is one of great importance as of late. With the recent outbreak of Coronavirus, the flu like virus spread by air, there have been countless PSA's about staying home simply for your own safety. While this is reason enough to implement online schooling there are many others as well.

First and foremost, receiving an education at home could relieve a bit of that stress every high schooler faces just by stepping into this building. Some of us are scared to death by talking to people in person (myself included). Sometimes it's as simple as feeling uncomfortable in classes you don't have many friends in. Regardless of the problem, sitting on your couch at home with a laptop is bound to be more relaxing than squeezing into the tiny immovable desks in the barren white classrooms in the school.

Secondly, everyone learns differently, and being able to listen to the teacher without the constant din of uncontrollable high schoolers is a big advantage for auditory learners. Other people may be more visual learners, but have their vision locked behind a pay wall, may that be glasses or contacts. Sometimes despite paying for the privilege of sight you still can't see the board from the seat in the back corner you were assigned to. Most importantly if you can get together with classmates outside of class and talk something out without the teacher silencing your every peep, both students can benefit greatly.

On the other side of this coin, you could say that the option to completely avoid doing work would be detrimental, and you would be absolutely right. Honestly if I was given this sort of opportunity I wouldn't do half of whatever gets assigned to me. However, despite distraction and laziness, I feel some students could seriously benefit from a school system that doesn't require you go out and fit in with every social norm just to avoid being bullied by a kid with curly hair and a fake Gucci backpack.

In conclusion, implementing an online schooling option would be of great benefit to everyone involved. more kids get a learning style that better fits them, the school is less packed reducing stress of the kids who decided against the digital option, and teachers would most likely have an easier time controlling a smaller class size rather than the 20 to 30 most of them deal with currently. If you would think back to the opening point I made, you would find another very important reason to implement this new system. After all, less students in the building the harder it is for a virus to spread, and we know that even one prevented case helps the world as a whole.
