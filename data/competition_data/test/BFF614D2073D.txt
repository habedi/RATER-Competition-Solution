Do you ever want to participate in something, but you do not know what? Try an extracurricular activity! There are many positive benefits to participating in extracurricular activities. I think students should participate in at least one, if not more. Taking part in these activities can keep students away from technology, keep them mentally, and physically active and healthy, and help them become better people.

First, participating in outdoor activities can keep students away from technology. When they are not focusing on screens, they can go and enjoy the outdoors and get fresh air. Also, being outside students can help the environment, and be not polluting the air with technology. Technology can have a bad influence on people and can encourage students to make bad decisions. Staring at screens has many negative effects on people, so it is good for them to have different, positive things to focus on.

Second, staying physically, and mentally active will keep students healthy. When staying at home, people will usually choose to watch television, which is not good for the brain, especially in young students. Activities that involve physical activity will keep you fit, and keep you from becoming overweight. It is good for your mental health to think about positive and productive things. Staying busy with extracurricular activities is good for your mental, and physical health.

Lastly, being on a team, or interacting with others can help you become a better person. You can help someone when they are in need, or they are hurt. You can show others, and they can show you the right thing to do, and help each other not make bad decisions. When on a team, you can be nice to someone if they need a friend, or are getting bullied. When participating in an activity with others, you can learn how to be a better person.

In conclusion, if students join at least one extracurricular activity, our community will be a better place. They keep students away from technology, keep them healthy, and help them become better people.
