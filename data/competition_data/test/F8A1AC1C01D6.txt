Distance learning is either a choice or a options to many school. would it benefit? or are there other ways to attend classes differently? Some people believe that schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home while others believe other options would be a better choice for students to attend classes. This is important because distance learning is a better option for students to attend class from home. Distance learning is the best option for students because it would allow more time to do other things at home, secure the safety for the student, and having more comfort to stay at home.

First, distance learning is important to students because it would allow more time to do other things at home. Students would need to finish up many work to be done at home, so learning distance would be a useful option for students to have important things to do at home. An example, students with chores, part time jobs, and personal projects are essential to the students life at home, since most of their important focus are usually at home by their. So for students to do classes at home by online, it would benefit their lives being more easy to handle and have more free time to themselves. This would allow a student to finish their classwork and homework on time to be done, and moved on doing other subjects at home such as mowing the grass, cleaning the house, or finishing their part time job. Therefore, distance learning would be a best idea for students to work at home because it would allow more time to be done and complete many of their work at home.

Also, distance learning would be a best option for students because it would keep them secure and safe at home. Many students are afraid of going to school because they might either get hurt or catch a illness by any students. To illustrate, students may catch a sickness from another students, either by coughing or touching them by accidents. Many are usually getting sick that way because most never wash their hands or get check up by a doctor which is why students can be easily get an infection. Distance learning would prevent any students to be sick because it would handle the spreading by teaching their classes online rather than at school. The amount of students and teachers being sick would keep them and everyone safe from contracting a infection by not interacting them in social, but rather online where the teacher can be speaking from a distance, long communication. Some schools has use distance learning as a way to prevent anyone getting a infection during the corona virus spread. This would decrease the amount of infections in school to not declare a quarantine to happen in school because it would interrupt the class lesson and prevent any students to learn. Thus, distance learning would be a best option for students because it would keep the students more secure and safe from a pandemic to happen in school.

However, not everyone agree on this position. Some believe that a better options for students would be benefit to them because it would gain more reliable and comfort for them to work at this rate. Nevertheless, the individuals overlook a key idea that is distance learning which would provide the student to have comfort at home than school. An example, many students has always been more comfortable at home, whether it would be sleeping early or eating more of their own choices. This would make the students more easy to behave at home because it would relate to their environment at home more than at school which would also prevent any interruption in classes. Students with anxiety or disabilities would likely to be at home with a parent or guardian, since parents are a way to bring a sense of comfort and care to the students. For this reason, students would likely choose to use distance learning because staying at home would be more comfortable to them than at school which can give them a better way to listen and learn online.

With all this claim, one must conclude that distance learning is a better option to attend class at home. In other words, distance learning is a better option for students to attend class at home because it would allow more time for the student to do other things, giving security to the student safety, and making the student feel more comfortable at home. Distance learning would still benefit as the same idea for school, namely being the fact students can still be educated online with Google classroom being a better choice for them to work on homework and classwork more timely together. This would make the students and teachers more educated well than at school. Attended classes at home is a best way for anyone to choose distance learning in their path of a better future.
