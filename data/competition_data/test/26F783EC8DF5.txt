Dear principal,

I agree with this view, but I also disagree.

Many students would try to get a higher grade to be able to do activities, but some would just blow it off like everything else.

I would probably try harder to earn a chance to do special activities.

Many other students will most likely try harder for a few weeks but then just forget about it.

My agreeing point is that it would be a very suitable way to achieve a higher average.

A great number of students will achieve this goal if they truly love the activity like football, tennis, etc.

It may succeed and truly lift the spirits of students to achieve greater obstacles, and of course their favorite activity.

My disagreeing point however, is that many of the student body will think it's a dumb idea and most likely just ignore the proposal.

Lots of your students, as I'm sure you already know, don't believe they can do more than they do.

And many just think it's cool to look stupid, walking around with an F average.

Many people I know have more brains than they give themselves credit for.

If I walk up to one of my friends and ask them a quizzical question, most the time they know it but try to cover it up with some stupid remark.

All I'm saying is that it would be worth the try, but possibly a waste of your time.

It may be forgotten as soon as it's proposed.

It could also succeed and make school all the more worth while.

It could improve the school's average and just make it a happy year.

But it could also just doom the school's students to furthermore think of themselves as "I'm too dumb to do it, so I just won't."

Well, that's the reason your the principal and not me.

You are trained to make tough decisions like this.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,

Yours Truly,
