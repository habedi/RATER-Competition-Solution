Ever since their creation, cars have been the main method of transportation. However, in recent times cars have become less popular because of the issues that they cause. Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.

An advantage of limiting the use of cars is that they discourage physical activity. Reliance on a motorized vehicle for transportation from place to place results in little to no physical activity. Cars have replaced the use of bicycles, skateboards, and regular walking, their use seemingly reserved only for the youth. In a car free society such as Vaunban, Germany, the "swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children" can be heard by anyone walking down the street (Source 1). This clearly shows that when cars are used less,Â  people engage in more physical activity. This is the same case for Bogota, Columbia where the Day Without Cars is a big hit. Just in the third year of this event, over 118 miles of bicycle paths have been contructed in the city (Source 3). Limiting the use of cars is definetely advantageous because they discourage physical acticity.

Limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make polluation. The billions of vehicles in the world create unbelievable amounts of pollution. In Europe, "passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions" and "up to 50 percent... in the United States" (Source 1). The pollution from the increasing amounts of cars in compacted areas "are chocking cities" (Source 1). Nearly nothing else creates that much pollution. The only thing that cars are second to in the polluation rates are the monstrous power plants that continuously belch smoke into the atmosphere (Source 4). If the use of vehicles decreases, then "it will have beneficial impliciarions for carbon emissions and the environment" (Source 4). This evidence clearly supports that the use of vehicles is causing a huge amount of pollution. Thus, limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution.

Decreased use of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because the they cost everyone money. Expenses such as constant maintanance and fuel cost the average car owner a large chunk of their salary. In April 2013, the average miles driven per person was down by 9 percent, equivalent to the rate in January 1995 (Source 4). The most likely cause is that "cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars" (Source 4). The high cost of cars and their maintanace is a huge burden on the backs of the average vehicle owner. Not only does vehicles cost the individual person, but they have large effects on the government. In the six-year federal transportation bill, the cost of the highways was 80 percent, and only 20 percent was available to all other forms of transportation (Source 1). This issue has caused the legislators to get involved with the problem. Obviously, decreasing the amount of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because they cost everyone money.
