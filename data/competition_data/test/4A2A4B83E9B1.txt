Dear, Principal

I think that it is a good thing for the kids at the school to happy out in the community. even if they don't live in the community they still should happy out. if every school helps clean, re paint or even not litter it will make a big change for the world. this school can be a letter for other school. If there's less litter on the floor then the city doze not have to play some out to come and clean it up. And that person that's getting payed to clean all of it up is getting payed with tax player money that can be going for something more use full like better side walks or better things for the school. like Imac's in stead of using dells of hp. More better books.

community service should be a one time a week thing for the school. At the end of the day almost every one is doing nothing at all there just playing and talking when they could be talking and cleaning at the same time. If the younger students learn about cleaning and helping the community in a young age when they grow up there still going to be doing community service. We should all help around in the school as well. students that don't fell like helping should stay after school and clean the floor of every class room. If the hole school doze this then other school as well will follow use and at the end this hole state mint ever have to use tax player money to clean or help with anything. Thank you for tacking you time to ready this.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
