Dear, Principle

I highly suggest that students should do community services, For the following reasons. It gives the students a chance to make something out of them selves. Keeps the students from getting into formidable things stops kids from hanging with the wrong crowd. Makes them feel good about their selves. Keep them motivated, by requiring all of the students to do this the world will be a better place. By the students doing these community services it will also make a good name for the school. Help the students get in superb schools with high rankings. Even get students scholarships. You might want to keep this in mind with this community service idea not only would the world be better but the school. Everybody will know each other. From the shy kids to the popular students. Not only will the students want to get involved but the parents might come voluntary.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
