The principal should consider the grade B average suggestion. Students should be able to get good grades in all classes, students should be A or a B cause all students doesn't get good grades all the time. Students also doesn't always be good or better in any of the classes. In school dances, that should depend on their behavior. In school achievements should depend on their work. Sports should be about how their G.P.A is. How high is students is in all their classes. Students G.P.A. should be 2.50 or higher to attended in sports. Dances and other things should depend on their behavior and participates in school. Students should be able to get at least 1 suspension to be able to participate in dances.

Principal should require 1 suspension,2.50 G.P.A

or higher, and a good attitude with the fact that they have to have a good average in learning and at least 1 suspension in their record.

In all their achieve work should be reconsidered in their learning average for parents to see. Its always parents suggestions for the students to be able to apart of school's sports. Parents should be warned that their child must have a 2.50 in their G.P.A . Parents must also be warned that their child must have 1 suspension to participate in school dances, rallies, and other activities.

Thank you,
