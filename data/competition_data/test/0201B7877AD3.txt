i thnk is a good idea to attend classes from home online. Some of the reasons that students would benefits from this idea are that students will not have no excuces for not turning in work, projects, etc because there were not able to go to school. Another reason is that teachers dont have to be worry if that student is distracting other students from the class, some some of the estudents things that schoolis nit for them but if they could be at home and attending to school online less student would drop out of school each year. Other reason is that there are many students that gets bullying from other students, and most of the stuents that get bully decide to drop out of school because they do not feel confortable with it.

Each year many students gets bullying by other students and some of the teches do not do anything about it so many of the students decide to not to go to school but if school has the program to attendt to school online the student will mot have to drop out of schoolthey can just stay at home and still get class with out any other student bothering or bullying othe other students.

however if schools opends the online classes most of the student will not go to school because it will be easier for them to stay at home and do not have to wake up too early to go to the buss stop and decide what outfit are they wearig so i think that schools should openeds online clasess just for students that really needs it
