Why Schools should not Force Kids to do Extracurricular Activity

Most schools have something to do after school, like clubs, sports, or school performances.

That's great that they have them, kids can make friends, and they can do what they like, but what if your Principal forced each student including you to do and extracurricular activity at the school.

You might not be able to do it, or want to do it because, you might already have something after school to do that does not involve your school, you just don't want to do anything after school, and if it costs money your family might not be able to afford it.

This is why disagree, with the Principals stupid policy on everys student doing and extracurricular activity.

You play Football every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

So you do quite a bit of after school activities, but your Principal gives a e-mail to all parents.

From now on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved with the school.

Now your in a pickle, you can't do 2 things since you don't manage your time well.

Do you A join the schools crummy Football team, or B go against the Principal and stay with your Football team that is not involved with any school.

You choose B, and get in trouble for not choosing an extracurricular activity with the school.

Now doesn't this just sound stupid?

You get in trouble for not joining the school sports team.

This is 1 reason why schools should not force extracurricular activities onto students.

Everyone in you life calls you lazy, and it's true you don't want to do anything, and you defiantly don't want to do anything after school, but then your parents get an e-mail.

From now on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved with the school.

You think oh no I don't want to do this.

But your parents sign you up anyway for an after school Book Club.

You do not like their decision, and the schools choice to force kids into doing after school activities.

So you hatch a devious plan.

You know your parents get home a bit after you do when you are doing Book Club, so you just skip Book Club, and take the bus home.

Your parents get a phone call that you were not at Book Club.

You get punished by your parents, and by your Principal for skipping Book Club.

This example is a little far fetched but, some people just don't want to extracurricular activities.

Finally, what if your family is living paycheckÂ to paycheck, and you can't afford much, just basic necessities, and just maybe a little extra if it's a good week/month.

Since you guys don't have a computer the school gives you a note to take home, and it says.

From now on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved with the school.

You think yay this seems fun, oh and this too.

But with your luck each thing has a fee to join, since you do get something for the activity.

Since your on a tight budget, your parents say, "No, we can't afford this."

Oh well, the Principal will understand .

You think but you have Generic_Name from

Generic_Name as a Principal and he does not care that you don't have money and can't afford to do and extracurricular activity.

So he lets you choose a activity you want to do.

You choose an activity and then he says, "That's when you will have detention each day until the school year is over.

Each time this activity is going on you will have detention!" Then sends you out of his office.

This also sounds very stupid, giving a kid detention because their family can't afford to pay the fee?

These reasons, you might already have an extracurricular activity, don't want to do one, or can't afford it, show my opinion on this and how I disagree with the Principals idea of having each kid do an extracurricular idea.

But if you want to do extracurricular activities that is always good, especially if your school has a sport you enjoy or good clubs to help you make friends, and work with people that are interested in the same stuff that you are.
