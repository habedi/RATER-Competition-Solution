Using a car may seem helpful, but what if we limit car usage. There are many advantages in limiting car usage. Limiting car usage is becoming more common, and also reducing pollution.

Being a car free city can limit a lot of the pollution. "Automobiles are the linchipin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes." as stated in:

In Paris, after days of near-record pollution, a partial driving ban was set to clear the air of the global city. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate mattere per cubic meter, stated in:

"Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer. Cold nightws and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions, which created a smog over Paris.

Another reason for limiting car usage is because it is becoming more popular. As stated before, Vauban is a "car-free" suburb. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this was," said Heidrun Walter a media trainer in Vauban. In Bogota, Colombia; for the third straight year cars, have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, stated in:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky.

"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said the Bogota Mayor.

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal says: "...recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year go by." This indicates that a new era is coming. Limiting car use has already taken action because of the dangers of pollution, making limiting car more popular everywhere. Cities already participating, are an example to others of how useful this act can be.

Although limiting cars is already taking place, it is not worldwide. Only a few cities have begun to do it. There are advantages, seeing the cities that participate in a "car-free" society and realizing that the results are not bad should be a wake up call to others. After all, doing so helps save the planet a little more; and with a bit more help, limiting car usage will be worldwide.
