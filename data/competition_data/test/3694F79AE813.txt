The techonology to read people emotions of their faces is a good idea. If the technogoly was used in a classroom on a student to see if they were confused or bored, but what if the techonolgy didnt always work. A student could havea look on his or her face and the computer could read the wrong emotion of them. There is always that chance it could not work. Sometimes people can´t always tell is someone is smiling or not, maybe that could happen to the computer.

It might be usless in the classroom on students because Dr. huang said you cant wlays tell the full trait of happy. The computer might not be able to tell the whole trait of any emotion. It could tell you a emotion about your face maybe that you are feeling and could be completeing wrong. Some people might just have a blank experrsion on the face and have no emotion, or maybe they have a little emotion that the computer can´t see. There are 44 muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. Dr huang says this could modify lessons if the student is confused, but what if the machiene makes the lesson even more confsuing that what it really was.

The idea to read other people emotions is a good idea. It wouldnt be sucha good idea in the classroom with students. It would probably read the emotions wrong and try to help woth the lesson and make it more confusing. Therefore the computer that can read people emotion(FACS) should stay out of the classroom.
