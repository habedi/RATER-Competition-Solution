germany,paris,columbia and now the usa have begun to cut back ob their vehichle emmissions. why?

To reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced by their countries.

no cars in germany? vaubaun germany is a new upscale community on the edge of the french and swiss border. recently completed in 2006 whats so special you might ask?

theres little no no cars in this new community.

according to the article "

in german suburb, life goes on with out cars

" written by: elisabeth rosenthanl.

"70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."

thsi effort is being used to try and reduce the 12 pecent of green house gas prouced by europ alone.

in vauban people crowd the sidwalks, kis playing in the streets, and the people that do want to own a car have to pay a cool $40,000.00. and there cars are not even kept in their houses.

in another european country close by, paris is also trying to cut down its green house gas emisoms.

in the article "

paris bans driving due to smog

" it tells how france is also taking action to reduce its green house gases.

the article reads "after days of near-record pollution, paris enforces a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."

anyone who had an odd numberd tag on one of the days and was cought driving would  get a $31 ticket. and revers for the even numberd tags on the next day. so the cars took turns driving. meaning there would be less cars on the street on those certain days.

according to the article over 4,000 people were fined, and 27 people had their cars impounded. it might sound stupid but whe your trying to save the world its a small price to pay.
