Many car companies are working on driverless cars. There are many pros and cons of driverless cars. Driverless cars is a very debatable topic. Some believe they can change the world with these cars.

I believe that this idea is completely unnecessary. The money could be put to much better use than having driverless cars. In the 1950s GM created a car that ran on a special test track. The track had special roads that worked with special cars. To make this work they would have to upgrade roads. Though the idea worked well, the idea was too expensive to fund.

The driver assists, like special breaks and motion sensors are a good idea, but not driveless cars. Some pros of having driverless cars are, people wouldn't have to pay attention to the road and do what they want while in the car. Sure it would make life easier. Think about when a teenager first gets their license. Most don't know their way around everywhere. With a regular car, I think it would be better for them to drive around and get familiar with their environment. If they had a driverless car, they wouldn't really pay attention to where they're going. So if the car was to malfunction, they wouldn't know where they're going. Also if an accident were to occur, it would be hard to tell who is at fault.

I think driverless cars are a bad idea, because they're unnecessary. It will be another product for rich people. Also i think it will be a safely hazard.
