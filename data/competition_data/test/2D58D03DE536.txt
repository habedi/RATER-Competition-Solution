I disagree with the principal. Changing the school policy so that you need a grade B average would get rid of many of the athletes that were currently playing sports. It would also make students feel bad about themselves.

People who enjoy sports and play them a lot and want a career in sports need a lot of time to train for their potential success. This would limit the time to focus on academics, but since they want a sports career, they wouldn't need it as much as other jobs.

And since a grade C average is passing, it wouldn't be fair to need a grade B average to play sports.

Athletes with a grade average below B would feel like all their training was for nothing.

Students who play sports just for fun would get really bored because they are not allowed to play one of their hobbies. Sports give people a lot of motivation, so they would be able to get good grades and play sports.
