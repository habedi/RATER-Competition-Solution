Is it ok for some students to work frome home threw long distancs learnig. I believe long distance learnig is fine in high school and esspecially for kids with oerformance and anxiety and very bad alergies and cant leave the house much. There arre many reason why most kids cant go to public schoolss whether its money,allergies, or just being very sick. If students are able to acces school work and lessons from the comfort of there homes if need be it would be benificial for them. Doing school work at home does have its flaws, you could get easily distracted with wats around you and since a teacher is not there they can not get and extra information that they need.

There are many different types of long distance learning. There is home schooling where the student stays at his home and does all his or her computer or divise. Then theres video chats where you can sit in on a public lecture on call on a devise to recieve all the information you need. Third is a private tutor an individual who either comes to you directly or through a video chat and teaches you what you or your parents have paid hime to teach. These ways of learning without having to go to school could also cost alot and may have many set backs. For one many who work from home dont finish there work on time and get distracted easily. There is also the paid aspect if you dont pay a subscription or fee on time the lessons or tutoring could stop at any moment.
