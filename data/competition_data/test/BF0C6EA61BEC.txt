Man, I enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy. I got to help so many people! You should sign up! The purpose of Seagoing Cowboys was to help countries that have suffered from WW2, such as Greece and China. It was created by UNRRA, and was very helpful to all critical European countries.

A few reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because we bring horses, cows, and muless to countries in need and we also take care of these animals. You also have some time for sightseeing. However, there is some danger of signing up. Seeing as you´re on a boat most of the time with hundreds of animals, you have limited space, and then you have the dangers of the sea. When I say dangers of the sea I mean things like drowning, storms, et cetera.

Now, I want to tell you about how I got into Seagoing Cowboys, and my story of being one. It was 1945. I had two part-time jobs at the time, and my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to join him in going to Europe on a cattle boat. World War 2 had just finished, and lots of European countries were in a critical state. 44 nations joined to make the UNRRA, and they hired people to take care of cattle that were being shipped. Don and I both signed up.

In August, we were told to go to New Orleans for our job. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, a cattle boat with more than 300 horses. I was discharged in 1947, and I had made history. I made 9 trips, which is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It was impressive, seeing as I couldn´t work for a few days due to broken ribs. I was so proud of myself, and it was definitely more than a job, it was a way to help me be more aware of others´ needs.

Well, I have to go back to my job at the supermarket. I recently was rehired and got my position back in the meat department. Now, isn that ironic? Remember, if you have the chance to be a Seagoing Cowboy, take it! It´ll open up so many parts of the world to you.
