Dear principal,

I believe you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as their phones are off in class. Its a good idea because that way there be less phones taken away and you don't have to bother calling parents to come to school and pick up phones. Also it a good idea because that way your student don't have to be sneaking around with there phone because some student argue when they take there phone away. So policy 1 its a better solution than the other one . Plus us kids don't have nothing to do during our free so we just could text friend our parents telling them when they feel sick or something. In class they will not abuse it because they know they can use it later on in lunch or when they have there free time. And if you take phones completely off students will be very upset and will not pay attention in class get caught with there phones out .

sincerely,
