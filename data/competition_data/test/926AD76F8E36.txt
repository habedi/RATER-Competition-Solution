Summer vacation is a time of rest, relaxation, and recreation for public school students across the nation. However, this break is also well-known for creating significant academic setbacks for these students and causing them to struggle in their return to school. To solve this common issue, many schools have started to require their students to complete a summer project in order to maintain their academics outside of school. Although these projects would be more educationally beneficial for the students if constructed by the teachers, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to do a high-quality project are increased.

To begin with, the summer break projects should be constructed by the students because they are more likely to enjoy the project. In today's society, many students enjoy creating things that they thought of themselves and were not assigned by a teacher or parent. Consequently, if these projects were created by teachers, the students would say that the topic that the teachers selected for the project was not interesting enough and would not be as motivated to complete the assignment. If these projects were created by the students, they would not feel forced to do the project. Instead, they would leave for summer vacation already anticipating starting this fun and exciting new activity. In conclusion, schools should allow students to create their own summer project because the students are more likely to enjoy it.

In addition, the allowance of a student-constructed summer project would increase the probability of completion by the students. If the students are permitted to complete a project of their own invention, their motivation to do it will increase because they are guaranteed to enjoy the topic of the project. Teacher-constructed projects are not likely to suit the interests of each of their students. This results in a percentage of the students not enjoying the topic of the project, losing motivation to do what was assigned, and eventually not completing the project at all. This can be avoided if the topic of the summer project was student-selected because each student would be doing something that they are interested in. To conclude, students should be allowed to select their own summer project instead of the teachers selecting it because their motivation to complete the project is guaranteed to increase significantly.

Finally, schools should permit students to pick their own summer project because the chance that students will construct a project of higher quality will increase. Students completing a project that they are interested in are proven to spend more time and effort on their assignment. Forcing students to construct a project that they are not interested in is the easiest way to receive a low-quality project. In order to prevent students from creating an unambitious and lazily-made project, schools should permit students to choose what project they will be doing. This ensures that every student is doing something that they will be guaranteed to enjoy. To summarize, the allowance of student-constructed projects increases the probability that schools will receive high-quality projects on their return.

In conclusion, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to complete a high-quality project are increased. The projects mandated by these schools will create a new generation of inquisitive and ambitious students. The students who complete these interactive and enjoyable projects are more probable to enjoy school on their return and have an increase in motivation and ambition regarding their academics. Allowing the students to construct these summer break projects instead of the teachers is the best possible decision that America's schools could ever make for the future generations of today's society.
