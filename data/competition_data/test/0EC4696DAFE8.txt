The develoment of driverless cars should not happen. Most cars that are driverless are not truly diverless, they cannot handle many of the tasks, and they still require a person to be ready to take over when needed.

Most developed driverless cars are not truly driverless. According to the article they still need the driver to be alert. The article says, "they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues." This proves that driverless cars are not driverless at all. They still need the driver to be alert at all times. The article also points out that all the cars that have been made are not completly driverless. The article says," In fact none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless." Most driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but, they still need a driver.

Driverless cars are not really much safer. These cars cannot handle many of the road tasks on there own. They cannot navigate through roadwork or accidents. The google car can drive independently but under specific tasks. There are senors that can make driverless cars much safer but they require the driver to have hands on the wheel at all times. The article also says, " traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."

Because of this in most states it is illegal to test these type of cars.

Even if driverless cars are being developed the still need a driver behind the wheel. All cars that have been developed still need a driver to be ready and alert to take over the car when the car cannot handle a specific task. The article states that the human driver must remain alert and be ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs.

Further development of driverless cars should not happen. Most of the are not really driverless, they are not that safe, and they will always need a driver to be alert at all times. A truly driverless cars will need more improvements and will take more time to develop.
