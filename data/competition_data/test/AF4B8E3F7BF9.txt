Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to personally talk to you about the phone policies that you wanted to make.

I personally feel we should be able to bring our phones to school.

I personally feel that having our phones during lunch periods and other free times would only be appropriate because what if we have been injured at school with no one around you to help. We could just take out our cell phone and call for help.

We also would use our cell phones for family purposes for example if a family member is in the hospital, we as a student would get the memo quick, and be able to reply to the memo.

Also we be able to use our phones to see who was going to pick us up or if our parent were on the way to pick us up or if we were going to go home with friends we could call to let our parents know.

We would not abuse the policy if you made policy one our new policy.

I hope you consider may these explanations about the cell phone policy that you are reconcidering.

Thank you,

STUDENT_NAME
