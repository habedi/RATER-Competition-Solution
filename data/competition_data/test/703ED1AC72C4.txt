Dear Principal,

I do not like the idea of not being able to play sports without a B average. A lot of kids in our school have a C average. That would shorten the sports teams a lot and risk our chances of winning. Also, if kids aren't active it could cause health issues. Kids and teens now a days are not getting enough exercise.

Sports are what gives them the most of it. By taking away sports from people with anything lower than a B average, could be harming kids. If they don't have things to do out of school, studies show that they will turn to bad habits, like drugs or gangs. Another point, some kids have learning disabilities, and that could disable them from getting A or B averages, and they could be trying there hardest. Taking away sports from them could make them feel bad about themselves, and feel like they aren't good enough. Social reasons is another reasons sports shouldn't be taken away. A lot of friendships are formed on sports teams. Having friends is important in school. If one friend can play and the other can't, there friendship could go away because they don't have things in common anymore. Overall, sports are an important part of a kids life. Taking them away for having lower that a B average would be a bad idea. Please take what I'm saying to note. Thank you.
