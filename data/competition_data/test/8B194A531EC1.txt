Imagine being able to travel the world and discover true passions while still being able to attend class. While exploring and finding a career, an education is still benefiting the future of the student. This option for pupils is becoming more popular for youth, it is distance learning. Distance learning allows for students to stay home or to explore the world while receiving an education. These pupils can choose classes that interest them and can easily complete them online. Although others may believe having classes at school should be the only option so students can improve social skills, distance learning is the best option because it allows students to travel, go at their own pace, and not have to worry about transportation to attend class.

To begin with, young adults are discovering their identity and true passions while still receiving an education. Many students love traveling and having real world experience while still having a classroom education. For example, pupils learn about different cultures and languages in the real world, but know the basic core subjects taught in classrooms. This option prepares kids for the future by exposing them to diversity, improving their social skills, and allowing them to explore new places. Allowing the pupils to travel lets them have experience and stories to share to future generations. On another note, many students are on their way to becoming professional athletes and are commonly traveling to international competitions. Online schooling lets the child to be active and start a career while improving knowledge through online classes. Others do not realize that these kids are on the road to their future early and need to travel to begin their career. As well, military families are often moving from place to place, starting over every time they move. The children in these families often have to restart social lives several times and are confused on how to complete classes. Distance learning makes moving much easier and the student does not have to start again and possibly lose credits from school to school. These pupils can better use their opportunity to travel while using distance learning to receive an education.

To add, many students often feel overwhelmed and their classes are paced too fast for them to keep up. If distance learning is provided, the student will have more time to fully comprehend the material and be ready for the next exam. For instance, having classes paced to the student's needs decreases teen stress and anxiety. Stress and anxiety are rapidly increasing disorders in teenagers. According to teens, school is one of the leading causes for their mental disorders. Classes do not stop for students, they proceed even if they do not fully understand the material. Online schooling allows for kids to choose their class times and go at their own pace in order to learn their material. Also, grades would increase dramatically, allowing for students to pass their classes and earn their diploma. Classes would benefit the students by allowing a slower pace and for the pupils to take their time.

Furthermore, families often have difficulty transporting their children to school. Distance learning omits this problem and also allows for kids not to have to ride the bus daily. For example, families would not have to worry as much if the guardians of the child have to go to work early and stay late to provide for them. Many students have to find a ride with a friend or ride the bus every day which is quite inconvenient. If the family does not have a car or a form of transportation for the student, there is no problem getting the child to class. On the other hand, less use of cars and buses decrease the carbon footprint. The environment is benefited and less toxins are released into the air. The environment is being destroyed daily and having less automobiles used would help everyone. Transportation becomes less of a problem and the environment is benefited if online schooling is provided.

In conclusion, distance learning would benefit the young adults who need to travel, decrease stress by allowing a slower class pace, and decrease transportation issues. This option is quite important because teens are finding their identity and future career at this point in life. If online schooling is provided, traveling families would have much less difficulty and the carbon footprint would decrease dramatically. Distance learning should be the future of schooling so students can discover themselves while receiving an education.
