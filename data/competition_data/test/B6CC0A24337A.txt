Unmasking the Face on Mars is a good way to figure out how and why the face is there. People think it was a type of form of aliens but it wasn't it was put there for attention on the planet mars. NASA wants to hide the fact that they came up with the whole idea of putting attention on mars,and making the whole "research" fake and all a lie.

The face is a natural landform because it was there to draw attention to mars which it did. "The author's reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars which it certainly did". The face on Mars became a pop up icon. It starred in hollywood films, books,magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines. Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

That's how the face and why the face showed up on mars. It was not any form of aliens. NASA wanted to bring attention to the planet mars,which they did by saying that the face was form of aliens. There was no type of aliens involved, but attention from public was given and all eyes was on NASA and the planet Mars. NASA tried to hide it and it seem as if it didn't work.
