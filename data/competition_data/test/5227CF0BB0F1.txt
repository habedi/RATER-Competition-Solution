[M]Luck point of the view convincing others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.[A]The texts states that In August 1945 they received their orders to report to New Orleans. When my draft board leaned that I was on a cattle boat trip they told me to keep doing that for my service. Luck made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboys. The cattle boat trips were an unbelieve opportunity for a smalltown boy. Helping people I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china.[A] It took about two weeks to cross the Altantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as boy had prepared Luck for hard work but not for the dangers at sea. Luck made another trip to night watchman. He had to check all the animals at night. Luck also found time to have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luck Bomberger. It opened up the world. He leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.[M] This proves how Luck point of view convincing others to be a Seagoing Cowboys program.
