Are beeping horns accidents part of today's dreams for the future? Techology corporations such as Google and car companies dream of dangerous, driverless cars as a normal neccesity in the future transportation. However, there are many issues with the autonomous public transportation these companies dream of. The most important being; driverless cars are too dangerous for practical use.

While it is true that driverless cars may become a convenience, they may also be impractical for use in many dangrouse road conditions. The development of such cars show the have complications when, "dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork and accidents" (Unknown). With navigational issues like these, driverless cars should not be on public roadways.

Of course drivers could manouver these conditions manually, but if they are distracted maynot notice the alerts to take the wheel. In fact, distractions are another major issue with driverless cars. Driving laws require a full attention to the road. However, drivers may, "get bored waiting on thier turn to drive" (Unknown). If the driver is bored, then they may take their eyes off of the road or even drift off to sleep. When the time comes to take the wheel, they may not be prepared and accidents will happen.

The autonomous cars drempt by many corporations are not just dangerous for the owners of these machines, but other drivers as well. If an owner of a driverless car becomes distracted, other drivers will have to take action to avoid the misshaps of the automonous vehicle. More accidents could very well happen as a consecence of avoiding an accident. Attempting to avoid an accident may also cause not just one, but many as a result of a pile up.

The problems with these cars are very clear. While they may be fun toys for the rich, they should not be put on public streets. The dangers outweigh the convenience. These machines are just not safe enough for the public and should not be sold.
