Have you ever considered participating in an extracurricular activity? I'm sure there are many students who have considered joining an extracurricular activity, but have never been given the opportunity. Extracurricular activities can be a source of friendships, entertainment, college opportunity, healthy coping, opportunity, and even prevention of drug and alcohol use. Now our principal has decided to to make extracurricular activities mandatory. So now you have to pick the extracurricular activity to join, There are many opportunity such as the yearbook club, sports, and the student council. I believe that extracurricular activities should be mandatory for students in public school do to the mass amount of opportunity they provide.

Enrolling in extracurricular can improve your chances of getting in to a good school in college. Colleges aren't just looking at grades, they are also looking at what your interests are. Due to the recent boost in competetion among colleges the aren't just looking for the smartest people, they are also looking for people who are athletically inclined or if you were one of the lead members of the debate team in high school. Extracurricular activities give the students entertainment or a distraction from there home life and school work for a few hours. Some students may not have anything to do at home or might live with and abusive family member, and the student gets a break from that. On top of that the student would also be engaging in a better social life and may be able to open up to others about there home life. This generation is known as "the most depressed generation.", or "the most suicidal generation.", although it is true that the depression and suicide rate have been shown to go up in this generation i think extracurricular activities can assist that. Extracurricular activities can be a distraction or as people in the physch like to call it a "Healthy coping method.", this shows that since an extracurricular activities can be used as a means of distraction it can help prevent self harm and depression, and students will be more open with others and can maybe share there problems. Sports and exercise release the same endorphins that are released when someone cuts them self so obviously exercise is the better solution We have already have been of over that extracurricular activities can be used as a healthy coping method, it can not just prevent self harm, but also drug and alcohol usage. A lot of highschoolers end up doing drugs and alcohol at some point in there high school career which could lead to further usage as an adult. Some highschoolers use these as entertainment or a coping method, but since they have the extracurricular activities at hand they don't need to use this as unhealthy coping or entertainment. Joining the student council will give you the opportunity to make change in your school.

Colleges are looking for students who participate in extracurricular activities. Participating in an extracurricular activity can reduce the rate of alcohol and drug usage. Participating in extracurricular activities can lead to friendships and bonds made in and out of school that will last forever. Participating in extracurricular activities can reduce the depression and suicide rate in schools. Extracurricular activities give the students the opportunities to make a difference in their lives.
