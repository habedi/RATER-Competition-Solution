Should people who are operating a automobile be able to use any technology while driving?

I believe that all phones should be put away while in an operating mobile. Most accidents are caused because of cellphone usage while driving. Mainly, because their attention is on other things, and it causes car insurance rates to rise. Besides that, protecting pedestrians and other motorists should be more important than a cell phone.

These days accidents are mostly caused by cell phones usage while operating a vehicle. Statistics show that one out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused from cell phone usage while driving (edgarsnyder. com). You can admit, it is hard to keep focus on the road when a phone is present. It is believed that phones shouldn't be in use while driving a vehicle. It is very dangerous for you and everyone else around you. There is always a chance of danger and with distraction from your phone there is a higher chance for an accident.

Secondly, when driving and using technology, usually your mind wonders off into another state. Driving with distractions from a noisey cellphone is kind of like driving under the influence of drugs. It's just too much going on at one time which could also cause an accident.

When the light turns greens and you're on your phone, what do you think happens? Traffic accidents. Or what about when you and someone else are waiting at a stop sign and you're busy on your cell phone and "boom" you hit them? There was a possibility you could have ended their life. That phone call or text message could've been responded to when you got to your destination. Am I right? Now a days, most people are afraid of traveling on the road because one they are afraid they may get hit, two they might hit someone, or three there's traffic somewhere. My mother won't even let me drive because she's hearing so many stories on how teens are losing their lives because of their cellphones. Would you want to let your child drive on a dangerous road knowing that there are people not paying attention to the road? No I don't think so.

Also, insurance rates are rising throughout the nation, so many accidents are around and typically they are because of a phone. There are many ways of causing an accident but "Driver error is most often the result of "distracted driving." By far the most common cause of driver distraction is the use of cell phones" according to Dr. Daniel Landers. But why is a phone more important than your safety? It shouldn't be. There are now many states in the United States with the "hands free" law to prevent people from using cellphones while operating the vehicle and so far, there have been less accidents involving phone usage.

In conclusion, laws have been enacted to protect all citizens from distracted drivers.

Specifically drivers who use their cellphones responsibly with hands free devices ensures that all citizens get to their destination safer than when these laws weren't in effect. As a result, drivers can expect decreased insurance costs in the future.
