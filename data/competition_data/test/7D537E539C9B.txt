There are many things that students do after school like play sports or video games. students need to get out in the community by do things that could help.

one of the things that could be done is improving peoples life's like going to soup kitchens and severing food to the people that are less fortunate. one time when i was 10 on Christmas my mother and father took my brother and I to a soup kitchen. when we got there were so many people there that didn't have food that they could give to there family's. one lady hade 5 little boys alone she couldn't get all the boys food that they need so i gave her the food that the soup kitchen was giving me for working there she was very thankful for what she had that it made me think more about helping people. Another time when i went to the homeless shelter was when i was 13 and we were caring food that was donated to give out to the people and this old lady came up to me and asked if she could have some food as we were caring it in and i said yes so we brought her in and gave her some food and she started taking about how she became homeless and it really touched home on what she was saying to me. it made think back to all the times that i have hade it easy and how i took it for granted.

One of the most important things we could do probably is go to special needs places like give Kids The World this organization gives kids that have illnesses that are going to kill them the chance to go to Disney world and do all these things before they are going to die with there family they stay there for a week and have time with them and then they leave. the reason i think this will be a great place to go for kids is because it will make them see how much they will love there life's. another thing to is that they will be working i n places that will teach them how to deal with special needs people. that's some of the reasons why i think that comminute sevice will help kids learn.
