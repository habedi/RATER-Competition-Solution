In school learning is declining more and more every year. With new technology more schools are adding programs where people can learn from home. I believe students would benefit from attending classes at home because students would be able to learn at there own pace, provide more rest, and give students more time to do another task.

Attending classes at home would let students learn at there own pace. Some students feel that the in school learning an be rushed or not fast enough. From experience, i would choose attending classes at home instead of in school. If someone is slower in certain subject, they can learn it at a pace that they would be able to retain and remember the information. While in school classes rush to get in two units in 3 weeks, attending classes at home would give students the liberty to take there time and not feel rushed to finish. Feeling rushed has been proven to produce worse work than when your not rushed.

Students are commonly tired when they first show up to school. They are woken up at the crack of dawn to leave when the sun is just coming up to go straight to learning. The brain can struggle to process and retain information when it is tired. Students would be bale to get more rest when they attend at home classes. They wouldnt have to wake up at 5 am just to go straight to working. They wouldnt have to stay upÂ all night working on homework. The could get a good nights rest and wake up awake and not have to worry about go straight to doing school work.

Attending classes at home would give students more time to complete other important tasks that they couldnt complete when taking in school classes. Many students have jobs, out of school sports teams, and sometimes a kid. Taking at home classes would give students more time to make more money for weather it be college, car payments, and new technology. It would also give them a chance to still play on that sports team theyve always dreamed of or train to make a college team and still go to school.

In conclusion, attending at home classes are a good thing. They help many and give more benefits than in school learning. Many students believe this and so do some parents. Technology is the future and it is a global epidemic. More rest, learning at there own pace, and more time in there day are all benefits of at home classes and will be the reasons more students will try them.
