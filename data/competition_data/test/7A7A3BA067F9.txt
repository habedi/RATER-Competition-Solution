Dear Principle,

I think that you should not make community service a requirement. You already made school a requirement, so you shouldn't make community service a requirement also.

And you can't make us do community service. Yes we should do community service on our own already, but if someone doesn't want to, they shouldn't be forced to.

If you do decide to do something involving community service you should make it an after school activity that kids can volunteer to do. So it would be like the: cooking class, guitar class, or something like they already have but it would be to help the environment instead of cooking or playing the guitar. I bet that if you did make an environment friendly class there would be kids who would want to join and then more and more kids would follow and be encouraged to join the after school activity and become better to the environment.

I do think that if you do make and environment friendly after school activity that we could probably raise money that could go to the school to help on supplies and stuff like that. If we couldn't do that then you shouldn't make environmental friendly anything not a requirement either because of the reasons listed above.

Thank You for taking the time to read this letter. And hopefully you take it to consideration. I also think that if you do not take it to consideration you could also just help to encourage kids to do it on there own and that it's not a waste of time and would be very helpful to the environment and everyone in it.
