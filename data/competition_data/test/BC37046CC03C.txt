If teachers set guidelines and standards for how they want their students projects to look, then their students would put more effort and energy into fulfilling those standards and guidelines. Student would be more efficient in order to accomplish what the project should be and what the project should actually look like to the teacher.

However to some students it may be better to design a project based off of how they would want the project to look and how they want their project setup instead of what teacher would want. This would give the teacher the opportunity to see what the student is capable of doing on their own. This option would represent what the students have actually learned over their break. It also will reflect how the students take it upon themselves to show what they know in a creative way based off of the projects topic.

However, student-designed projects would lead to some students not putting as much effort and creativity in their projects. Students will do the bare-minimum when they have the option to take it upon themselves to do an assignment for school. Some students may take it upon themselves to go above and beyond for their student-designed project. However some students may take advantage and use it as an opportunity to be lazy and unproductive on this assignment.

Students would not have as much motivation if they have the option to take it upon themselves to create a project over their summer break. If this assignment was left up to students to design their own projects some would not take it as serious as should and some would. The students who won't take it as serious as they should would have an unorganized project or they just wouldn't do the project at all.

A benefit of summer projects being teacher-designed would be the fact that all students had one layout or structure for how their projects are supposed to be. It would be easier for the teachers to grade and look over all projects efficiently. It would also be easier for the students to follow an assigned rubric or setup for a project. Instead of designing it on their own

Teacher-designed project would be easier for students because they know what the teacher expects their project to be like in order to get a good grade on it. This will make the students projects way more neat and organized. Therefore summer break projects should be teacher-designed to be more efficient, organized, and helpful for both students and teachers
