Many schools offer the option for their students to take their classes online. This is a great option that those schools include into their systems. By letting students take their respective classes online, it would relieve a pressure off of the student. At home school can benefit students by letting them feel more comfortable at home and not having lack of sleep.

First, students would feel more comfortable doing their school work at home. Letting students take their classes online reduces the risk of peer pressure. Without having to go to school the student would not have to worry about another student trying to get them involved in any accidents in the school. The online courses make students feel like they belong, not to where they have the need to fit into the crowd and be like everyone else. The courses encourages students to be who they are not who they are not. Many students feel more relaxed when they can eat and listen to the teacher teach, but many teachers do not allow eating their classrooms. If the student takes their class at home from the comfort of his or her bed they can eat all they want and still do the class at the same time. Hence, online courses make students feel more comfortable not making them feel the effects of peer pressure, not making them have to fit in, and letting them eat all their heart desires.

Second, students will not be as tired. Many if not all high school students stay up all night whether it is playing games, crying over a lover, or simply homework. With the online courses students would not have to worry about waking up early for school, instead they can work up at a decent hour and start their work. Students feel the need to take naps during the day and with the online classes they can. Students have a certain hour at the end of the day that all the classes must be taken. With that stamped hour students can take naps in betweenÂ classes so that they feel refreshed for the course they take. Another disadvantage of regular school would be the student having to stare at a teacher all day. Nobody wants to sit and listen to a teacher go on about a subject for hours, but with the online option students can watch videos and play challenging games as they learn. Therefore, students wont be as tired because of the ability to start classes later, naps between classes, and fun activities in classes.

Yet, many teachers believe that letting a student take a online course would make them lazy and lack social skills. It may be true but students get lazy in school all the time. They will get bored and start to not do their work or just not come to school at all. Students will not lack communication skills either because they can video call others that are taking the courses online and work together on homework. There would be no difference from an adult that does their work at home on a computer instead of showing up to the work place everyday. Students are disliking school more and more and there has to be an alternative.

In conclusion, online school can be more beneficial to students by letting them feel more comfortable while they learn and not being exhausted everyday but well energized. School systems are changing fast and for the better. You need to make the decision if you are going to join them or be left behind.
