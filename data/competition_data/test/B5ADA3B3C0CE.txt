dear principle,

I am giving my opinion on weather you should bane phones or not . To me i don't not think you should bane cell phones ! If you banned cell phones and there was an emergency and none of the phones in school worked how would we call for help? I think that instead of banning cell phones permanently you should let us use them at lunch or during any other free time we have .

I understand you might not want them on campus because people tend to try and text during class but i think if you let us use them at lunch it during free time we might not want to text during class.
