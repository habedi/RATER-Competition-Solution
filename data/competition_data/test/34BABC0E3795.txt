I think students should be able to participate in after school activities if they have a c for a lot of reasons. One reason why is because some students don't learn as fast as others so some students grades might not be as good as others either. Also if that student is not good at one subject why should they kick him off the team. I also think that the teachers should help a student that is not doing good.

It does not matter about the learning pace of students. I think that because some students learn faster they will get good grades and they will if they want to be able to be on a team. So what happens with the people who don't learn as fast. They won't get a b and they won't be able to be on a team. so at least if they can get a c than they can be.

Everyone has a subject that they are not that good at. For example i am not good at science. so why should they stop someone from being on a team if they struggle at one subject. Now if you are totally failing then they could stop you from being on a team for you can get more studying time. But a c no way.

It is all about the teachers and the way they teach. Some teachers don't teach really well and you end up failing their class, But if they are good teachers and they explain things clearly to you then you should pass, But if you are failing then the teachers should make you stay after school for they could try to make you understand the concept on which he is trying to make you understand.

So my main point is that if you have a c they should let you participate in school activities. because one students don't learn as fast as others. two some students might not be good at one subject and three teachers should at least try to help a student that is not doing so well. So I hope the principle agrees with me, But do you!
