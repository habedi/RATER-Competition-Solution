Mars has alot of land forms like cracks,crators,and hills. I am certian it has land formations if it has hills and cracks. Erosion created land forms on earth with wind and rocks falling on each other like a slow chain reaction. It is highly posible for it to have happened on mars may tousands possibly millions of years ago to star erosion. Mars is filed with many resonses for it not to be livable if it were ever consitered apon. It most likely a cluster of dust and bolders than live beings made this face. People see faces in every thing from light sockets to morfed trees. I know the face on the moon is a popular land formation like the ''Grand Canyon''. It be impossible to not try to think aliens did it but there are things here on earth famous we didn't create. I know mars has land forms too.
