Dear Principal,

In my option i think we should go with policy 1. Because we should be able to bring our cell phones to school in case of any emergency. Just as long as we have our cell phones turned off during class. And during any free time we should be allowed to use our phones. I mean what if one day our school locked down because some criminal was in the building. But nobody knew exactly where he was in the building. And it so happened that he was in one of the classrooms.

And a student had their phone and was able to call the front office or maybe even the police. To get some help eminently. That could be a very good help to the principal and the staff. I know that maybe the teachers don't trust us because of issues they've had before with cell phones.

But i really think this could be an excellent way to show the teachers that we are old enough to have some adult responsibility's try this new policy. Some people like the trouble makers ruin it for the rest of us because they don't know how to act like young adults. But i don't think that's fair for the rest of us who know how to act. Because all because of the childish behavior we also have to be punished. When it should only be the trouble makers punished for their actions. If this was your child would you want them to be punished from things they didn't do. Or would you want the teachers to take away special opportunity's like having their cell phones at school just because of some peoples decisions i' m more than sure you wouldn't want that to happen. What if your child was at school and they were in a situation to where they needed to use their cell phone for an emergency. I' m sure you would try everything in your power to talk to the principal and have him allow the students to have their cell phones at school. So i really hope you take my options in consideration and allow us to have policy 1 at our school.
