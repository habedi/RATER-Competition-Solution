A Modern School

We live in a world that is constantly changing specially in the technological field. Technology has changed every aspect of our lives including education in schools. Technology has become an asset to students' education because it has revolutionized the way in which students learn. It has also provided many different ways of learning one of them being distance learning. I believe many students can benefit from distance learning because of its accessibility and the change in the environment.

Distance learning allows students to attend their classes from home through video conferencing. It is this accessibility factor that makes distance learning a favorable option for many students. Video conferencing prevents students from missing lectures under circumstances that are out of their control. For example, if a student is sick and is required to stay home for a few days they have the opportunity watch the lectures from home through video conferencing when otherwise he/she would have missed them and consequently fallen behind on schoolwork.

Some may argue that allowing students to take classes from home will be detrimental to the students' learning because the home environment will be too distracting. However, taking classes from the commodity of their home not only provides students with a peaceful environment, but it also eliminates distraction from peers which allows students to concentrate better. Moreover, distance learning also allows students to get extra sleep in the morning;

thus, increasing their academic performance. Students that can attend their classes from home do not have to go through the hassle of getting ready in the morning and driving to school. On average, students take at least 30 minutes to get ready for school and then they spent another 30minutes driving to school and waiting for classes to start. In contrast, distance learning students simply have to turn on their electronic device and watch the lecture.

In conclusion, distance learning is a new way of learning that many students can benefit from. The benefits of distance learning go beyond its accessibility since the change in the learning environment from a classroom one to a comfortable home one can easily impact the student's academic performance. Even though not everyone would choose distance learning as their preferable learning choice it is definitely an option worth considering.
