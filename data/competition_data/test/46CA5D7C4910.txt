Dear Ma'am/Sir,

I want to make a garden so I can pick out the vegetables and serve it in the soup kitchen for those who are in need.

So i could start out with one vegetable, and make it a garden. I would pick my fellow classmates to help me out in my garden, or my neighbors. I would plant vegetables or fruits like carrots, and cabbages, and strawberries, oranges, kiwis, and potatoes. Then pick them out and clean them and serve it in the soup kitchen.

I would really like to help out in the soup kitchen, and feed the others in need.

It would really great to help out. Here we are eating anything ,and they are starving for food that they cannot get.

So I suggest we help them out with good, healthy, food.

I think that this would really help out, and make it even useful to others. Providing food for those who are in need.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
