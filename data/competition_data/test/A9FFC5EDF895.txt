Strike! A comett just struck Mars. Where the comett hit looks like an animal of some sort, but there are also many things on earth that look like it could have been made by man or something else. The Face on Mars was not made by man or aliens.

The Face and many other formation are pretty common aroung the Cydonia. Shadows can also give the alusion that the Face has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. In addition, scientists have proven that the Face is not made by aliens and that it was made by a natural cause. Then they started taking more pictures.

The first picture shows that it was just taken when there were clouds and couldn't really tell what it showed. They waited for a day without clouds and took another photo. The picture they got clearly showed that the Face wasn't made by aliens and was just a land form.

The scientists proved it was a land form by comparing it to others similar to those on earth. When word got out it was kind of disapointing for the public. There were so many movies about the face on mars and it stayed for a long time.

The face was never made by aliens. It was nothing more than a mesa or a land form. Also if anyone tries to say that aliens were the ones who made the Face on Mars, don't believe them. It was probably made by a comett or one of those storms that Mars has every now and then.
