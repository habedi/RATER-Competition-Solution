Dear Principal,

I think policy two is the best idea ,you should not let students have there cell phones in school at all. I think this because this could be a big distraction to the students, they may disobey the rules and use them in class, and also because they could send answers to a important test through a text.

When students use there phone that is mainly what they focus on when they are talking on the phone or texting . They may get in trouble using there phones because they are so distracted. For example say a student gets in trouble for using there phone's when a teacher is trying to talk to them. Cell phones could get students in to big trouble! I know when i am using my phone it is mainly what i focus on. Parents send there children to school to learn not be on there cell phones they can do that at home, cell phones are a bad idea!

Most school's do not allow students to use there cell phones because they are in school and don't need to but they always catch someone disobeying the rules and using it in class. We don't want this to happen when students should be paying attention to the teacher not on there cell phones.

You should strongly pressure students to leave there cell phones in there lockers and if they don't banded the cell phones to let them no that you are very serious about this and do not want cell phones during school hours.

Now think about it if you let students have there cell phones with them and use them out of class some may use them in class. For example what if you are having a big test and need everyone to do well to pass the class, say one person really doesn't want to study and needs a good grade to pass the class they may ask another student in the class to send them the answers to the test through a text! This is one thing that could happen we do not want this!

Now do you think cell phones are a bad idea during school hours, school is a time for learning not for focusing on your cell phones so i would strongly say that cell phones are a bad idea for three important reasons cell phones could be a big distraction to the students, they may disobey the rules and use them in class, and they can also send answers to an important test through a text. Cell phones i think are a bad idea, what do you think?
