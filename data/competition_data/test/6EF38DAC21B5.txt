My opinion on Driverless cars? I personally do not think we should have them because, if we did then Technology would be taking over the world. What's next driveless Lawn Mowers? No, Driveless cars is a dumb and stupid idea. If we have cars that drive themselves then the world would become really lazy.

In the article it had said that they would be having "Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and NIssan" cars that can drive themselves by 2020. Just think of if that actually happened how many people would be obese and not getting exercise. Yeah driving really is not a form of physical fitness. The world is already lazy enough as it is so having cars that can drive themselves that would just make the world even lazier.

There are some positives like it could make driving safer for some people and teens that are not so good driving and how to hold their hands etc.. All in all It could go both ways it could be good and bad. I honestly seeing it ending badly but that is just my opinion. I do not think that having cars that can drive theirself is a good idea. It takes the fun out of growing up.

So what if we did having driveless cars it would take away a lot of money because then kids would not need driver ED, which cost roughly $400 to $475 and that is only some places. Other it cost as much as $800 just to even do driver ed. Just think about how many kids do driver ed and how much money that brings in. What if no one decides they want a driveless car then what? it would be a huge wast of money.

If all the reason I have provided is not enough to make people vote against driverless cars then I do not know what would. There are so many reason why there should not be driverless cars. There are some reason why there should not be driverless cars than they are why we should have them. So how about driving just stays the way it is.
