Proving The Face is Just a Natural Landform.

Although this face was unexpected,that doesn't nessasarily define that the face has anything to do with aliens. There are majority of theories we can assume from this topic. Few scientist condoned that this mysterious face had something to do with a very unordinary prediction .Some scientist seemed surprised when they saw the photograph of the face on mars.

As a scientist, many mistakes are made during observations, but that's apart of human life. Mistakes are casual in everyday life and, all of us make them. In my opinion, I don't think this entertaining outbreak had anything to do with aliens. In fact, they're wasn't a specific sign, or clue that an alien was actually was involved. NASA got a great shot at the face, and the picture closely showed that their was nothing do be deeply concerned about.

The face was defineitly rare, but over the years the face continues to fade so it shouldn't be harmful. If it happened to really be an alien, we would know from the recordings, and pictures that were captured. This is a huge topic to discuss, and space can likely be considered as a horrifying setting due to rumors, and scientific observations. Astrounaunts never discovered any issues, or new assumptions by traveling to space.

The main point is aliens aren't realistic, you may see them in movies, books, or perhaps may hear about them. An alien was never discovered by NASA, and the face just appeared to be a natural cause. The face could of been anything, but we know it wasn't an alien because there is no proof that the face was an alien, and still isn't as we speak.

In conclusion, think about other things that are possible.
