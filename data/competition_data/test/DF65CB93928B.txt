The electoral college doesn't work for everyone its not fair. There are people who want a good president to run the conutry, not just some guy that the electors pick. Electorl College is not a good way to pick a president the people are not picking them isnt that want it suppost to be people pick the president not electors. In the text the author write that the electorl college doesnt let the people that have the most vote win because your picking a elector and the elector is picking the president even though he/she has the most vote its not fair. We the people should be the ones picking the president, we are the one who want him/her to run the coutry because we think he/she can do it.  The electoral college should be abolishied and people should pick the president.

There are state in our conurty that are smaller then other states. Those small states dont get a say in the voting for the president because the bigger states rule over because of the electorl college rule. The author says "larger states like Flordia has 29 electorl vote and Wyoming only has 3 electorl votes." So that means that the larger states get more attention form the president then the smaller states do. That's not fair the smaller states should be treated like the bigger states not left out. The electrol college (electors)is the one picking the president not the peoplein the small or large states. The electorl college should be removed and the people picking the president and the smaller states get a say in it too.
