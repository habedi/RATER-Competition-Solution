Do I agree or do I disagree with my principals decision that all students must participate in a extracurricular activity?

Yes I agree because one so kids can become more activity, and be able to be good at the activity.

What I mean when I say ÃÂ¨kids becoming more activeÃÂ¨ is so they wonÃÂ´t be lazy, a game head, and a bad influence to other children.

Some kids just want to stay home and play games like Madden NFL 20, NBA 2k20, Call of Duty, and etc.

But if they do activities like track, basketball, and football.

When someone is a bad influence to other kids IÃÂ´m saying if one kid thinks its cool and fun to gang band and do other horrible things than other people are going to want to join in on it as well.

But if people see one or two people playing a sport for their school or helping out with the school yearbooks than others are going to say ÃÂ¨IÃÂ´m going to do that to.ÃÂ¨

Example my mother told me that I was lazy, and said I couldnÃÂ´t do anything.

So I told her ÃÂ¨I was going to try out for trackÃÂ¨ to see how i was going to do.

To see if it was going to make her change her mind about everything she said and make her regret it.

Another reason was so they can be able to be good at the activity.

Being good at something like a sport or at a video game is good but video games arenÃÂ´t an extracurricular activity.

You want to do something your good at example im good at football and somewhat good at basketball but I mainly like football but I mostly play basketball cause I want to get good at it so i can go pro one day but if im able to get good at it than iÃÂ´ll go back to football and try to go pro there.

If you great at something then your going to have haters or people who are to doubt you in every way possible.

You have to show them that you can be excellent at every thing and your going to have to prove to them that you can do it and prove them wrong.

So they can feel sorry for what they said about you.

But if you not so good at something like a school activity or school sport all you have to do is keep practicing and keep working hard and make evryone proud of you including your family, friends, teachers, and more people in life.

But you canÃÂ´t be good at something if you donÃÂ´t try cause you may think its easy when you first try but then as you continue to do it oh its going to become more difficult and irritating.

If you give up try your best to boost your confidence so you can try one more time and see if youÃÂ´ll be good at it and maybe be called ÃÂ¨The Greatest of All Time.ÃÂ¨

They were my reasons to why I agreed with my principles idea that all students must do at least one extracurricular activity.

I listed my examples to support my reasonings, specific details, and and my my reason to why I wrote/types this.
