"Huge rock fomation. . .which resembles a human head....." Was created by aliens; or was it. People come up with some insane conspiracy's from how people who have died are still alive or that amusment parks are haunted by the dead... but this is the craziest one. People actually believe there is life on Mars, and that it created a face do you?

The "Face" was not created by aliens. For you to say the the "Face" was created by Extra Terriestrials it would be like saying that the conspiracy theory that the faces has "haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years" is real like how is that possible. Also the exsits of aliens is "evidence that NASA would rather hide..." (Instead then sharing it with the public they rather not worry the world.)

So what, do you still believe that something that has no proof to even exsits still created a faces on the plant Mars? Or do you now believe that it's just a natural landform? People actually believe there is life on Mars, and that it created a face do you?
