Dear Principal,

I would like to share with you my position on community service, and suggest for it to be a mandatory assignment.

First of all, community service requires people to take time out of their schedule, and benefit something. If we are required to do this, this would teach that anything 'important' you might have planned, probably is not as important as bettering a community. It teaches good values to students, and at this age, good values and opinions are important for a kid to grow up with. Because in later life as adults, we will either be thankful for this, or regret not having this opportunity.

Right now, community service isn't required. And most students won't go out of their way to do something for others if they don't have to do it. Some students don't like to try new things. If they have to try community service, who knows, they might enjoy it. Of course, there will always be students who won't. But the few more students will make a difference, big or small, the better. Maybe they will continue doing community service throughout there life. The more people willing to tutor a kid, feed the homeless or pick up trash, the better the community.

Lastly, teens these days are very ignorant. Most spend all their time on the TV, on the computer or playing video games. They aren't exposed to much, so they assume many things about the dying forests, dirty beaches and the communities in need. Especially with how some parents might raise their kids, students won't know how it feels on the other side. Helping out a needy community will expose them to the needy, the ghetto, and nature in need of help. Requiring community service will teach students about these things, and know how much help they need. Requiring community service will not only benefit the needy community, but benefit the students as well.
