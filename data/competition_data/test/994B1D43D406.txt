Students being required to join clubs at school is unfair and shouldn't be aloud. I think that having clubs for students to join and have the opportunity too is great and not at lot of kids around the world have that opportunity. But having students, especially teenagers required to join clubs could even make them resent school. It takes time out of every ones day, the students, teachers, and parents. Students being required to take clubs affects everyone.

Parents of these children will have to move around their work schedule to make the time to drive their kids to and from their clubs, and that isn't really fair. And what if the clubs cost money and students can't participate, what would happen then? Schools alone already have clubs to join but maybe some of the clubs don't appeal to students but they're forced to join one anyway, again thats not fair. Students also have a life outside of school, they may already do a sport, homework, work, or chores they need to do at home. Students have a life outside of school and shouldn't be forced to spare their own time.

There are a few reasons why it can be good though too. Schools could make money from the clubs and have more opportunities to help with their school. Some of the club's schools could help students in the future, then if students see themselves playing a sport in the future they can get a head start with the club. This could be a general idea for most clubs open to students. Joining a club could also help students be more social and meet people who have the same interests in them. If the school decides too, they could open clubs that could help them in the future for example, they could open a club that teaches students how to pay bills or taxes.

I think if students wanted to join a club they should, just as long as they want to and their not forced or required to. From my perspective as a student, if we were required to join a club it should be during school time not our own. Students have other things they also need to do in their life besides school. I think clubs are a great idea and do help you make friends and meet new people. If you choose the right club it could be an amazing thing for you. Clubs can be helpful for students sometimes, but again forcing them isn't the way to go.

Being required to take a club has its ups and downs. Having students participate in clubs could cause money and social problems. But it could give students opportunities and help them in the future. This should be a students choice, not the schools. If the school wants to make students take clubs on their own time, they need to check with parents too first. In conclusion, I think clubs are a great idea for students just as long as its their choice and they get to choose the club they want to be in.
