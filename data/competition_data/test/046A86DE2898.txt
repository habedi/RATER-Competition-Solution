Have your parents ever forced you to do a sport? You usually end up not having fun. If you're doing activities against your will, why would you want to bring that to school? Extra curricular activities shouldn't be enforced because it interferes with the parents' schedule, it takes away the students' factor of choice, and it prevents teachers from going home at their typical time.

To start off, enforcing after school activities isn't a great idea because it can interfere with parents' schedules. For example, parents might not be able to pick up their kids late, possibly due to the fact that they need someone to help out with their younger children. If kids are held after school, the parents will need to rearrange their schedule in order to be there for their kids. In addition, this policy could prevent the parents from being able to pick their kids up. depending on how late the extracurricular activities run, parents could be busy with other things, such as grocery shopping, by the time their kid gets out of school. Also, some parents depend on public transportation. If there isn't a conveniently scheduled bus, the child won't have a way to get home. These scenarios demonstrate how enforcing clubs, sports, or groups can intervene with parents' schedules.

Secondly, having extracurricular activities after school as a priority isn't a good idea because it takes away the student's factor of choice. Adding on, children won't be as independent as they would have been, which will effect them later in life. If they don't build their individuality now, then they could possibly have trouble with it in years to come. In addition, students could feel controlled. If these policies are made, kids could feel like they don't have a say in what goes on in their space of education. Also, children will have to schedule their outside life around after school. They might be put in a position where they have to let go of activities they're passionate in, simply to not get in trouble at school. These three examples show why extracurricular policies will take away a child's choice.

Lastly, making extracurricular activities a necessity isn't an great decision because it forces teachers to stay later. To start, teachers have a life after school, and staying later than normal could interfere on that. Also, educators might have to complete chores, such as buying groceries, before a certain time each day. Having them stay late could throw off their whole routine. Lastly, many teachers have kids of their own. Depending on their age(s), they will get dismissed from school at different times. This is why necasary extracurricular activities will affect a teacher's schedule.

As shown in these paragraphs, enforcing extracurricular activities can affect the parents' everyday plan, prevent kids from making their own choices, and interfere with teachers' after school life. Holding back students affects more than just the kids. It affects everyone involved, and more. With these explanations, hopefully you won't be forced to play a sport or join a group again.
