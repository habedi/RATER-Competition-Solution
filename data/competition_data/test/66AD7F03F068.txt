If the principal decided to force every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity I would disagree with it because. You can't just force people to do an activity just because you think it's a good idea, You should just keep it the same so people can choose if they want to do an activity so people don't get mad, If people disagree with it like I don't then less people with want to come here, If everyone has an activity they won't have as much time to get their homework done then they can get a low grade or (if they want to) stay up late at night trying to get it done, but then the people who do stay up will be tired then they can't focus and they can get bad grades for not being able to stay awake to do the work, If you do some kind of active sport and your tired from staying up to do your homework you won't do good in that sport then if you do something like basketball then the coach won't send you out because you can't do their best from staying up so that person is just there for no reason or they just want to watch the game. And that is why I think we shouldn't be forced to do an activity.
