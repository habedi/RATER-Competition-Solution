When you think of smog what do you think of,thick blanket of cloud covering a citie like China or Los Angeles. What if it was all over becuase of cars in every crowded country around the world.

They have done this because there tail pipe emmisions,the smoke is unhealthy to breathe,and most people cant afford a car.

The emmisions from the tail pipe that comes out of the car is cause in most passengers car is the cause for the 12% of the greenhouse gases in Europe and 50% in the U.S.A.most cities have been trying to cut back on the car use or public transportation many will still ride a bus or drive to avoid walking or bycicling.

Most people dont realize that luxury comes with a hevfty price in life. You want to get there fast to that certain place and destroy what helps you breathe and survive or do you want to get there still and keep alive this rock.
