There are many differant reasons why you should participate in being a seagoing cowboy. These reasons are the following: you are helping people, you are helping their country, and you are helping spread peace.

The first reason that you should consider being a seagoing cowboy is that you are helping other people. You are helping them by bringing them cattle or other farm animals. By delivering farm animals to them you are helping them by giving them a food source. The people you help can eat eggs from chickens or drink milk from cows or even just kill the animals for food. Sometimes you might even just be delivering someone their pet that they shipped to safety therefore reunighting those people with their beloved pets. People can also use wool from sheep to make clothes or rope. That is how you are helping people.

The second reason is that you are helping those people's country. You are doing this by helping their economy. By delivering farm animals to them you are not only giving those people food and materials for themselves but, those people can sell them. By selling food, drinks, and materials or clothes those people are helping their economy and elderly people who cannot care for such animals. They wouldn't of been able to help their economy is they didn't have the animals to produce goods. That is how you are helping their country.

The third and final reason why you should be a seagoing cowboy is because you are spreading world peace. You are spreading world peace by giving another country something they need. If you help a country and its people they are going to take that as an example. They might help another country. Then, that country will help another and it will just keep on going like that. That is how you are spreading world peace.

That is why you should become a seagoing cowboy. You will not only help the countries in need but, also you will be helping their people and maybe even the world.
