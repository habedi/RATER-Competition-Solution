Dear principal,

I think that everyone should do community service. I think this because everyone should always be willing to help someone or their community out. We could all do some kind of community service, such as cleaning up all the trash, cutting the communities lawn, helping out the homeless and other stuff in that nature. Helping someone is always nice to do but it also makes your community look good when you have a lot of helpful people in it.

I also think that you should make a club. Just a normal club for the people who would like to do community service. Some people might not want to do community service and if they don't want to then we can't make them do it. Community service is something that people should do on their free time. If they don't have anything to do one day then I think they should do a little bit of community service, even if it's just for one day.

Community service helps make our environment better. It also helps our community stay clean. If I had the chance to join community service I would. I would do it just to make our community look nice so more people would want to come visit. If you start a club for people who want to do community service on their free time, I will be the first one to sign up.

I think that you should have all the people in our environment vote. That way you will see how many people would actually do community service. Community service isn't hard. All you have to do is take about an hour from your day and clean up trash about your neighborhood or you can also cut peoples lawns. If I was to do community service I would want to help out old people. I would want to do that because old people don't have that much longer to live and I would want them to have the best place to live, things to eat, someone always watching them, and someone always taking care of them when they need help.

Thank You,
