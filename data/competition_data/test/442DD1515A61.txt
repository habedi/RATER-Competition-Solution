To : My Principal

I think community service is a waist of time for us young people because we got things to do also. For example i take care of my niece and nephews right after school for 2 hours or 3 some times. I take care of them because my sister works all day and there's nobody too take care of the kids. And sometime she don't work. So when she doesn't i go to my moms job and help her out. So im always busy . Specially theses pass few weeks because my 15 is coming up and i have to be going to stores to buy stuff and we get home so late that we are starting to go to sleep late like at 1 or 2am. Another example one of my friends gots basketball practice every day after school at the park. There's alot of examples more, that's why i think community service is a waist of time. And i don't think yall principals should not make us do community service.
