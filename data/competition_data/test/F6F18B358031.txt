Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To me community service is important and all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should be required to participate in community service. Community service is very important. I believe responsibility for serving these hours should begin in sixth grade with a requirement of about ten hours. Then the hours per student should increase as the grade the student is in increases. If students are required to achieve service hours it will do a lot of good for them and for their community.

A positive consequence for the students at SCHOOL_NAME would be preparing them for high school. At most Catholic high schools community service is definitely a big part of a student's education. At SCHOOL_NAME or SCHOOL_NAME, service hours are required in a large quantity. This is one reason why I think community service would help the students of SCHOOL_NAME

Another reason is to teach kids at young a age the great part about helping people. Sure you could just tell them it is good to help somebody but telling them won't put them in a habit of helping. If the students go out and help others on a pretty regular basis then it will become a habit of helping others and they will do something to help more people in their community without having to think twice about it.

Community service would also be a great advantage for SCHOOL_NAME and attract more people to this school. People who see students from SCHOOL_NAME helping in their community will want to send their child here. Most parents would like to send their child to a school with community service to teach him or her morals and discipline. It would be excellent for SCHOOL_NAME to adopt this idea of community service.

In conclusion, I believe community service would do tons of good for the students, SCHOOL_NAME and the whole community. Not only would this go to the student's advantage and would give everyone, including SCHOOL_NAME, an edge. TEACHER_NAME, if you propose and adopt this idea, I guarantee you will not regret it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
