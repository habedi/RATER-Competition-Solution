B Average

If a student who played a sport had to keep a B average through out the year would be just mean. Sports take up a lot of time during the day and the rest is just studying. I've wrestled before and a I kept a C average the entire time I wrestled to stay on the team and I worked hard for that C. The thought of having try to get a C average while trying to learn wrestling moves, football plays, basketball plays etc. It wouldn't be fare to the student playing sports.

Like with football you have to study the play book or your going to walk on the field and not know what to do. Then you get chewed out by the coach and probably get kicked off the team. With all that studying g we have to prioritize what you are going to do and for me sports comes first.

For the rest of the year i get As and Bs but during sports seasons Cs and Bs are what I get. You also have think about how much time you miss at school playing sports.

You can miss tests due to games, practices, and tournaments. Just don't higher the grade to a B.

The only way I think heightening the grade to a B is if you have an in school program where you can do homework and study during lunch or another class like study hall. Have a teacher sit in a class room and give the athletes their homework and things they need to study and let them do it. Its a very good very logical solution. Athletes can also do missed tests and projects in study hall if they don't have time at home. So please if your going to change requirements to a B average at least give athletes study hall.
