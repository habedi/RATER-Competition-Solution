"Rumble rumble rumble" the after school bus roars to life as it carries uninterested students back home from a long day at school. I would love to just relax at my house, catching up on homework, or taking a small nap. Nobody should be forced upon to do an extracurricular activity.

After a day of school, some kids would be too busy to stay after.

I would fall under that category. By that I mean I already have after school events. For example, I play two sports which are soccer and basketball. I also have religious education once every week. I know that I am not the only one who feels this way. Some children could be interested in partaking in a different hobby. They might want to try something new. One of my friends is interested in playing lacrosse. She would be too tired to go out to skills evaluation because she was working at school all day. Young men and women may not even have the time for it. They already have commitments such as: practices, religion practice, homework, and other responsibilities that they need to accomplish at home. When I stay after school, I only have a little bit of time to eat dinner before I get dragged to my next activity.

However, it's not just whether or not pupils have the time and energy for extracurricular events, interest is another factor of the problem. The purpose of after school is to have students pick what they want to do and to have fun doing it. It is entirely upon the child's decision if they want to go home at regular school hours. I definitely do not like to stay at school any longer if I don't have to. I prefer to go home, and to be productive there. Some kids just aren't persuaded to participate in any of the options that after school has to offer. I am only intrigued by only a mere amount of events that goes on. Some of which don't last all year, or starts later in the year. For example, the girls' basketball team does not start until halfway through first semester. I, along with other pupils want to simply relax from a productive day's work. We may have had a bad day earlier, and we just want to go home and decompress. On my free days in which I don't have any activities post school, I love to take advantage of that and to lie down onto my bed and listen to music. Or, I can head over to a friends house and we can enjoy what little hours we have until we need to get rest for the next day.

It's not just how the young scholars feel, it is upon the parents' schedule as well. Some guardians may have work later than usual, and they might not get back until late at night. Or some, have to leave for work around the time that their child is coming home, they can't be late for their job and their kid does not posses the house key. As the guardian(s) would be at work, who could pick up the student? Late buses do not run everyday. But even if it did, the child could easily miss the bus for numerous reasons: not being able to hear their bus number called, being sent out late, or simply forgetting what bus number they are. There is also the possibility that the event let them out much earlier than the time to board the buses, someone would have the obligation to come and pick up the young man or woman. Not all post events are free, some come with fees. Perhaps an activity has a costly amount of money behind it. Not everyone could afford it, thus the pupil could not take part in the action. If the parents could not support the funding of this event, then the scholar would have to choose another post school meeting to do. Which may lead to the parent feeling remorse.

Having to participate in something that is being forced upon is not a good feeling. Kids should partake in an event because they feel good doing it, not because they had to do it.
