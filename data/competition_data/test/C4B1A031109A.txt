The author does not support his idea well. He talks about more of the cons than the pros of visiting Venus, and not really about how serious this trip could be if we do the trip. He thinks that because it was once a planet like Earth that it would still be safe, yet it is very dangerous. It is more dangerous than safe. No spacecraft has survived the landing of the trip, so what expects the author to assume people will. Right, he thinks by studying more about Venus, and building protection machines will help, but with the weather of Venus it will most likely get destroyed.

The author does not supposrt his self much by saying it is the hottest, had a lot of water, and 97% acid . More sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. He saying that it was also onece like Earth, which is a good thing, but Venus is not Earth much anymore. The text states, "Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting vlocanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on it is suface." So either way you are basically die having to go to Venus. He listed some more than bad. The fact that it is the hottest planet in our earth system is not good. Some of the good of having to exolore Venus is that it is sometimes our closer option to spce traveling, but a sad part is that there is a insisputable ways of you returuning.

If you do end up making it to Venus and landing, there's and small chance of you dying by the weather there.

The author did not support his idea because he put more of the cons into the article than the pros. He did have some pros, but they did not really halp with the argument because the cons just ruled over them. He should have done more research on the pros, or listed less cons. In the last paragraph, 8, the author states, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation" is technically not true. It is not true because if you are willing to out a life in a rocket and not have any doubts is scary. You are gonna have doubts, but it is not as though you want to have them. You do not want someone to loose their life because you did not care. By having doubts, you are pretty much shwing you care, and that you do not want anything to go wrong. By having dangers, in a way helps us to know how to be safe. So, there is nothing wrong with doubts and dangers because those keep us safe.
