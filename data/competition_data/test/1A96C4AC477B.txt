Dear Principal ,

I believe that students should not be allowed to bring phones to school at all . Students may text in class and not get the full education they need . Phones are a distraction to students from completing work and it doesn't keep them on task . Phones take time away from learning and getting the education needed in a day in school .

Many students tend to use the phones and other devices during class hours , they usually tend to not complete the class assignments . If they do finish , most other answers come out wrong . Phones in school are a major distraction to all students and i believe they should not be allowed in school even if they are on or off because even if the students claim the phones are off , they can always turn it right back on . They may use it while their reading a book , which in this case their not . Students may be using the phone and not actually working or studying as they say they are .

Students might bring phones to school to use for an emergency , if so they can always contact their parents by using the school phones and contacting the teacher for help all so . Therefore , i agree with Policy 2 . Not to have phones in school at all . Its a complete distraction in class and it doesn't help in completing anything what so ever . Phones are one of the reasons why students usually fail a grade or have to retake classes in the next grade that they go to .
