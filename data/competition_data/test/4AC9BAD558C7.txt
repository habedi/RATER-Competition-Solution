The picture that was tooken by nasa was carefully looked through.

They took a picture of it 10 times to try and get a perfect shot of it.

Although it was it was hard to get because of the blurr that was in the way from Nasa spacecraft.

Nasa first released the photograph to the public on the JPL website. They explanied that the picture was had no alien markings.

Nasa had stated that how could it be an alien if there was no alien mounuments found after all.

After going and getting a picture they tried again when it was summer time so it would be easier to find. The photograph was took in a ditigal image so if anything like airplans or stuff of that short you could see what they are.

Nasa was convinced that it had nothing to do with aliens. On the other hand the public though nasa was trying to lie and cover it up.

What the picture really was just A martian eqivalent of a butte or mesa landforms.

That was very common around the American west. Some people think it mostly reminds them of middle Butte in the snake River Plain of idaho.

There is a lava dome in that spot that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars.

The face on mars was clearly a natural landform.

We have over dozens of explainations for it.

All of the explaintions make logocal sense to how the landform of the face was created.
