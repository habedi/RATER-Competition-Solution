Dear,Principal

I am writing this letter to you to try and change your decision on requiring students to make community service mandatory. I believe that community service should be a chance to help the community, to boost a grade or to just help the school in general, but it shouldn't have to be a mandatory grade or activity. Community service is meant to help the community not give a student a grade, if that person chooses to not help then we should let him/her be, not give the person a bad grade. I personally do not think it would do much harm to us, but if you were to make this a requirement I'm sure there would be many students who would disagree and just skip the class or show up and not even do anything. In conclusion I would like for you to just please take this letter in to consideration and I know i am just one student, but I'm sure a lot of other students would agree with me.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
