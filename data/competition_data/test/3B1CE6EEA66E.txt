Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To my understanding, it is a huge debate whether students should be required to perform some sort of community service or not. Not only does community service help the environment, your community, your neighbors, and the earth you live on, but is a great activity many students take part in, and i think that it should be required to all students.

In our world today, community service really make a difference. Our communities depend and prosper from people lending a hand to keep their environments safe. If more students were to perform community service, it would not only effect their living environment but also their learning environment. Our school is filled with many great students who love to help out, and i think community service will allow students to lend a helping hand.

There are many ways to help out in your community. You could help pick up trash in your neighborhood, or you could volunteer at a homeless shelter. You can have fun while helping out your environment. Students could help clean the area around their school, to keep it clean and make it more safe. Students could also volunteer at a local soup kitchen, to help make food for those who really need it. I think requiring students to do community service will not only educate students on how important it is to take care of their environment but it would also teach them to appreciate more of what they have, because seeing families or individuals who are less fortunate really makes you become more grateful for all the things you are supplied with.

Some students may not want to pick up trash or cook for the needy. Maybe some students prefer to work with animals. There could also be local pet hospitals, or animal pounds where you could help out at. Animals, also, need to be taken care of, and if all the animals living in your community are safe and healthy, it makes for a more safe and healthy environment for you to live in.

Community service really is a great way for students to help out and that is why i don't hesitate to say that it would benefit the whole school; the whole world. Whatever type of community service you do, it is still making the world we live in today a safer place for our present and for our futures.
