Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to my attention that you are thinking about making a rule to not allow students with a C or below average to be allowed to play sports or participate in after school activities .

Well, i see where you are coming from when making this rule but it is simply not right and will not work.

For kids sports are the perfect thing to let a lot of stress out. If kids are stressed out a lot they will not have the concentration to do well in school henceforth they may even do worse!

Also to not let them do after school activities is just as bad.

This will not allow students to have something to put on high school or college applications. Plus after school activities will also help relieve stress by allowing students to spend time with friends.

But most importantly since a good part of students have a C average they will not be allowed to do any sports or activities so they will all be stressed out and unable to play any sports or do any activities so the students with a B average or higher will not be allowed to participate in them either because there will not be enough people on a team.

Is that right to have the A and B students suffer also?

I know that you are just trying to make grades better so instead of this what you can do is anyone that has a C or lower average they must spend at least 2 hours per week getting tutored.

So i implore you please do not make this a school rule!

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
