Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering to let students have cell phones in our school.

I have written this letter to try and convince you not to.

If students are able to text, chat, call, and play with their phones and with other people, no one would learn anything anymore.

Nearly all the students would be immersed in their cell phones, and with the cell phones available, people could search the web, go online, play games, listen to music, practically everything, right there on their cell phone.

I assure you that if you let people have their cell phones, average grades would be lower than if they didn't, as not everyone one would be paying attention to the teacher's lecture, power-point, video, etc., but instead they would be secretly texting each other and searching the web or playing games.

It is very easy to hide a cell phone while using it.

It could be in a book, or under a desk.

And yet, these are not the only issues.

Some of the students here don't have as much financially as other students.

The cell phones will arouse jealousy and lead to stealing.

If you have this rule in place, you can potentially be accounted responsible for lost or stolen phones.

If you are seriously considering this, don't let students have their cell phones at all.

They would not need to pay attention in class or learn anything, instead, they would just need some WiFi to look it up on their phone.

Don't allow students to have their cell phoned on and in use every day.

If you truly care about your students education at this school, you will listen to this, and ban all cell phone use.

So what shall it be. Do you care about your students, or not?

Sincerely,

One of your students
