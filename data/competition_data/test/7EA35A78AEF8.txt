Dear principal,

I'm against making students have at least a B average in all classes to keep their spot in school activities. Most students have a C average during the school year. Parents would agree with me that if they have at least a B and it drops and the students are working very hard then they should still be allowed to participate in sports and other school activities. If a student is working hard in sports and focus on that for a career or their future then they wouldn't need to have a B average to keep that dream.

Many Students stay around a B average for the year and if the school makes them have a B or above most of them wouldn't be able to play sports or do other activities. Some students are very smart and would maybe stay on the team if they have a B average. Students shouldn't feel left out if their not smart and are good in other things. There are a lot of students that are athletic but not school smart.

Parents would agree with me that if they have at least a B and it drops and the students are working very hard then they should still be allowed to participate in sports and other school activities. Students may work very hard to succeed in school work but many just focus on other things as sports or other activities, so they might not have a B average. If they have just one class they can't keep a B average in than that's not fair to them, they may just have trouble concentrating in that class or need extra practice but that's no reason to not let them play in sports or be in activities.

If a student is working hard in sports and focus on that for a career or their future then they wouldn't need to have a B average in school. Many students now days want an athletic career or something their good at. If a student doesn't want out be something that has something to do with work then they shouldn't have to keep their grades up. There's many students that have big dreams of becoming famous or something like that but some students need to have school and have a B or higher to do many things.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
