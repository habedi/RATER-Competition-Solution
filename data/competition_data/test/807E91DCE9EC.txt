Dear Principle,

Due to the recent fascination with cell phones and all the new technology, I can definitely see why you need the change in policy. You see, allowing cell phones as long as they are turned off for class and the ability to use them for free times, helps make a connection with your students. No one wants a principle that is too controlling, as in Policy 2, and you can't have students' cell phones ring all the time because it's distracting to the learning environment. That's why Policy 1 is a great compromise and a choice that benefits both sides.

If you did take cell phones away, you would create an awful tension between you and your students. People would be angry that one of their rights was taken away in a matter of seconds. What used to be acceptance would become anger and resistance. By banning cell phones you would make it seem as if bringing your cell phone would make you more of a rebel. Either way, this new policy would make students even more inclined to bring their cell phones.

Now let's say you picked Policy 1. People don't like change, but this time it isn't so big, which therefore means that people would be willing to accept it. By doing this you don't seem like a dictator and it's not pure chaos so this is an amazing choice that would create a bond of understanding. Not everyone is understanding as you may wish, but think of it as a life lesson for the students. Life isn't perfect. People just have to deal with that.

You may seem reluctant to this new age of technology and allowing cell phones but the truth is cell phones aren't all bad. I personally know many students that use there phone to get the homework assignments they missed or a calculator or even to check the time! When you are sick you need to call someone to get the homework. If you banned cell phones from school, it would take a lot longer to get the assignments. It's true that we also play games on our phones but it's to escape the shackles of society every once in a while.

Policy 1 is the best choice. It creates a compromise between your students that is fair. Students would agree that this is the best choice by far. Whether they like it or not, this is a choice and people will accept that. It's not to big of a difference either. People will adjust and life will go on. It's a choice that benefits both sides. These are the reasons you should pick Policy #1.

Sincerely, A student of yours
