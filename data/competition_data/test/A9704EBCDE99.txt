I have been asked to write about should school projects continue on summer break. if so should they be teacher-designed or student-designed?.

i would have to go with student designing the projects i would make the project more interesting. because its your idea that you came up with and created and just threw it all together. also you get to show the teacher and other students your idea. and its just not all about me i would be able to see other friends creations as well just make work more easier and have a more fun with summer projects who would wanna keep doing hard core teacher work on there summer break not a lot of kids would enjoy this some kids wouldnt even like summer work they just wanna be kids and enjoy they time out of school and just be work free if this was to happen the teacher should find things to make these projects more fun if they was just teacher designed like group projects that way you could have help and its summer i would want to stay with a buddy anyway and thats good Because we could have our fun and have time for our project but if its just a regular project thats boring not a lot of kids gone get it done once again its summer who wants to sit in they house and work on a project not even that your working all by yourself ion see it all really depends on the projects really it could be like making a tiny robot or a hand held slingshot all depends i dont think it should be a hard one although we only get 2 months out of school we gone need some time to let our brain rest and not burn yourself out and over work and then got to come right back to school thats a lot of working and no one should over push them self even the best need there time to stop and rest so its 50/50 with these sections well there you have i just broke down all my reason of why i would pick to be designed by students and not teachers also got to think if you was the teacher would you wanna be nice and see what your kids could come up with their own idea or be the mean teacher and over work your students and when they come back to school the brains are everywhere bc you blew out their light bulb now you tell me what would you choose but think very deep into this and tell me why would you pick what you have chosen
