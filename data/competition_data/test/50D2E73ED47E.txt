Dear, principle

I think that community service should not be required because i think that if a student is forced to do community service that they will not do there best in helping others they will probably be very annoyed that the school is making them do that and they will probably goof off and do little work.

I think it would also not be a good idea because some people like to help others and others don't and it would be unfair to make students do stuff they don't want to do especially if it is manual labor ,what if a student could have a problem do things like picking up sticks or raking leaves. Another problem there might be is if the student does nothing at all what if he or she just sits and refuses to help the community .

I ,in my personal opinion think that making children learn is more important than helping others and school is supposed to be about education and taking students out of school and making them work sounds like more of a volunteer thing than a requirement and i think that many would agree with me .All students have life's outside of school too ,so if they assigned as a homework that wouldn't work either. Doing it in school would not help them learning. All in all it sounds like a bad idea to me to have community service in schools.
