Dear Principal,

I believe in the first policy, this would mainly be because it is fair to both the students and the teachers. That we would be aloud to use and have our phones during a free period or lunch break, remembering that they should be turned off during any class time at all. This would let the students enjoy using their phone's during lunch, which is already like our free time. On the other side of things, this would also be good for the teachers, because this would mean that less kids would try to have their phone on during class if they were given time at lunch and/or recess to use it. Also, this would help to un-clog the offices in the school at least a little, because if someone had forgotten clothes for a sports practice or something such as that; thee child could text or call their parents at lunch/recess and wouldn't need to use the phone in the office. Then, that would lead to giving the secretaries more free-time to do work... instead of helping children try to contact their parents or guardians. These would all be good reason to let kids bring their phones to school and be aloud to use them during lunch or recess; just as long as they were kept turned off during class time.

Although some people might argue some bad reasons for allowing kids to bring their phones to school to use during free periods or lunch. Some of these might include kids keeping their phones with them after their free period or lunch. Another would be that they might forget their phone at home anyway and still have to use the office phone. One other might be that children would still try to sneak it into all of their classes, and that this little freedom would provoke them to break the rules further.

My response to the worries above include that most of the kids would be satisfied just by being able to have their phone with them at lunch so they wouldn't have a reason it bring it to their other classes after. My answer to the problem that followed that was simply; all children around the teenager age always have their phone with them, or near them. They just almost always know where it is, and this proves that that problem doesn't even exist. Lastly, would like to defend the final statement. To start off, a lot of the kids would be too scared to try and take advantage of the new rules that were set into effect. To add on, it could be posted that severe punishments will come with the bringing and use of a phone into any class. This would make it a much scarier thing for the majority of the students at our school. In the end, I think that the best choice would be to allow use to use our phones during a lunch, recess, or free period, as long as it is turned off during class time, and we abide all of the other rules.

~Sincerely:
