Dear Principle,

I do not think that all students should be required to perform community service. I do not agree with this requirement because not all kids have time in their regular day to perform community services. Some students have after school sports that take up much of their time. Other students already have things at home they need to take care of. Some could have to watch younger brothers and sisters while their parents work, or watch pets while the parents work. Some students even are already starting jobs young to raise a little extra money to help out their family. I know that many students already have families, if not their own, with children that they babysit for money while the family's parents work. Community service would be a great thing to do for the students that have time for it out of their daily schedule, but for others, it just could not be possible. It is always nice to perform community service to help out, but sometimes there are other commitments that children have, and they can't just drop all of their commitments for this. That would be irresponsible, and I'm sure you want all of your students to be responsible in their commitments and outside of school activities or jobs. I'm sure their parents wouldn't allow them to break other commitments as well. So in the end, I think community service would be a great thing to volunteer, but should not be placed upon us as a requirement. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,

Student.
