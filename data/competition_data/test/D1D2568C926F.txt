Dear Principle,

This school should have the children here do community service. They should be required to learn good social skills and manners. Children nowadays are very lazy and rude to elders and people on a daily basis. The community is suffering their horrible acts to it. We need to teach them how to perform community service to save them from their community belittling.

Community service is very important. The community you live in tells who you are. Most people make their homes look nicer and the area around it to make sure nobody gets the wrong first impression about them. This should be taken into consideration. Many communities are not well kept and not nice to look at. The school's property looks horrible because of the way these kids treat it. Community service should be expected from children in this school and they should do it twice in a school year.

Manners and social skills are important to have and these kids don't. Because of this when they get a job they will be rude to their boss and the people around them whether their in a bad mood or not. If the person is trying to give a compliment and they say it the wrong way the person will be embarrassed. Without social skills they won't know how to talk to a person or know how to handle a bad situation. If you have realized ,the kids who do community service have good social skills and manners and they use they everyday!

Since the certain kids that don't do community service are lazy and don't want to do anything or get up to throw something in the trash where it belongs they throw it onto the ground and leave it there for someone else to pick it up. That is called littering. And it is illegal in some states. They could get in trouble and go to jail or get a fine. This would cause them to become behind on school work or not get into college for a little thing like littering.

All schools should have the kids do community service. If our school does it we would be setting a good example for ourselves and the kids who go to this school. That will help them get into college and get a good job. Simple things t]like manners and good social skills are very useful and are part of the bargain with community service. The kids here would be a lot nicer and put more effort into their work. Teaching these students how to perform community service would make this town and school a better place.
