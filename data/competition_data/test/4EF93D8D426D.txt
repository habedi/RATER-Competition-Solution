Dear Principal,

The new "possible" policy change for the school, is ridiculous. You, being a principal, have the right to make choices that you think is right to make your school a better place. But, our grade point average for our school is a C average. If our students have a C average, and they play sports, what makes you think they'll have time to take up all their grades to a B, let alone a B average. If they can only keep a C average doing the sports they do now, they wont have any time to study.

Sports takes up a persons life. When your in a sport, especially if you love it, you have that sport as one of your top 5 things to focus on the most. Of course school comes first. But if the school doesn't have a award or record for having the best grades in the region or state, the school could get some awards or records for sports. Lets say if a student is in football. The sport is very time consuming. The practices are everyday right after school for at least 3 hours. A school day is at least 6 to 8 hours a day. Now add the extra 3 hours for the football practice onto that. These kids are gone from their homes for at least 12 hours everyday. Teachers give at least 2 hours of homework. Do you really think that the football students will have enough time to study, do 2 hours of homework when they get home from a 12 hour day? If you change the policy to a B average, our team may not have many players. Its like this with every sport. Plus sports always have extra things the player shave to go to. Like something to raise money, sell stuff, banquets, camp for the sport. So with these extra things within the sport, it takes up almost there whole life. On the weekends, they want time to relax and be with friends they don't get to see often. Their not going to want to be doing homework. Then they will have no life

If you change the policy, our school will not have a lot of teams. I know that's kind of rude but, its true. If a person isn't interested in sports, they might join another activity, like for example the drama club. The drama club may not have a lot of plays but they work on each one for about 3 moths each. They would have practice all the time and keep good grades. It's actually good their still trying to be in school activities. If you take that away by having some of them not being able to participate, then the whole play will be ruined. When your doing a play, you need EVERYONE. The actors, director, set designers, understudies, writers, helpers, everyone. Without everyone, like I said before, most likely they wont be able to do the play. And if they can, then they would probably make it until the last minute.

So as you see, many students disagree with this idea. Especially, the athletes and club members. Do you want to make a bad decision for your school? Because I know I wouldn't. What if you wont be able to take back the new policy? Then a lot of students and couches and directors and staff members would be disappointed. You would have ruined your school. So just think about it

Sincerely,
