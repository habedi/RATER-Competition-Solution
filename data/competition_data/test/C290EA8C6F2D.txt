I agree with policy number one, that a student should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as it's off during class. Here are some reasons why.

The main reason i think this is the better choice is because, if you walk home and something happens you will need to me able to contact someone. If you weren't allowed to have phones on the compos then you wouldn't have your phone on the walk home. Also, if your walking alone you might want to call someone and talk to them while your walking home, just to make it less scary.

Another thing is, what if a family member is really sick and you want to be updated on how he or she is doing. If one of my family members were ill or hurt i would want to know what was going on every chance i could. That way if we could have out phones during lunch and other free times then you could ask your parents about them then. Instead of trying to sneak it during class and have the risk of getting it taken away. That brings me to my last reason.

The last thing i have to say about this is if we did get to have them out only at certain parts of the day no one would ever get caught or be worrying about it during class because they know that there will be time for them to look at it later on during the day. Plus, if you say that students aren't allowed to have there phones at all, that will just make them want to bring them even more.
