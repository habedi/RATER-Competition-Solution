A time without cars would be a very interesting idea, but now that almost everyone has a car some people think that it would be hard to seperate from them. So instead of completely sepereateing from them lets try to limit thier usage. Think of all the benifits not just for you for everyone. Most cars pollute the air we breath, things would be different because think of all the money you could save by not having to buy gas or another car, and also think of how lazy cars have made people today cities would improve if people just walked instead of driving to and from work.

We all know how unhealthy cars can be to the envirorment, but did you know it could get so bad it could really hurt people. according to Robert duffer paris had to place a ban on half of the cars because they had so much smog in thier city. "On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine" (Robert Duffer). he also said that diesel fuel was blamed and that it is worse than the normal gasoline. once a majority of the people had stayed off the roads for a while the smog eventually cleared up. So once agian this shows how harmful cars can be to an enviroment.

The reason america is having a drop in driven miles in the past years is that with the unemployment rate high and most americans can't afford cars. the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal has showed that since 2005 the number of miles driven has decreased and that the explanation of the recesssion is because of "cash-strapped americans could not afford new cars" (Elisabeth Rosenthal). Another statistic from the passage was that "the rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three yeas before the downturn"(Elisabeth Rosenthal). Even most middle class people have working cars some struggle to pay thier car payments and with the cost of gas high too they could really have a hard time.

Many people belive that the car is one of the main reasons that people today are as lazy as they are. just think if their were no cars everyone would get exersize by walking too and from work or the store. In Bogota Columbia parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Just because they have something called a car free day thisÂ  major event has inspired new bike paths and sidewalks throughout the city. and that was only a day out of the year and most of the people gladly participated. this was the third straight year of this event but it still goes on even when the rain is coming down people still want to be apart of events without cars.

Unfortunatly most people would only see the bad side of things if anyone tried to completley get rid of cars forever. But there are always a good side of things with anything including the car. The problems of polution, the expenses of the things you need to have to keep a car running or with you, and the fact that it help stop the laziness of some countrys and help make them look new.
