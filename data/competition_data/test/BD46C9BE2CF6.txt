In " The Challenge Of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its presents. And today i will evaluate how well the author supports his idea.

The author has supported evidence for his idea, and alot of it. The author tells us about how not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades . Those that have did not surivive the landing for more than a few hours. The author also talks about the envoriment on venus. telling us about all the dangerous air and how hot it is. And includes erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

he also supports the claim that it is worth while to study by talk about how it was once just like earth. the author tells us, and i quote: " long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth".

So there you have it. The author does a good job supporting making his claim and backing it up.
