In some countries such as France and Columbia they have car free days were you are not allowed to use your vehicle or you will be fined. Which is a very fair law considering if your country has high pollution rates or just too many cars on the road at once. If that became a law in the United States there would be widespread controversey but if the government provides transportation then it would make it better and you would be reducing pollution percentages.
