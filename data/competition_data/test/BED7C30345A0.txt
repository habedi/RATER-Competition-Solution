Are take home projects for students over summer vacation necessary? Yes, students should be given some sort of summer project that corresponds with their class for the following year. students spend roughly eight months in school and once summer comes all the academic knowledge they acquired over the school year is lost the day they walk out the school doors. students should stay in some sort of school environment so they do not fall behind or lose as much prior knowledge about the subject. students could connect with their teachers for the next academic school year and receive their project from them, to turn in the first week of school.

Many students need the extra summer project to keep them in the flow of things. Some students don't need the extra project they are always in a school mindset and keep there grades up. However, that is not the case for every individual student. A summer project would be no ones favorite summer activity but, it would benefit students for their next academic school year. therefore, students would already be in school mode and be more prepared and less likely to fail a semester due to lack of knowledge.

Students should be able to come up with their own creative idea whether it be for a science project or an English essay. Student would be more prone to do their work if they could do their own topic. Students would do topics that they are interested in, maybe a sport they play or the history of a vehicle they like. But, when students receive a prompt or a project of any kind they are not as interested as they could be if it was their own topic. The topics could be submitted to the students teachers to be approved prior to summer and starting the work.

It is necessary for students to receive a take home project or essay over the summer. It will keep students on their feet and in a school like environment. It will also build responsibility, and let your teachers know how dedicated you are to school or how important it is to you. Students would also have something to do over the summer, because most students sit around at home and do nothing but play video games and watch television. So yes, schools should send home summer projects and the students should be able to make a creative topic with his or her teachers approval.
