There are many ways you can do things without using cars as transportation. In these two sources, "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars," and "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota," they all explain how you can do things without have to use cars for transportation.

In the source, "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars," it explains that in Vauban, Germany, people have given up their cars to live a better, suburban life. In paragraph 3, Heidrun Walter states, "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." This shows that people can be happier living a suburban life by walking, riding bikes, etc. without having to use a car for transportation. Not only does has this made it easier, but has made the city denser.

In the source, "Car-free day is spinning intoa big hit in Bogota," it explains that in Bogota, Columbia, people started a campaign called Days Without Cars, which basically is supposed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This is a good way to lower air pollution and help make transportation a lot less stressful. In paragraph 20, it states, "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." This shows that without using cars for transportation, there will be less traffic jams and it will be easier to get to places.

In conclusion, people prefer to live a suburban life and use transportation without cars rather than with cars. This makes transportation a lot easier and you can get to places without being stressed out by traffic jams. This also keeps the country less poluted.
