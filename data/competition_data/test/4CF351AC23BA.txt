I think if students were able to attend classes from home there grades would be better because you would be able to focus more. There wouldnt be other students around to bring your grade down because there failing also kids focus more when there's no teacher around because they feel more comfortable.

In my option it would cost less drama because other people wouldnt be with you to cause problems. because when you get in trouble you have to deal with the principle and you will most likely get suspended.

Also you wouldnt have to wake up at 6:00 AM every morning because its so stressful to wake up that early every day. Because if u wake up mad you're not gonna wanna do anything at school. If i were able to control if we had to work from home i would do it because everything you do online is better because you can go back and check you stuff you don't have any body rushing. You and when u make videos for the class instead of presenting to the whole class because if you make a video you can mess up as many times as you want. But the thing is you are able to start over, rather than having to present to the class and mess up in front of everybody when you mess up in front of other people it is embarrassing.

If you are taking classes at home you will be able to eat what you want. Because the school food is nasty and unhealthy and sometimes you go half of the day with out eating and everybody knows you cant focus on a empty stomach. So if decide to eat you can leave in the middle of a test and come back and finish if your taking the class at home.

In conclusion, theses are the reasons i think students should be able to stay home and do classes everything would be so much easier for them and if all the students. Make it and pass they would thank the county for letting them take online classes and they wouldn't be showing up late because you can lay in bed and do your online classes if you really wanted to dont forget it would be less drama two because drama messes up your school work after all this the reasons i think students should be able to take online classes.
