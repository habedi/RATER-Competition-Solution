Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it causes unneeded stress, it takes time away from studying, and it leads to injuries. Why cant we just have the student attend class as usual. They can always sign up if they think they're up for the challenge. Imagine a young straight A girl signing up for lacrosse, she ends up loving it but at what cost? Now she has to practice everyday after school instead of studying, Then she got a C on the test. Now she broke her wrist and is struggling to take notes in class, see what this leads to?

Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it causes unneeded stress. When a person is stressed out it is hard for them to concentrate on another topic because theyre so worried on what's stressing them out. The same goes for students. when they're sitting at their desk working on an assignment it's almost impossible to concentrate when they're thinking about something else. That can lead to late or missing assignments that cause their grade to lower. When a student is in an extracurricular activity they also have assignments they need to work on whether its improving a move in sports or writing a speech for debate they have to work on that as well as their assignments from class.

Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they will have less time to study. If student cant study as long it will also bring down their grade which, no one wants. When in an extracurricular activity it isn't rare to have to work with a partner. When you work with another person you have to change your schedule to cooperate with theirs. It can also be very frustrating if they dont like each other. Some extracurricular activities leave during class which can cause a disruption in the classroom, and makes the student miss the work or notes during the time of their ascents.

Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it can lead to injuries. If they join a sport they could hurt their arms, legs, and even head. Those injuries are very hard to deal with while in school, and make it even harder to focus and succeed. Its not just if you are apart of a sport it could also be stuff such as theater arts, or debate. In those you have to move around furniture or props which could lead to an injury. When a student has an injury they might have to miss a couple days of school and have to catch up. They could also have a hard time moving around the school and writing.

Student shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because it causes unneeded stress that distracts from learning, it takes times away from studying which can lower their grades, and they can get injuries that make it more challenging to concentrate and learn to the best of their abilities. If we force students to join an extracurricular activity then we are just hurting them when we should be making them stronger. We cant let students suffer so we need to fight to insure this never happens.
