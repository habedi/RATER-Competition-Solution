Technology is advancing at a rapid rate and is consuming our lives. With the new software created by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, computers are now able to recognize human emotion. This technology can be useful for various things. The software can make video games more realistic, it can give more insight on psychology, and it can even be useful in classrooms.

Often, children in classrooms do not understand certain things, but may be too shy to ask questions. With the emotion recognition, teachers will be able to tell who is understanding the topic and who is struggling. Another way the software can be helpful to classrooms is that if it shows a child is upset about something, but tries not to show it, that may be a clue that they're struggling with something outside of class. When a child is in a bad state, they will most-likely not try in their classes, but if a teacher could talk to them and help them, it could be a good way to get the child to vent and relieve the pressure from themselves, causing their grades to go up. Lastly, the software can help teachers notice bullying. Many times kids get let off the hook for bullying someone because, "they were just kidding around", "we're buddies", but that is not really the truth. If the emotional recongition software is installed in schools, teachers will be able to notice if a kid out of a group of people is feeling uncomfortable while the other kids are laughing. Stopping each of these problems will allow the children to make better grades, be less stressed, and hopefully enjoy school.

Technology is a big piece of this generation and it has come a long way and has helped society a lot. The advancements in them are drastic and they continue to become more useful to society. The emotional recognition software can help make many impacts on this world to make it become a nicer place. Using the software in classrooms would be an awesome start.
