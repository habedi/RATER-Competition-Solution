Dear Senator,

In the year 2000, a great injustice was made in our country.  The president who the people voted for was unfairly defeated because of the electoral college.  Our government says that it is by the people and for the people, but the electoral college is against this whole ideal.  The electoral college is unfair, undemocratic, and outdated.

To begin with, the electoral college is unfair because we aren't actually voting for the president, which is a constitutional right.  We are voting for a group of people, who by human nature, have their own opinions and agendas.  It is quite possible that they would go against us and vote differently like the 2000 election.

In addition, the electoral college is not democratic.  The people, who are supposed to decide who becomes president, are in fact, not deciding at all.  The voters are a piece of unnecessary government.  The popular vote should always be the way presidents are chosen according to the constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

Finally, the electoral college is a very outdated idea.  Maybe, in our country's beginning when people didn't have media or fast-traveling news, it may have been a good idea to have informed voters, but now, everyone has the chance to be informed.  Our country doesn't need an electoral college because we can think for ourselves.

Thank you,

PROPER_NAME.
