Why you shouldn't change the policy to do any athletic activities

Dear Principal,

I'm against the policy because you should at least have a C average to be able to play any athletic activities because if you have C average or anything lover than a C average but you really want to tryout for an athletic activity but you need a B average it's not fair so you should make it at least you should have C average or anything lower in all your classes. So you should be able to do an athletic activity even though a student or students have an average lower than a B average. And it gives kids something to do after school instead of going straight home and playing video games everyday.

So if you make it so that you have to have a B average to play any sports then its just not fair and a lot of people would be pretty upset if they couldn't play any sports just because they have a C, D, E, or F average because they gain a lot from playing sports like more energy to get them through the day, more strength to be able to do more things, and it keeps them healthy. So I hope you can change the policy and let kids play sports even though they have an average lower than a B average.

In conclusion, remember this kids should be able to play any sport no matter what the average because it's just unfair.
