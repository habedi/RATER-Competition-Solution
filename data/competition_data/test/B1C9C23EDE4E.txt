It takes about 30 minutes to get to school by walk from my home. In fact, 78% of high school students spend more than an hour in the morning even they go to school by their car, or school buses. Consequently, school principal demonstrated about the new class policies that students take the class in home by the video conferencing. Although some people might say being able to attend class from home is better to students, students should take the class in the school because they interact with their classmate, teacher, and friends in the school, and students are able to experience various activities.

There is some valid argument that taking the class in online is beneficent to students. The critics say, students have to spend a lot of time to reach to school in the morning. They wake up at 6:00 a. m. in the morning and ride the bus at 7:00 a. m.. Students required to sleep at least 7 hours to be active and for their health. However, it is unavailable because they have much of works: homework, quiz, and test.Â Students need to study for these things until they have confident for that, so they might stay up or sleep after 12 a. m.. Another purpose of this is that students can review clearly what they learn as they record the class. In the video conferencing, it is possible to record the lecture; recording the class in the school is impossible. Finally, students can be more brave and active in the class, for they don't need face out each face. Ultimately, this argument is invalid because online class can cause a lack of attendance, and students may not concentrate for the class.

On the other hands, students should require to take the class in the school. For example, students contact with their classmate, friend, and teacher in the school. They can make the friend in the school and develop their personal relationships. In addition, people can cheat or cannot concentrate if they take the online class. Most of researches and answer might be in the internet; they might think they don't have to study. Furthermore, Students can participate tremendous activities in the school: labs, Socratic seminar, projects, and festivals. Therefore, this argument is valid because not only experience various things during the class, but also students are able to do extracurricular activities after school.

In conclusion, because students interact with their colleagues, teacher, and friend in the school, and they are able to experience tremendous activities, students should take the class in the school. Solving this problem will mean that taking the class in the school provide more various education, exercises, and experience small society in the world with people.
