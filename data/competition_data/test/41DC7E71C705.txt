Back in 1976 an image was captured by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In that time technology wasn't as good as it is now. So the so called Face started to spread quickly. Many people thought that this was created by aliens.

Now first of all aliens haven't been proved real yet, so if aliens aren't real then how can people say aliens did it. In the first image taken in 1976 I can understand why people are creating theories. But if you look at the one taken in 2001 you can clearly see that it is a mesa. Even in 1998, when technology was advancing, you can still see that it is a mesa or just even a type of landform.

Like Garvin says "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," and I agree with him completely. I bet if we looked now with the technology we have with could see little rocks on the ground because our country is so advanced in technology. Since we don't see Cydonia alot because we don't pass very often , I don't see us seeing the Face for quite a while.
