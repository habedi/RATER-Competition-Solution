To start off I see electorcal college as a bad thing... Not for one reason For many reasons but the main one is that its unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all-system in each state. Anther Reason is because canidates dont spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning. Abd there only fucosing only on tight races in the "siwng" states.

And plus its unfair, outdated, and last irrational...

Reason i say that is because it doesnt give no chance for us to find our right leader and to me you need to be fair with your voters and need to have the right president for your country. So he could do smart decisions for your people and state... And plus i disagree wuth this system because am in the democratic side of the hole system. And the Electorcal College is not democratic method of selecting a president that ought be overuled... In otherwords it is the electors that choose the president not the people. And to me theres no point of voting because if you cant oick what you want then whats the point of even trying to vote.

And your not voting for president your voting for the state of electors so they could choose the president for you... But the only thing positive thing that i see that each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee. But there are many rataining things about the Electrol College that you may not or may know about but i think i need to tell you... Its a lack of democratic pedigree, all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. What am trying to say with this hole thing its that it doesnt fucos on the people as much as it should.

And the Electorcal College method of selecting the president may turn off alot of voters that are intrested in voting or taking place in our country, or just has no hope of carrying there state. For example Demorcrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. There votes will not be effected. Reason being because they have less incentive to pay attention to the compaign than most of them would have if the president were picked by the popular vote... But lets face it non voters swings in a national election, and in spite pf that, about one-half of the American population did vote in 2012 election. So if you think about it, it was only succesful during 2012 or maybe a little before that...

And another negative thing about the Electoral College with the Big states that might really get your attention is that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance so that means large states have lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decrease in the Constition.. For example the popular vote in Florida was very close.  Obama who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. So that means a victory for him... But the one good thing about it is that the larger states get more attention then the smaller states do.

Well to end this letter I want to say i disagree with keeping Electoral College and those were the reasons... Hope you get to read what i got to say and i Hope I make a change about this issue.
