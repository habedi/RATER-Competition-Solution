You may wonder why you haven't seen people using their cars lately. This is because those citiznes have realized the advantages of limited car usage. There are many valid reasons why using a car is not the way to go when it comes to transportation.

In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article "...Life Goes on Without Cars" she talks to Heidrun Walter who has amited to the fact "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," citizens become happier when they aren't using a car as a way of transportation. Life without cars can make you happier, isn't that what everyone want - to be happy? And this is just one way to do so.

There are more advantages to limited car usage than you think. We prevent smog "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..." We all hate how annoying smog can be, so all we have to do is the stop using cars as much and we won't see the thing we hate anymore. Even if you think that your city will only be prevented from smog, others will as well.

While there are disadvantages to the fact of not having a car, but isn't there more advantages to not having an Earth to live on? That's right, if we treat the Earth like we are now and using cars so much out "home" will be destroyed all thanks to humans like us. In Robert Duffer's article about smog bans he states "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city", so if we take the example of Paris we can stop pollution and prevent losing our home.
