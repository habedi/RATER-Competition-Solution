"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curisoty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." The author of the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his idea well by giving details on what challenges Venus gives, reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet, and plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications.

The author presents details as to why Venus is a challenge to explore by giving descriptions on its envrionment. In paragraph 3, the article states "...Venus has the hottest surface temperature on any planet in our solar system..." and "...planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit..." These statements provide a sensory detail of why humans aren't able to withstand the conditions of Venus, because it is extremely hot for us to withstand. Another example is, "...Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface." This demonstrates the complication as to why spacecrafts have a hard time landing on Venus to explore, which is weather and environmental factors impose a threat to damaging the spacecraft.

The author in the article helps support his idea by giving reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet Venus. In paragraph 4, it states "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." This examines why scientists are curious on exploring the planet because if it has been the most Earth-like planet it "...could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth," as stated in the fourth paragraph. Another example is "...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." This exclaims that since Venus is not that far away to travel to compared to other planets, it cuts down space travel time which is beneficial to humans since they cannot live hundreds of years.

The author continues to supports his ideas by proposing plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications. In paragraph 5, it says "... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." This example provides information on how a hovering vehicle would help astronauts to avoid the environmental factors making it easier to explore Venus by aerial view. In paragraph 7, it states "Another project is looking back to an old techonology called mechanical computers... these devices make calculations by using gearws and levers and do not require electronics at all." This example helps exancuate on how old technology can help collect data on Venus by being able to be more resistent to its conditions compare to modern technology that is delicate.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagnication and innovation. The author highlighted points as to why Venus would be a difficult planet to explore, but expunds on the solutions and inspirations why its a worthy pursuit. The author exclaimes his points by giving details on what challenges Venus gives, reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet, and plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications.
