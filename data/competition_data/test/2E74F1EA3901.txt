The author has a good point. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. It is believe that it was covered with large oceans and supported forms of life, however various spacecrafts only survived several hours when landing on Venus.

First off, Venus still has Earth-like features. The planet has a rocky surface and includes valleys, mountains, and craters. However the temperature on Venus surface averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it is said that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. So why is it believed that life once existed on this planet? It is extremely dangerous to send anyone to Venus, because they most likely wouldn't make it back home. Let alone survive a couple hours. The author stated that NASA is working on other ways to study Venus without risking the lives of others. Which I believe is a good idea. It'll spark more people's interest in knowing the plants around us.

Despite the dangers Venus has eventually NASA will find a way to successfully send a spacecraft or group of people up there without doing any harm. Even though life today cannot exist on Venus because of the tempature and air quality, it is worth looking into.
