I would agree that we school have students participate in sports,work on the yearbook,and serve on the students council..Like if people want to play sports they can,if people want to play football,soccer,etc they can. Let just say if someone wants to play a sport they need to sign a paper to make sure if your child gets hurt you don't sue the school. People sometimes want to work on the yearbook like make the front othe book and then puting the pictures of the students. If you want to workon the yearbook you have to make sure you have the best drawing skills and writting because if you don't have the skills then the yearbook wont look good for the school. But sometimes they have a compition on who has the best drawing of the school yearbook. Also you can be a student council for a day that means you can help out in the office like make sure everything is okay you also help by helpng the teachers that are in the office like with reports other students. This can help you by feeling helpfull and if you want to become a teacher they can help you with that to. So i agreed to this because in some way foortball,working on the yearbook,and help in the council can help you and in your futrue. Like football you can become the best football player,working on the yearbook can make you a better artist,and working in the council can help you with comunication and helping others.
