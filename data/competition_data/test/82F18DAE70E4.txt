Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that students should be required to do community service. It will help them learn how to work, teach them responsibility, and help students get into a good college.

Community service would help students learn and have experience in working. For example, if somebody liked animals they could volunteer at the animal shelter and they would be able to say, when applying for a job, that they have experience. Also, it will help them learn more about the are they are interested in.

Community service will also teach students responsibility. For example, when they make mistakes they will learn to take responsibility for them and to deal with the consequences. Also, it will let them get a feeling of what it is like to have people relying on them and, therefore, putting more responsibility on them.

Many colleges look for students who do a lot of community service. Some now have made it a requirement and students will not be able to get into them without it. If the school doesn't provide it, then the students will feel like it is not an obligation and will end up with less choices in college and, ultimately, jobs.

I think your school will benefit a lot from adding in a community service program. It will teach them how to work, take responsibility, get them into a good college, and, in the long run, make them better students.

Thank you for your time and I hope you will honestly consider putting community service into our school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
