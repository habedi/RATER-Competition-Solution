Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you to discuss about community service in our school. I think it is a great idea to make it mandatory. To make people at our school do community work would help out our community as well as our school. I think It would make the students at our school become better people.

Community work is a great form of helping out your town. Students already should be doing community work even if it is not mandated. This will help not only me but the school, students going into high school or college would get this on there record and it would make a good impression on the school you wish to go to.

By performing this service we are making not only our town a better place but the world. Liter has been a big problem in the United States and we can help it. Even if some students don't know what they are doing when they pick up one piece of liter it is helping the world to become a better place .

I just want you to think of this issue and give it consideration in our school. You will see the development in our students by solving this issue.
