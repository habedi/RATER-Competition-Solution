Dear Principal,

As for the decision of the cell phone policy, the first policy would be the better option. There would be too many distractions and even cheating on educational work.

When students are in public in the school, areas such as libraries, a cell phone ring would be very disrupting and at some points irritating. People trying to concentrate on their studies would have a harder time with the disruption.

During their free periods, the students could or would be communicating with other students while these students are working in classrooms. This would be very disruptive to these students and teachers alike. The students could be passing answers for tests and class work. Students could even be communicating with students at different schools or other adults. The same could apply to students using their cell phones during their lunch periods. It would not be fair for a student to be improperly judged by the use of other people's knowledge.

The cell phones could also be used to communicate improper behavior or in other words, start fights or other wrong doings during the school day.

Overall, the decision to ban the use and possession of cell phones at school would be the best decision. There could be too many negative outcomes for the student body because of the use of cell phones. As long as there is cell phones, there could be cheating and unfair actions. The possibility for distraction in school would be too great.

Sincerely,
