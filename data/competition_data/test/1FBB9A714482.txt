"The Challenge of Exploring Venus," says much about the challenge, and how we might be able to study Venus, but says little comparatively of why we should. The article only talks about why we should study Venus only once in the fourth paragraph out of eight others. Paragraph four mentions how Venus may have been like Earth, "it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." and how it is the nearest planet to Earth, "Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be out nearest option for a planetary visit,". However, these claims it makes are not enough reason to study Venus, they fall short of balancing out the risk with the reward. When you consider what the paragraph says it becomes obvious that with high risk, ineffective solutions, and lacking reasons for study this article misses the mark and doesn't support the worth of studying Venus as well as it aims to.
