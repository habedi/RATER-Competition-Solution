Potentially you would think OH GREAT DRIVERLESS CARS! But these cars aren't completely driverless as mentioned in paragraph 7 and the bad thing is you really don't know how great its' manufactured mentioned in paragraph 9 for these reasons im out. There are many negatives as well as positives the positives include so many great things like you have this car driving all by its self to a certain extent, we have all these cars in the time that has passed by and a sensor is one of the oldest safety tools we have used since the 1980's as seen in paragraph 5 and prices are sky high in 2016 so some people may not be able to aford these smart cars wheres all the safety they so called want its' more in favor of money regardless if your real goal is to be safe or not because these cars are the next step to a new generation. If you think it's cheap to build and program a smart car you have another thing coming because it takes many years to develope the idea anyway so thats including every financial risk the people who developed this car would be dirt poor if they werent approved or make enough money to finance all of the product for the car such as the newer Kias have beats systems installed in them which we all know the headphones are 300 dollars a pop so how much is it to be installed in the cars? I dont exactly have an answer for that but it should be figured pretty easily either its commercialized or they payed a lot and commercialized to have this product in their cars. Now back to the smart driverless cars like i said there are positives to this which include the ones that work right and all the safety they contain if you relax and still watch the road you can have a nice conversation with your family and not feel so pressured or rushed and as said in paragraph 5 the sensors i mentioned at the beginning are developing drastically as the years go by in just 10 short years which may seem like a long time but in that time the creation of antilock breaks was born and it only progressed from there with each sensor made a new idea came along and with each car that progressed people just want more but ask your self are you for or against? and is this smart car thing really a good idea?
