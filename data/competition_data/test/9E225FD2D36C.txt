My opinion on if students should be aloud to bring cell phones to school is yes because, there are many problems that may occur on school grounds, for example: There could be an actual terrorist in the school, and we need to call your parents and tell them that our school has been force to be on lockdown. Another reason why students should be aloud to have cell phones in school is because, during lunch periods the way we talk in lunch is the way that we would be talking/texting on a cell phone. I'm pretty sure that all of the after school sports players bring their cell phones to school to tell their parents if they have practice or if a game has been canceled.

A third reason why students should have the right to bring cell phones in school is in case of a blackout. If there was a blackout at school the only way a student could reach their parents to tell them that they are okay is if they brought their cell phones to school.

The last reason why students should be aloud to bring their cell phones to school is for after school activities, if your mother forgets to pick you up from an activity then how are you going to call her if you don't have you're phone? Yes you can use the office phone but, what if there's a long line and you have to leave the school at that very moment or you wouldn't be eligible go to anymore after school activities? That would be very upsetting. In conclusion I hope by reading my very thoughtful reading you understand why i believe 100% that students should be aloud to bring phones to school in a respectful manner.
