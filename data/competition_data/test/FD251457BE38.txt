Dear Principle,

Helping around the community is an important part of life. This task helps an individuals develop well-balanced human characteristics. The lessons taught in school are remembered from the rest of ones life and should impact a child's thoughts. Therefore, forcing students to help their community will provide thoughtful human-beings that will create a better universe.

A well-balanced student creates thoughtful and loving leaders of the future. To have a variety of good characteristics produces kind people. Wouldn't the world be wonderful if everyone loved one another? These characteristics of thoughtfulness, kindness, patience, and so on led to no one being hurtful to anyone. If everyone could love, and be patient with each other the society would improve a great deal. Forcing the students of one school to get out in their community would create these human characteristics in the students.

The world around us is in need of much help. The global warming is taking over, and the oceans are just not what they use to be. If everyone would just take a little time out to help, this universe would be impacted greatly. The world needs to be saved and we need to take the first steps. These students at this school can be the ones to start with a little push from the administration.

Helping around the community changes the world and will produce a better atmosphere for our own children. Instead of slowly killing the universe around us, we should be stepping up and producing a better living society. Students can not quite grasp this idea all by themselves quite yet, therefore you need to step in.

Thank You,

Your student
