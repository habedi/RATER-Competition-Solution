Dear: Principal

I think you should not require this because we need it here are some example an reason why I think this:

RELATIVE_NAME was a average student that had A' s B' s and a C. One day he was on his ways to basketball practice when his coach told him he couldn't play no more. Shocked RELATIVE_NAME asked him why? His coach said that he needed to get higher than a C to be able to play sports. The next day the school lost more than half of their sports players. That year SCHOOL_NAME couldn't participate in any games. Just like him there is other going through the same thing in school. That's why I think the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.

My first reason why I think that principal should not require a B or higher to play sports is that even if kids have a C they are trying. Its not fair for others who don't even care about it and decided to flunk. Just because of them their going to take a privilege away from everybody. He should just have a talk with the players of every sport. That way kids who don't want to be in it can get out and do better in school. Kids need to exercise daily. Having too much homework can prevent them from going outside and play. That why i think principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.

Another reason is why I think principal should not require a B or higher to play sports is because kids need to learn how to work in teams. It can help them some how in their life. learning to get along with other people could lead them to a good future. For example if you're looking for a job and you get the one you like, but there is another person working with you that you didn't get along in school. You are not just going to quit your dream job. You can talk to them and solve the problem and you can work peacefully with them.

My last reason why i think the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports is because many kids get in it to get better at it, or to face their fears. Bullies are teasing other kids just because their not strong. That's not good for them. it makes them feel bad. If they join sports it might help them. Knowing that everything the bullies say is not true. But if they get a C on some subject they won't be able to keep their self-confidence. that's why i think the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.

People say that by joining sports students do bad in school. That's not true. There is a lot of other thing that are keeping the student to complete the assignments. Playing video games, doing chores, its not just because they joined a sport in school. In fact that help them do better in school. If they like what they are doing and they know you need to have a C or above to stay in the team. They are working hard to do good in school.

The principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.

Many kids need it. There is a lot of reasons why kids join sports. To build up confidence. To learn how to work in a team and get along with others. Just because they want to do something active. It doesn't matter why but i thin that the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.

Sincerely:

A Student of your school
