Some students think that they should design their assigned summer projects, but they are wrong. If students designed what their summer projects were they would be helpless. There are many downsides to student-designed projects. They would have to provide themselves with supplies; rather, if their teacher designed the project, they may of have had provided supplies. Students would not have any assistance or encouragement from their teachers if they were to design the summer project themselves. Teachers should always design summer projects.

Firstly, students should not design their own summer projects because they would be confused and clueless. They would be confused because they would have to develop their own ideas on what the project should be. The development of projects are a process. Teachers would have to come up with a layout of what the students should do, if they should work independently or with a group, and even if they want the students to do a presentation on the assignment. The process a teacher goes through to make not just projects, but also assignments, is stressful. For example, I once was helping one of my teachers develop a project for her class. There were many steps that had to be completed before the assignment was finalized. The steps included the entire idea of the project, the items that the students had to complete for full credit, and also the grading scale. If students had a choice on designing their summer projects, they would be too stressed out they would not have any time to relax.

Secondly, most teachers provide supplies for their students to complete their projects. If students designed their own summer projects, they would have to provide themselves with the supplies they need. When students have to provide themselves with supplies, it removes money that could have been spent on something else. When teachers supply their students the products they need, it is very helpful for the students. If a student was at their house with no supplies, they would have to go buy some; however, if the teacher designed the project, the supplies would have been free and easy accessible. Teacher-designed projects are helpful to a student in need of supplies.

Lastly, if a student designed their own project they would have no assistance from the teacher on what the project was, what the idea of the project should be, or even how to start the project. Most of the time, students have many questions to ask about summer projects before school ends. Students may not be able to do that if they were to design the project themselves. A student may need help on deciding how to start the project before school ends, and the teacher would be able to answer. If the student designed the project and had no idea what to start the project about, they would be extremely stressed out about a summer project. The teacher should be able to encourage the student if they design the project.

In conclusion, I think teachers should design their own projects to their students. If a student has stress on them about developing a project, they would have no time to enjoy the summer. If a student designed their own project, they would not know how to develop the outline of the project, which is the starting or basic all around sections of the project. Most teachers supply students with products that can be used on their projects; consequently, if a student designed a project for themselves over the summer, they would have to provide themselves with supplies. Also student-designed projects have no teacher assistance. Especially over the summer, students have no contact with their teacher. Students should not design their own summer projects. To all teachers, keep up the good work!
