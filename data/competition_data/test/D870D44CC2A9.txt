Dear TEACHER_NAME:

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I'm in the 7th grade and I have heard about the requirements for sports activities. I feel a 3.0 gpa is hard for some of us at this school to achieve. Most of the population at our school is mainly passing with a 2.5 gpa or just a average C. Taking away activities like this will make us students eventually fall under the wrong crowd. Sports are way to help us stay out of trouble when were not here at school on campus.

Most students love to do the activities you offer here as well as the after school tutoring programs to offer. Maybe with students with a C average should be required to attend after school tutoring three times a week. If you don't make a adjustment for the sports programs, not that many students are going to show up. For some students sports are the best things their good at. At least we try to pass. Why would you want to take away the only thing most kids are good at. Believe me, we can make your sports program better than all the other middle schools here in our district.

Sincerely;

STUDENT_NAME
