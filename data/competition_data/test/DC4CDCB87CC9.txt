If it were me, I wouldn't have technology to read students' emotional expressions. That would be very creepy and computers break down all the time. Let a computer get a virus see what happens... It's just a mistake waiting to happen.

People should use technology to better our education services and fix up the hoods. Those would be better causes. Another great cause that technology could be used in is to invest in disease cures and control. Those four things would benefit the United States tremendously with our technology in this day and age behind it. Now on the other hand, using this technology to read students' emotional expressions would be successful, but it is also an invasion of privacy and wouldn't really benefit the World or let alone this Country in comparision to some of the other things i mentiontioned.

Me personally i dont feel like it would be a good investment. I feel like there are better things that you can use technology foroppose to reading somebody's mind. Although, it does have it's benefites.... It is not something that i would look into. It's a invasion in privacy. I just feel that its creepy and if a kid is going to talk to you about something he will!
