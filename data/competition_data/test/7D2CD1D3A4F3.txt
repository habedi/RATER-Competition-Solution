Most kids don't like school as it is and its boring to them. The student-designed summer project would be better in their favor Because studens don't get to say much besides ask questions, and They have more say and more of a voice, and not every student learns the same, and summer is better than the school year because you can do more outside activities.

The project would be great for students to learn and have fun because you can do things like have a lessons with the activities where the kids can pick between thing because not all kids like everything to be just told to them. kids feel better when they can have fun and everything isn't crammed in their brains for 7 hours a day. Which would make them tired and not ready to learn. This would be perfect for students who are hands on type of learners. They can be hands on because the project is student based. Not every kid learns the same so kids who learn differently would be more comfortable because its not a 7 hour classroom environment where they just sit in class all day.

Student would have more say or more of a voice because is about them.

During the school year in the fall and winter because the teacher basically run the class and they teach they way they want and the kids just listen. By making the project student based students can present thier feelings and their feedback about what they like and don't like. It can also help teacher get a better undestanding about their students. They can also create bonds with new people such as students and teachers. Nobody want to be taught by a teacher they don't like. This will cause kids not being motivated to learn from the teacher and will probably cause bad behavior.

The project willalso make kid have more fun and they'll probably like school. You can do more activies that kids will like, like going to the pool, or planning a picnic, or just playing on a playground. You could make it so that it could be a lesson in each activity. Then they will learn while having fun. It wold be a win for everyone. It can just belittle insintives that they can get because of the weather and little brain breaks so they dont get overwelmed. Students already don't like going to school and making it fun and in their favor will make them want to come.

In conclusion students would overall like the summer project that is student designed over teacher disigned because not every student learns the same, students get more of a voice which means they get to pick between things they like, and school is just better in the summer because of the outside activities you can do.
