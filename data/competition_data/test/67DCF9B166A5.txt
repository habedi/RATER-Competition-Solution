Should or shouldn't students participate in an extracurricular

?",well I think that they should participate in an extracurricular because they can earn points or things for participating in these things, having something to do in their spare time, supporting the school and making it better for the students to be there, not to be having a very free scheulcle becuase they could be playing sports and maybe they would make it into the NFL or other sports related things.

Therefore, students could be having a free period doing nothing. Instead they could be doing something in there mean time and doing a interesting circular. For them wanting to do a extracurricular, my idea would be having to have them write on a piece of paper saying what they would mostly want to be doing for a extracurricular. After that we would pick the most wrote extracurriclar to do and giving everyone 1 week vote for which curricular they want and then we give would them that activity to do for a whole 2 semester.

For the student council and yearbook club, they would each have specific job. Yearbook kids would have a limited amount of kids because everyone would need to have a skill that helps them get done with the yearbook. This is why becuase they want to be walking around doing nothing with the camera. Student councils would be having a specific job to do like having to be controlling the announcement and deciding should they should they not have dress code.

Therefore students are needed to be payed attention to and have an opinion because they can all hate the school and not having to make they're own decision. They should have a choice to be choosing between what they love and being free to be doing there favorite thing to do. There is a error that would be coming through because sometimes they're friends would want to be doing the something that there friends are but if there friend s doesnt like it they can change it for themselves. Sometimes younger people doesnt like doing anything but just them a change for having to do something they like to do. Myself doesnt like doing extracurricular but I still have to do it. Some of them might be doing but you have to put a smile on your face to be saying that you are enjoying it.
