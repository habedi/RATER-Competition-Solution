The author describes how a new technology called, "The Facial Action Coding System," (FACS), enables computers to identify human emotions, by describing the software used at the University of Illinois. I believe this type of technology is a great way to read students' emotional expressions for not only educational use but for human interactions.

FACS would be put into great use of technology for students' due to the amount stress, and confussion students' may be recieving, while doing assignments or assessments. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." (6) This type of technology, could provide a tutor to appear on the screen, and help the student with anything they are in need of. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." (6) This may also result in ways students may accumulate these skills during musicals or plays.

Another way FACS could be used, is for human interactions. This may be useful for: family matters, employment, interviews, meeting someone. "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles." (3) This can help tell the person whether they are happy, sad, confused, dishonest, etc. and give the person a way to respond to the situation such as a lie. "To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot whena a "smiling" polotician or celebrity isn't being truthful." (8)

In concluding my arguement as to why I agree with the type of technology, FACS, are due to the use for educational purposes such, as being confused on a assignment or assessment, and the use for human interactions whether it is on employment, interviews, meeting someone, or family matters.
