As a student who attends a public school, I have noticed that everyone has different accommodations for their needs. I believe it is important to take into consideration of these needs and act upon them so that everyone can be satisfied in their environment. One example that has come to my attention is distance learning. Distance learning is basically school from home, either online or through video conferencing. Schools that offer distance learning could benefit students, as there are many people who siuffer from mental health issues and physically cannot attend school. However, students could easily take advantage of this opportunity through cheating.

Mental health issues are a worldwide problem that are not easy to escape. I happen to be good friends with someone who has a slightly extreme case of Lymes Disease that affects her mental health on a daily basis, and makes it very hard for her to get out of bed each day and attend school. She rarely came to school enough to finish her sophomore year. In response to this, the administration gave her the opportunity to attend school through a computer screen, which benefited her just as much as anyone who physically attends school. It benefitted her by giving her the chance to learn everyday from her bed, and it was easier on her mental health.

Although there are many benefits to online school, there are also negative factors that play into it. As I mentioned earlier, students could easily take advantage of this opportunity through cheating. Yes, this could benefit an individual because then maybe they would be getting good grades, but in the long run they are only hurting themselves. Schools provide long distance education so that they can take into consideration of every ones needs, not to give students a chance to cheat.

In conclusion, distance learning could certainly benefit the students who truly need it, as it provides easy access to learning from home. If one were to decide to do online school, I believe the schools administration should see if that person really needs it to their benefit, or if they just want the chance to do it to take advantage of it. There are many people in this world who have different accommodations to satisfy their needs, and if online school is granted to them they should take the opportunity of it to their benefit.
