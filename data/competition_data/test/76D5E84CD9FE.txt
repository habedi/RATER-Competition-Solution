Have you ever though about what Venus is like? In the story the author talks what we could do to see what Venus looks like. Are sister planet is truely a mystery Although some people whould say it is a waste of time, it is important because it could prove there was it is like there, it could have highly benifical materials, it would prove we can do it.

there is a problom with us get there and stay there for mor than a second. We do not know much about the land but there are mountains, caverns, and volcanoes. The weather is not very good ether there are frequant lightning storms and powerful earthquakes. The atomosphere is high crosive in the clouds at least.

With the pressure of Venus below sea level there is no dought there is new materials there. The entire ground is made up of sedimant rocks that can with stand the sulfic acid. If we could get some it would be easyer to go there and last alot longer. This how ever would be extremly difficult because we need something that could withstand it to get it and come back.

Some Astronimers and scientists just want to prove thay can do it. everyone is working together to make this happen. The failure will not stop some people it will just drive them to do it even more. They may do it just to due it but all around they just will do what ever it takes.

There are reasons to do go to Venus to prove we can or even to help benefit are technology. No matter what we will not stop until we do it we will never give up. now there is only one thing left and that wis one thing. will you be the generation who will compete this challange?
