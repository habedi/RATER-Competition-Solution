The face on Mars is not an alien artifact. I believe it is just a landform, and here's why, there has been photos that have been taken since the original 1976 photo that said that it was a face. What the 2001 photo has shown us is that it is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte or a mesa are common around the American West. JIm Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program had said that it "eminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars." Secondly, I believe that it is a landform because NASA has photographed this photo more than once to determine if it was an alien atrifact and after their second trip to Cydonia, they had enough information to say it is a martian landform. So in 1998, they had waited nearly eighteen years since the first photos of the face. The research crew took a new photo of the face that is ten times sharper than the 1976 photo. When it was released to the public, it had turned out to be a natural landform, not an alien monument. Lastly, I believe it is a nautral landform because in the 2001 photo of the landform, the Mars Global Surveyor took a new photo of the face using the camera's maximum resolution "Each pixel spanned 1.56 meters, while the 1976 photo had spanned 43 meters. So, this abolishes the possibility of it being an alien artifact because if there were any egyptian style pyramids you would have been able to see them" These are the facts that I believe determine that the face on mars is just a landform and not an alien artifact.
