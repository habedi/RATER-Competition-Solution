We are all human beings. We all have some different opinions and some same opinions. The interesting debate was about the Face on Mars. I am here to tell you that the Face is just a natural landform.

I have reasons to why the Face is just a natural landform. First, aliens are not scientificly proven to be real. Therefore, the Face could not have been an alien artifact. Second, the face appear that a person is inside the moon trying to come out and that is impossible for someone to be inside the moon. Finally, no one could have been to Mars and created that Face because it would be stated on the Internet on who created it.

There are numberous of evidence of why the Face is just a natural landform. First, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos revealing it as a natural landoform. In addition, the camera that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo of using the camer's absolute maximum resolution. Futhermore, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compare to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Finally, the picture that Malin's team capture showed that it is Martina's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

Others say that the Face on Mars was not a Martian's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms. Some people believed that it was from an alien artiface. Others like conspiracy theorists said the evidence that NASA would rather hide.

There are reason why the Face on Mars was just a natural landform. This eassy helps you to rethink your thoughts of what it really is. There are logoical supports and evidence. The Mars is an interesting place for a planet.
