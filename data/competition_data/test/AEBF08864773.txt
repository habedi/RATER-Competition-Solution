Fellow citizens pollution is the big buzz these days, ecofriendly supplies are increasing, people want quite, cars are being created to be electrical, no polluting gases, solar power electricity! Ever since we were younger people drove attention to limiting car use in any possible way; like carpooling, riding the bus, riding bikes, or walking etc.. So what is this craze about limiting car usage?

In Vauban Germany, you can say there is no life in the fast lane, it is all life is peaceful. As a result 70 pecent of families in Vauban do not own cars; as Heidrun Walters says "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." As Walters walks Verdant streets there were swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor.

In Paris, there's not much peace or life in the fast lane, its city congestion!

After pollution measures reached a record high, Paris banned driving to clear the smog. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. On a Monday motorists with even-numbered liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. The smog eventually cleared enough to release the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

While in America after 2005 with the number of miles driven peaked, thereafter, that number steadily dropped. So does this mean America's love affair with its vehicles seem to be cooling? Probably not, but as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak, equal to where the country was in 1995. The explanation is greatly because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars. Now because America's recovery of recession and unemployment, we'll be noticing in the next few years ahead.

Therefore, limiting car usage can either be an accident, emergency, placeage, celibration, or choice. Either way limiting car use is great for our environment and great for your skin!
