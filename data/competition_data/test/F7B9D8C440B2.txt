Students across the country wake up and log on to their laptops to tune into the lessons prepared for the day. Now that there has been an explosion of technological use in the world with the role of techology increasing in our lives, many people are starting to consider integrating it with schools to make learning more accessible. While some may argue that it is beneficial to take classes from home because of the convenience, it is in fact more beneficial to go to school because it provides a much needed social space for students and offers powerful motivation

Schools offer a much needed social space for students today. It was easier than ever before to hole up in my room after school; I didn't have a single reason to leave. I had the whole internet at my disposal and I could spend hours browsing the web, playing videogames, or watching shows. Now that students are spending the majority of their time on phones, laptops, computers, and other devices; they are lacking the face to face communication that was so prevalent in earlier times. That last thing students need is more attachment to technology, whether it be educational or not. Schools help counteract this pandemic by forcing students to be together and provide a place for students to make long lasting and valuable friendships.

Schools also allow students to support and motivate each other .

There is a test encroaching upon our class and I am not confident in the subject at hand. After asking one of my classmates a question that I have been pondering, she swiftly answers it and tells me that she has been studying for atleast an hour for the past three days. Most are not born with the motivation to do well in school. Students that are around other motivated people, often become motivated themselves, spreading the successful habits throughout a myriad of people. Motivation is a huge factor in making successful people who they are and school is a vital place where motivation can be instilled.

Some people believe that it would be more beneficial for students if they attended online classes because it provides convenience that school lacks. While it does provide more convenience than commuting to school, this benefit is not outweighed by the cost because there can still be technological issues that delay learning. A student may not be able to connect to the internet in order to attend an online class or there could be a power outage that leaves the technology useless for learning.

School provides an area where not only can you find a great group of friends that you get to see in person, but also people that instill motivation within you, an integral part of any sucessful person. They have been and will continue to be an important institution for educating people around the world. With the rise in use of technology such as cell phones and computers, it is important to keep a balanced schedule between work and life in order to maintain a healthy mind and body.
