Dear, Principal

I have overheard that your policy to the school has been a problem. Stating that if students do not have higher than a B average, they will not be able participate in any kind of activities. What I feel is right is that the students should only participate in sports and or activities, is if they deserve it. Most student don't have to get higher than a B average, most students should be able to participate, many students should require at least a C-. That would be fair to the students through out the school. I've also noticed that students have been working hard to achieve this B average goal. Admitting I am affected by this policy, my grade average is B-. Most students are saying "this is not fair, we should participate if we want too." All I'm saying is that you could create a policy, but also make note that the policy should be fair to everyone.
