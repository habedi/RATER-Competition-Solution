Students say that summer assignments or projects made by teachers are hard. But, why do teachers give us such hard and lengthy summer projects? Teachers believe that summer assignments will help us retain our knowledge during summer vacation. Students think that it is a waste of time and takes majority of their summer vacation away, but it actually helps them get ready for there upcoming year. I believe that students should come out of their comfort zone and try something new or something that is helpful for their upcoming year. The summer assignments or projects should be designed by teachers because then they're more efficient, challenging, and help you learn.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they're more efficient. By being more efficient, students would be able to do well in their upcoming year. One of my friends was given a project by her teacher, her task was to teach the class, so she was basically the teacher. She had to make a slide of notes for one of the units that she was assigned and present it to the class. The presentation that she was making had to be efficient in order for her classmates to do well on their quiz or test. She was very hesitant and scared to present in front of the class. After she presented, the teacher explained to her how she did; she didn't get a perfect score, but still got a decent grade. My friend could do well on tests or quizzes, but when it comes to do a teachers job it's very difficult. This brings out the fact that teachers have the prior knowledge and the confidence to teach, make tests or quizzes, and summer assignments so they can be more efficient for students.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they're more challenging. Last year, my friend had a summer assignment, she didn't like it and was complaining to me about it. I told her that she should at least try it out and see how it is. She did try it; a couple days later she told me that the assignment was so much fun and was kind of hard but it was a challenge for her. My friend and I are the type of people who love a challenge. To me, summer assignments are seen as a puzzle piece, when given by a teacher. If any assignment is made by a student it's more confusing than easy.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because it will help you learn better. Last summer, I got a summer assignment; I looked at the paper and found it a little tricky to do, but I tried my best to finish it. When I started my school year, as a junior, I went to my classes for a whole week, and noticed that in the class where I had my summer assignment, was very easy. All the things that were being taught in class, I already knew because of the summer assignment. This states that the teacher did a good job of making the summer assignment and helping us learn better in class.

Some might say summer assignments or projects by students are better because they are easier to do; however, summer assignments by teachers are the best because they provide more knowledge for the students. Teachers have prior knowledge and know how to teach in a way where students find it best. Teachers want their students to compete with one another to learn and find new ways to understand the material. With a teachers assignment, it would help you learn better and prepare you for what's next.
