As new technology emerges, new forms education have been made. New technologies like phones and laptops are being incorporated into the school system. Because many students have access to a computer or mobile device, schools have made it an option for students to attend classes online or through the use of video conferencing, which would allow students to attend classes from home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to continue their education while sick and makes their schedules more flexible.

Sickness is one of the main reasons students are absent from school, but the option to attend class from home would allow these sick students to continue their education even while sick. In the fifth grade I missed 21 days of school due to an ongoing sickness. During that time I missed valuable class time and was set back in my education. In fear of having to go to summer school, I went back to school even though I was not yet fully better. Not only did It take a lot of hard work in order for me to catch up with my classmates, but I was also getting my classmates sick due to me being in school while partially sick. The option for attending school from home would have been very beneficial to me. If I attended school from home, I would have still been able to learn without getting far behind and it would have prevented illness from being spread to my classmates. Although in my case I was sick with a contagious illness, there are other noncontagious illnesses that can also hinder student education. Online schooling would not only be beneficial to students who are sick with a contagious illness, but it would also be beneficial to students who suffer from mental illnesses. Mental illnesses like anxiety and depression can greatly hinder a student's education. Often times students with these mental illnesses find it hard to get out of bed and go to school and consequently, they miss out on their education and fall behind the curve. Dealing with mental illness while trying to maintain on track with education can be very hard for students to juggle. With the ability to attend class from home, students with mental illness might feel more at ease knowing that they dont have to leave the comfort of their own home.

Along with being able to continue education while sick, the ability to attend school from home also helps students have a more flexible schedule. A struggle many students face is being able to balance a busy schedule. It can be hard to balance the time spent at school with the time for friends and family. School takes up a large portion of the day, leaving little flexibility in a students schedule. Just like many of my classmates, my day starts bright and early. For many students like me, it is essential to wake up early in the morning just to get to school on time. After being in school for seven straight hours, I go home to do my homework, which takes hours to complete. Once all is said and done, I have little to no time to spend with my friends and family or do many activities I enjoy doing. Although the school schedule is designed to help students get the most out of their education, it would be more beneficial if students attended school from home. Not all students work best when they are doing continuous work with minimal breaks. Having school online would benefit students by allowing them to create their own schedules. If assignments and videos of the lessen are posted online, students could access the material on their own time that is best for them. Attending school from home would make students' schedules more flexible, allowing them to have more time to enjoy their day and spend it how they wish.

While attending school from home has its benefits, there are some negative aspects to consider. Because attending school online requires that you have a mobile device and stable internet connection, students without access to these things would be at a disadvantage. If students don't have access to good WiFi or internet, it will become a challenge for them to access the course materials which are needed for learning, thus hindering their education that they would otherwise get if they attended the physical school. Although this is a valid concern, the ability to attend school from home is still beneficial. Even though students might experience some difficulty accessing the course material when WiFi is down, often times poor internet connection or WiFi can be easily fixed and it normally doesn't last for a long period of time. As technology continues to develop, more problems with technology (such as poor WiFi) will be solved. With this in mind, school from home is still beneficial to students.

Because technology is advancing, the school system needs to keep up with it and use these new technologies to their advantage. Incorporating technologies like phones, computers, laptops, and the internet into the school system can be very beneficial for the students. Allowing students to attend school from how through the use of the internet is a beneficial way for students to make the most out of their education. Providing students a new way to learn is a great thing that students could benefit from. Although it may have its downsides just like any other new way of teaching, it still benefits students by allowing them to continue their education while sick and create a more flexible schedule.
