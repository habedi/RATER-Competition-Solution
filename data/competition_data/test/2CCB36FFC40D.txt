I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, because it will get students active, you can socialize with your friends, and you can have fun!

Instead of staying at home all evening. Students can play sports, or stay after school to participate in educational, or non-educational activities, or clubs. You can join a Reading Olympics team, you can try out to play a sport, join an after school club, or maybe even create one. Instead of just staying at home all evening.

What if you didnt have the same classes with you friends? If you join an after school activity, you can have plenty of time to socialize with your friends. Maybe y'all could make your own club or activity that other students can join, so they can do the same with their friends.

Lastly, you can have a lotÂ of fun. Hanging out with your friends, joining an activity about something you love to do. I dont see anything wrong with any of that. And if you cant participate one night, thats fine.

So yes, all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, whether it would be after school, or on the weekend.
