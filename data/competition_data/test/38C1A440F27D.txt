As a scientist I had to discusss the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation of the face on Mars giving the mosts reasonable and lucid -something clearly shown- ideas. There is many reasons why this "face" was not made by aliens. As a scientist I had to explain some evidence that would show what this "face" is classified as. Also I had to show the main ideaology on these speculations or conspiracies that "know" what NASA is doing. My main job as scientist is to observe, study, and explain many mysteries but I had to use clearly expressed qualifications for the face to be created by aliens.

For my first reasoning on this topic I had to discuss this person how this landform is classified as mesa or butte which occurs normally in many environments. Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, "It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..." showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!

After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.

Another type of reasoning this "face" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this "face" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the "face," shows that the "face" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a "face" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.

Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.

So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the "face" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the "face" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.
