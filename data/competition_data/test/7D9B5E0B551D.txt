The Earth's sister planet, Venus, one of the planets in our solar system we know the least about. In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author made good points on how to overcome the difficulties presented by trying to learn more about Venus. Although many of the ways to get around the dangers of Venus didn't completely solve the problems. In my opinion the author didn't support his argument that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

The author contradicted many of his own points by stating facts that show that learning about Venus would be extremely difficult even with current technology. This is shown in paragraph six "peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere". Paragraph five spoke of a way scientist would study Venus from a hovering ship but then in paragraph six the author contradicted themself with the quote above.

The author made good points on reasons why Venus is worth studying despite the risks ,but in the end their counter claim outweighed their argument. Although Venus one of the best places to learn about how Earth formed, the risks outweighed the knowlege that would be gained.
