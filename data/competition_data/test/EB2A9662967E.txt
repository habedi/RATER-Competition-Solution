Dear Principal, 02/18/11

I believe that (Policy #1) will make all of us happy because Phones in school are useful for many reasons. Also if you chose (Policy #2) kids will try everything they can to have there phones in class. Policy #1 just seams like the right one because in my old school we had

Policy #1 like yours and it worked out really well kids had phones out when there teachers allowed them, they hade them out before and after school, and they hade them during lunch.

Phones are just one of the beast things kids could have in school they like to text and call each other and all those fun things you could do whit phones. If Policy #1 doesn't work out like it did in my other school then maybe you should see what parents think and maybe you could try what they say and if that doesn't work then Policy #2 will be useful. Phones are really helpful now in these days, I use my phone to get a hold of my parents. One of the questions you could have for me is that if its really important to get a hold of my parents then why not use the school phone? And my answer will be, "I could but there is nothing like using you're own when you talk in the schools phone everyone is listening to you're conversation and that is a little uncomfortable and if our parents are at work then texting is the think you could just sent them a message!"

I hope you could see my point of view i have about phones in school if you have any questions or problems just talk to me about it I would be more then glad to have a good talk.
