The author made it clear to us why they feel like we should persue Venus. The author had many facts to back up his idea that exploring Venus is worthy but can be dangerous. The author described many aspects of what could happen if we go to Venus. The author is very interested about Venus and gave a thorough explanation of why we should pursue Venus despite the dangers by giving supportive details of how it relates to planet Earth.

The author gives descriptive details on how Venus is just like earth and why we should go there in paragraph 4. The authors says that ¨The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters¨. This part of the text makes it to where Venus is a safe place to go because it ¨includes familiar features¨ as earth does. Which makes the reader believe that their is another planet like earth out their in the Solar system. Venus having ¨valleys, mountains, and craters¨ shows how closely related the planet Venus is to Earth. By the author putting this into the text give us a visual of what Venus really looks like if we touch down and started to build a civilization their.

The author gives the reader a realistic condition of Venus of why it is worth it but dangerous. In paragraph 5 towards the bottom the authors describes the conditions by saying ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth./ Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨. The author gives us a little scare of how it is dangerous because the temperature levels is ¨at around 170 degrees¨. That is very high and seems that no one would be able to survive there. The author also says ¨air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth¨ which is saying that the air level of 170 degrees is as close sea level so we could pontentially survive it. The author ends is by saying ¨Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨, which explains why he believes that it is dangerous but since it is survivable it is worth the try.

Furthore more, the author gave great explainitory details of what could come if we live on Venus, that of the good and the bad.

tryna build technology that is suitable for those conditions. The authors explains their idea with strong arguments and facts that make it understandable to theit idea.
