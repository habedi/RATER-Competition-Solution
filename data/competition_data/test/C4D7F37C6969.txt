School summer projects is the thing that students most dread in the summer, apart from summer school of course. Most of the time they are big, boring packets filled with long and boring questions. Usually everyone waits until last minute to complete them because thinking about them during vacation ruins the fun. But with student design projects everything would be different. School summer projects should be student designed instead of teacher designed. It would help the students get interested in the projects and topics they are about to learn, it would help the teachers better cater to their students in their lessons and it would also help the students explore their creativity and critical thinking in school related assignments.

A teacher's school summer projects is usually just a very thick packet with a lot of questions and a lot of work, they are no fun at all and students dread getting them. Most of the time this projects are not even projects, they're very thick packets with the words 'summer project' at the top in big bold letters.

With students being able to create their own student projects they can cater to themselves this allows them to design the project around something they did during their summer vacation or about an experience they had. These projects should be about using creativity to design something fun that involves what the students are learning and what they're experiencing in the real world. Most of the summer projects are assigned for their class courses for their upcoming school year. Having something that relates their summer vacations and their classes makes the students exited about their courses and all that they can do with it. It demonstrates to the students what they can do in real life with what they are learning at school. Since the students don't know what their summer project is they are going to be thinking about it their whole summer, when they do something they are going to be thinking about how it relates to that subject and if that can be their project. With students learning at different in different ways this allows them to demonstrate what their way of learning is and what they are most comfortable with. for example for visual learners it could be a poster with big picture and little to none words, for someone who doesnt not learn with drawings it could be a question and answer type project. Student led projects allow students to design their own project is the best way to capture their attention and make them exited about school.

Allowing students to create their own project would not only be beneficial to the students but also to the teachers. When looking at the projects it allows the teachers to get to know the students, as in every project there will be a part of the students in them. Even though teachers try to it's hard to relate to all of their students. Student designed projects allows the teachers to learn about what type of learners their students are, whether they are visual learners or something else it teaches them about how they can better reach their students and not loose their interest during the school year. This will also help the teachers when making their student plans, when they look at the project they will be able to see what part of the course the students are most exited about learning, what part they have already mastered and what part what part the student seem more confused about. With this information teachers can better creates their teaching plans and better cater to their students and their needs. When making teaching plans it is very important to mold it to the individual because not everyone learns the same way, and this project will help. Catering to each students learning pace and design helps them learn and be successful in their test and their future in those classes.

Permitting the students to deign their own projects also helps with creativity. In school everything is very structures, it help the students function better and have a more organized school, which is good. Having said this, having structure does not allow students to explore their creativity and their critical thinking all in one, with school related assignments. Creativity is a very important part of learning and if students are not allowed to express themselves once in a while they get bored and loose interest in the subject or in school all together. When students are allowed to design their own project they are able to explore their creativity in school assignments. Allowing them to design their own project allows them to express themselves in a way where critical thinking is essential to completing the task. Creativity and critical thinking are essential pieces to be successful in the real world and in professional settings.

When giving summer assignment teachers are expecting student to have fun and to keep learning during their summer vacation, but are students expected to have fun doing the assignments if teachers dont put anything fun in them. When assignments are not fun students loose interest and don't want to even think about completing the assignment. Students should be able to create their own assignment. Having student designed summer assignments would be beneficial to students and teachers. It would help o the students explore a new way of thinking about assignments, it would also help them explore their creativity and critical thinking all together, and it would also help teachers when planning their lessons to help find the best way for students to learn.
