Dear principal

I choose policy 1, because there is know reason to make us have to put our phone away when we aren't doing anything like lunch break, before school, while we are changing classes.

The best time for the cell phones are during lunch because most of the people don't eat the lunch food or they are shy and only talk to certain people.... Everyone has a cell phone, and all the teachers know when we are in the hall way we are going to pull them out. Most kids pull them out when the teachers are not look or don't think they are looking...

Some teachers don't like cell phones so bad that if the see it in the there pockets they try to take it.

When the principles take the phone they will try to make u wait until the parents get there but by that time the kids have convinces the parents that the teacher took it for know apparent reason. Then the parents get mad at the teachers. The principal starts getting all kinds of phones calls and complaints all because the teacher took the cell phone.

I know your thinking im just an 8th grader wanting to use my cell phone anytime i want to but its not like that al all. I fell its a very good reason why we should get to have our cell phone because everyone has one anyway and we cant always talk to our friends, they have other classes all the way down the hall way. If we not doing any school thing why not. i understand not having them in classrooms because they disturbed class if the ringer go off.

when your trying to text during class it makes them click clack and all that noisy it makes other students not get there work done... but outside of class what the big dell i don't understand that part of the agreement.
