Dear,principal i believe we should not allow the student to use phones in school because they they might forget to turn off their phones before they enter class,you are callying them and they don't hear you because they on the phones,my last reason is they might start failing school because they are thing about their phones more than work.

I think they should not use phones because what if they forget to turn off their phones and when you are talking the phone starts going off and u have to stop talking and wait till they turn their phone off or maybe the students are taking a big test and someones phone goes off

Another reasone why i believe students should not be allowed to use phones in school is because maybe you have to ask them something and they don't hear you because they are on the phone thalking to a friend about what to wear or something for a party.

my last reason for students not having phones in school is because how students have different lunch times one might text someone that is in class and than the otherone texts him back because they think the teacher is not looking at them,so if they text back that means he is not paying attion to the teacher but to the phone and that might turn into the students failing their classes.

those are the reasons why i believe students should not be allowed to use phones during school.
