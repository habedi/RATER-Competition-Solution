Have you ever had to do a project during the summer break? In some schools, they may require that you do a few projects in order to maintain what you have learned, usually being designed by the teachers, which may not work with most students. Instead, the students should design the projects as they know more what works for them educationally and they know how to adjust the project to their schedule.

Oftentimes, not all students learn content in the same ways; some students may be visual learners whereas others are more lecture based learners. This also extends to projects, where certain student excel better at certain categories, such as a music student being more effective at making music for a video project. Oftentimes in projects when a student can't effectively do a project, they get a lower grade, which lowers their average Grade Point Average alongside other things simply because they do not work well with the specific subject of the project. Because of this fact, students should design their projects as they know how they work as well as how the learn. Not only does a student designed project allow for the student to be more effective at completing it, it gives the students a greater interest in the topic, allowing both increased creative drive as well as increased motivation to complete the project.

When it comes to projects and deadlines, schools oftentimes roll out standards and assessments that don't take into account how the individual student would be able to effectively abide my them. In many cases there are students who are unable to complete assignments and attend events because of complications in their life that they can't control, such as, but not limited to: Needing to work to support their family, needing to care for a family member, having to travel to another country or place because of their family, and many more. In cases such as that, the projects and assignments set by the school, which are often based on the assumption that students do not possess any tasks beyond school, are simply hard if not impossible to complete for those students. If the students would be able to make their projects, then they can design them to fit alongside their life, making it so that they are more capable of accomplishing them. Alongside making it better for the students, it could help increase the high school graduation rate as many students drop out of high school because they are unable to complete their education.

In discussions of this topic, some may say that the students don't know what they need to do for the projects so they can't make them. This argument, however, is invalid for quite a few reasons. Firstly, the students know what the course that they took in the passing school year contained. As they know what the year contained, they can make their projects cover those topics. Secondly, the students don't need to design the project solely by themselves. The teachers of the respective course could be of assistance by providing a checklist of sorts to assist the students in making the project. Thirdly, the teachers who design projects often make them in a sweeping manner, which as been explained earlier doesn't work with all students.

In conclusion, summer projects that schools require should be made by students for a couple of reasons. These include the fact that students can adjust the project to fit their learning alongside that they can adjust it to better align with their life. For those reasons, schools should allow students to make their own summer projects.
