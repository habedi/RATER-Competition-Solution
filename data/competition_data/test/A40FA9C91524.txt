Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME. I attend you school SCHOOL_NAME.

I am writing this letter to aware you of the changes you have made in the school policy. I see that you have made a change that no students are allowed to play sports unless they have a average of a B , which I think is a great policy mentally. Because I think students have a high C they should still be able to participate in school actives because no kid wants to sit out.

I think that if students have a average of high C they should still be able to participate & also because students that have one C can be slacking off only in one class and I think that's acceptable. Not everyone does great in every class / subject. Also if students are really great at that sport we can be able to reward them with a scholarship. Like me I am a good student I have good grades the only class that I don't really great in is mathematics. I get a high which I think is acceptable.

This new policy I may think is also regarding many parents of the children in the School. Some parents probably may go along with this rule. Yes because it is a good rule I think this policy is good but should also be to student with a high C average . Why? Because if students have a high C they are closely high to B which in that matter are eligible to participate in the school major activities. I say "Major Activities" because I think it should only be sports that are eligible for scholarships like for boys/girls Basketball, Baseball, Soccer , Track , Football and Cheer leading.

Even if this a rule because the school board doesn't want to loose a lot of money which I would understand . But there is ways for a school to make money like having a fundraiser and also for the sports students can also go tagging like at the nearest food store . Ex. Shop rite,

Path mark, Stop n Shop etc. And get money for new outfits for the type of sport they are playing.

So TEACHER_NAME thank you for you time and I really hope that you put some mind into this and make a change. Thank you for your time . Lets go OTHER_NAME !

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
