Dear Principal,

I think that children should not be able to use a cell phone at all during school. If you allow them during free time then eventually they will try to run with their newly granted privileges and use them during class harming others learning environment.

Another problem is that school is supposed to be a place to learn not to socialize with your friends. The only thing a phone will do to kids at school is have negative affect on them.

Another reason that a no phone policy should be put in place is because phones do not help the students do anything but cheat and talk to their friends. Also if people are texting in between classes its not likely that they will stop their discussion just because their class started. In addition to that people may uses their phones to cheat on a test or get their homework answers from a friend. Again this is bad choice for the children of your school.

I hope you agree with me that their will be negative affects towards the students learning environment if you let them have new privileges that will let them cheat on tests, on their homework, and eventually in the long run themselves because they have bits and pieces missing out of their education that may eventually be helpful to them. Thank you for considering my opinion.

Your student,
