Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to support mine, and others' choices to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them whenever free time is available. Such as lunch time, you don't have to work on anything, or pay attention, it's your own free time. I think it is the perfect opportunity to use your cell phone.

Another great opportunity to use your phone would be between class periods. Let's say, that your mother is coming to pick you up early from school, but doesn't know where the front office is or where to sign you out. That is when you would call or text your mother and tell her where the front office is and where to sign you out.

Finally, a great opportunity to use your cell phone would be when you have advisory. Every single day in advisory, all we do is read or do worksheets, but what about when we are done with those books or worksheets. That would be the perfect time to use your cell phone. If you have an emergency, if you feel sick, if you have a broken bone, anything. Even though the nurse is there, sometimes she doesn't let you go home. Therefore, as a backup plan you could use your cell phone to contact your parent or guardian. I hope you take into consideration, my choice to allow students to use their cell phones during time that is available. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
