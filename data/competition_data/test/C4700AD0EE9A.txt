Mr. principle

I think its a great idea for students to help out and join community service, you should require all students to join. Helping the community is very important because there aren't a lot of people who would take the time to help out.

They probably think its a waist of time when its not. Not many people want to stop what there doing or some are just to busy. The community is a lot in need for some support and help, and we should give it to them if they need it.

There are a bungle of things that students can help with, little elementary kids with hard school assignments that parents come home too late to help with.

dirty ponds and lakes that need cleaning up, parks with loads of trash everywhere, buildings with nasty spray paint all over and senior citizens who need help around the house. Also on Halloween there's little kids who need to get around the area without trouble, and not all little kids have older brothers and sisters to take them.

There are animal shelters and so much more they can do for the community.

I have friends in the ninth grade who perform service to the community and it helps them with there high-school diploma. Some just do it because they think its right and a good thing. So that's why Mr. principle all of us and students should come together and do what we can for the community.
