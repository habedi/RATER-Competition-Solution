Dear principal,

Although many of the students have an average grade of a c you shouldn't consider changing school policy. About the whole thing that is requiring you to have at least a b average to be allowed to participate in sports or other activities.

You should not allow this idea to happen. one because many of this students don't have any other time to get fit in sports or be part of an activity. two because this students may be trying their best at school and we might not get them. in my opinion ,this policy should not be a part of our school. We should give students the opportunity to get fit in sports their bin to.

Although you may thing I'm not the same as those students I know i' am and

I also know that when this students are into a sport they don't quit they play and play until they have reached their goals. That's a great way for us the students to learn that life is not about quitting but about tiring to reach your goals.

As you see this letter was to persuade you to not make that idea going trough your head right now, but to give students an opportunity to try and reach their goals as students of this sports/ activities. Thank you for unde
