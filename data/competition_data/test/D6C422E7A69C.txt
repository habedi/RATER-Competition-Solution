Cars are a very annoying part of life implanted in american history. They dont know when to shut up sometimes, just so noisy and loud. They fill the fresh clean air with nasty smog. And i dont know about you but i sure dont want to be caught in a traffic jam for half the day.

First off, they're so noisy and loud sometimes you just want to yell atthem like a 3 year old baby crying. Speaking of babies crying a loud car driving by your house on a calm day when your baby is sleeping could wake him/her up and nobody wants that. And when people are trying to get some rest at night a noisy car speeds by their window and wakes them up. Also what if you want some relaxation time maybe take a bike ride in your neighborhood or enjoy a cup of coffee. That would get ruined by the sound a car driving by.

Ive found my self outside in the city gasping for air and have wondered why that is. Well if youd turn your attention to the big hunk of metal parked in your drive-way thats the reason. Cars are one of the worst sources for pollution in todays society. Cars run on fossil fuel which when burned is turned into a pollutant and makes the air unbreathable. After days of almost breaking the record of pollution Paris partially banned driving to clear the air of all the smog. This smog can even be blinding from time to time if it gets to the point where the pollution gets too serious.

Finally, who wants to be stuck in a traffic jam all day. Not me i know that for sure. People have places to go and when there is a traffic jam because peoplewant to take a look at the car accident it gets pretty frustrating. Also traffic stress's some people out to the point where they do something illegal to get out of traffic. Traffic jams can also be very dangerous people can get in serious car crashes and be severely hurt or even worse killed.

Cars can be a nuesence in plenty of ways. More ways than i can think of these are only just three reasons asto why cars are bad. They're noisy, dirty and even very dangerous if your not careful. Getting into a car is like turning on a slot machine you dont know what will happen you might make it there and you might not and thats why they need to exit todays society, itd be better off that way.
