Dear Principal,

I think changing the school policy so that students have to have a grade B average is not really necessary because some kids that have a grade C average could be like one point or two points away from having a B average and they could be one of the better players on the team. Even the whole team or most of them could have a C average so if they couldn't play the team would have to forfeit the game and that could be the game to go to the state play-offs. Some of the kids parents and even the rest of the school not playing sports mite not like that the team had to forfeit the game to go to the state play-offs. So if the principal decides to change the school policy so that the students have to have a B average then he is going to have a lot of angry parents and a lot of angry students blaming him that they couldn't go to the state championship when they would have a chance to win the trophy and even possibly get medals for winning the state play-offs. They would miss getting a picture of them winning it and they could put it in there trophy case beside the trophy.
