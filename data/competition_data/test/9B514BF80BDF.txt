Have you ever had to do a required summer-reading project? Most schools require students to read a book and write a paper or present a project on it. These projects take a lot of time from our summer break. But what if I told you that you can choose your own project topics and ideas? Students should be able to design their own projects so that they can choose a topic that they are actually interested in, get creative with their own ideas, and have fun while doing it.

To start things off, these projects would be better if they were student-designed because the students would choose topics that they are actually interested in. Nobody wants to spend their summer break reading and writing a report. If the students got the chance to write or present about something that they are interested in, then everyone would have fun and the chances of everyone doing the project on time are higher. There are so many different things that they could talk about, for example, an activity they did that summer, stories about the places they have traveled to, a sport they played or are getting ready to play. The possiblities are endless and the students will want to do the project. You will not have to worry about anyone cheating or presenting the same thing over and over again. 9 times out of 10, a student will forget to do their project until last minute and text their classmates, "Hey which book did you read? Did you write the paper? Can I see it?" They will not do the project on their own and it will not benefit them in the slightest. Not only would they be more interested in it, but they will also be more creative because it will be about something they care about. It will benefit everyone more if the projects were student-designed.

Speaking of getting creative with their projects, students are more likely to create something different if it is about a topic they care about. If all students are forced to read the same book, they will all write about the same thing and could potentially cheat. Now if the students were to choose what they were going to write about on their own, they will allow more ideas to flow. Back on the students choosing topics such as what they did over the summer and sports they play, you will see different projects and read different papers because not everyone does the same things. You could read about a trip to an island or going hiking on a rocky trail or going to an amusement park. It is very unlikely that students did the exact same thing. Students have a very vivid imagination and can be creative all the time. But if you tell a student to sit down for an hour, read a book, and then write a paper, nothing will happen. "You have to let the juices of the young mind flow and let the ideas come together," quote from Generic_Name, a teacher's assistant. She believes that forcing students to exactly what you want will leave you disappointed. You will see true progression and growth in letting them do their own thing.

Some may say that if students are not told exactly what to do, then they will be lost or confused. These same people also say that without someone constantly reminding them of what to do, that they will soon forget and fail. It is understandable for adults and our teachers to believe that students do not care about school or push every assignment to last minute as if we did not remember to do it or just did not want to. Despite these reasons, students will choose to do the work if it is fun and benefical to them. If they were allowed to choose and design their own projects, they would be receiving a grade for having fun and discussing something that they enjoy. All school year long, we sit in classrooms and are forced to learn things that we do not care about and that will not help us with adult life. We do not want to spend our summer doing that exact same thing. Personally, as a student, designing our own projects about something we are delighted by would be an amazing opportunity. There will be no excuse on why a student did not do it or did not have it finished because it is a whole porject based on you and your interests. Undoubtedly, we should design our own projects and create our own ideas.

In conclusion, students should be able to design their own projects so that they can choose a topic that they are actually interested in, get creative with their own ideas, and have fun while doing it. Students need to be able to use their imagination in school. If you got to design your own project, what would your topic be?
