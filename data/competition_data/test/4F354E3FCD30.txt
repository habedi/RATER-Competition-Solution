Dear Principal,

I would like to address the situation of you considering that only B average students may join sports. Most students do not currently have that grade and it would be a challenge for them. It would encourage students to keep their grade point up if you did this. You should change the school policy so that students need to maintain at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities.

If you changed the policy students would try harder and I am sure most of them could easily reach a B average. Getting a B average is not that difficult but it makes you look so much better. By making this policy many students will change their work habits. The school will look better and students will be motivated to receive a higher grade average which would also make their parents happier. I guarantee that if this school policy was changed the majority of students would get better grades within a short period of time.

Students need to learn how to earn good grades or some day they will not make it to a good college. Most children don't realize that it's very important to have at least a B average. When one doesn't try hard in school their entire life will be effected. As a principal, I am sure you hope your students will succeed in life. They need to get good grades and it is very good that you are really trying to get them to earn those grades.

Many of your students will work harder in school if you change the school policy so that students need to maintain at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities, so you should do that. That would really raise the grades of students at your school. It would be a good decision to change the school policy for that reason.
