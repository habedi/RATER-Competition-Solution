THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

The Electoral College is somewhere they vote for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. A majority of 270 electors votes is also required to elect the President. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution is the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and they treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ''Certicate of Ascertainment'' listing all the candidates who had ran for President in your state along with the names their respective electors.

The thing thats wrong with the electoral college is that the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century to the system that allows for much worse. Because each state casts only one vote to the single representatives from California to who the represent 35 million voters. The best arguments in favor mostly assertions without much basisÂ  in the reality. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee is possible that the winner of the electoral vote not win the national popular votes..
