When Don came to me and asked me to go to Europe I was glad that is said yes because it's a great adventure that you will never forget. We joined the seagoing cowboys for a reason, it was so we could help out in Europe. When I got to Europe so many diffrent type of countries were riped apart. It was like if there was a huge explosion in a city and it was all gone. People that lived there seem like if they really needed help. We need to help them recover their food suplies, animals, and more.

The day the Pacific war ended we headed for Geece with 388 horeses and hay to feed them all.

When I turned 18 I could have been drafted to military severice but they told me to just keep doing what I was doing. I loved the seagoing cowboys and the trips that we made.

In total I made 16 trips. I think that being a seagoing cowboy is amazing. If you get bord we play talble-tennis,fencing, reading, and writing. I also believe that every one else should try it out and experiance being a seagoing cowboy.
