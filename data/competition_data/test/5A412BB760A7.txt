Dear principal i think you should allow us students to use our cellular devices during school as long as it's during lunch and free periods. Other wise we wouldn't have anything to do during that time. And i believe that i am not the only one who feels this way. Which i am sure you realize. My reasons for my opinion are some of these, we might have an emergency and need to call a parent to come pick us up. During our free time some of our other friends might be in different classes and we might want to talk to them which we could do by cell phones. Our parents might text us because of an emergency. You never know what could or might happen. We also could have unfinished business that we might need to take care of. And cell phones also can be helpful to text a teacher that teaches another class because you might have left something in their classroom or forgot about what you had to finish for homework. You know cell phones can be helpful in many ways that you might not fully see or understand that us teenagers do. Those are my reason why i think we should be allowed to have cell phones during lunch and free time at school. Thanks for your time and understanding , I really appreciate you reading over this letter that i have wrote to you.
