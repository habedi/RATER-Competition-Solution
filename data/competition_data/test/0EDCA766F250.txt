The Face of Mars. What a discovery! This geological wonder on Mars has been very famous since its discovery in 1976. Its been seen in films, magazines, books, even at grocery stores. It's so popular that some people wonder how it came to be. One popular theory is that the Face was made by aliens, or martians if you will. I believe that theory is absurd. There are so many reasons to show that this was not made by some form of a living being.

First off, if this was made by an organism, then where r they? Why did they leave? What was their reason for making this face? Why isn't it more detailed if the beings that made this were intentionally making a face? It just doesn't add up. Besides, even if it was made by someone, wouldn't we have found some residue of civilization? When ever someone, or something, leaves a place there is always a geological hint that they were there.

That's why I believe that it was naturally made. It's not that hard to believe, actually. There are some of those naturally made landmarks here on Earth as well. For example, there was a winter in Colorado where a mountain had snow on it's side in the form of a "Y". There is also Eagle Lake in Michigan. Why is it called Eagle Lake? Because it looks like an eagle from above. So I have no doubt that this "Face on Mars" is naturually made. It was not made some alien civilization.
