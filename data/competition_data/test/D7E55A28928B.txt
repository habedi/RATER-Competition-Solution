Dear State Senitor,

Imagine how it would be if citizens votes counted in electing the next president. Do you believe in freedom of speech and petition? You shall let qualified citizens vote than letting the Electoral Collage vote for the president of the United States. Citizens should be able to vote because they are the ones who will have that future president running their country. It is stated, that under the electoral college system, voters do not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who elect the president. Electoral Collage method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by themselves. The voters are most likely to feel disenfranchised knowing that their votes do not count. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
