To the Principal,

Students in school love to play and not stay in class all day. They do this by attending extra sports and activities. You have been planning, as the principal, to create a new law in our school stating we need an at least B average to participate in our sports or activities. I myself actually do agree on this new rule with you. This new rule in my perspective could impact our average student grade.

Students just love to play sports and attend activities. If they are getting a low grade in academics however, they should not be doing extra classes. If you create a grade limit, people will focus on their grades much more. This is because when a pupil wants to attend extra classes, they will be forced to work harder. Therefore, students will have a higher grade average and probably will maintain it to stay in their activities.

The extra classes will very much be like a reward for hard work. If a student is lagging behind in grades, they don't deserve a reward, not until they do better in school. The people who are above and beyond, over achieving, and ahead of everyone really do deserve an award. If they put so much effort into school, they really are eligible for extra classes. This is how you get students focused in school.

Students love to play and have fun but there is a limit to that. Your potentially new rule can put on and enforce that limit to get students worried about their grades. The average student academic grade could potentially soar higher as students will want to join extra-curricular activities. Students need to be put on a restriction or else grades may get worse as time elapses. I recommend to you, the principal, that you enforce and put this rule into action as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Your Student
