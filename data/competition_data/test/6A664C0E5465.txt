Some people might think that the Face photograph taken from 1976 is an alien artifact, an alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However the Face is in fact a natural landform or a Martian Mesa. A Martian mesa is common around Cydonia or the Red Planet.

The evidence that the Face is a natural landform is because the Face was found around Red Planet or the Cydonia that commonly have Martian mesa . Even though the Martian mesa looks like a face, it is actually a giant rock formation "which resembles a human head...formed by shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." Also, when the Face was taken again on April 5,1998, by Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team with a ten times sharper camara compared to the origional Viking photos, it reveals that the Face was "no alien monument after all." Still, some doubt the picture of the Face because it was not in the right weather or angle. However, when Mars Global Surveyor took the picture of the face again at the right angle and weather, it revealed that the face was actually a Martian which is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

Some people might still think that the Face is an alien artifact, alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However, the Mars Global Surveyor showed and provide evidence that the Face was a natural landform or a Martian Mesa that is common around the Red Planet. To sum it all up, the Face is a natural landform according to the evidence that the Mars Global Surveyor provided.
