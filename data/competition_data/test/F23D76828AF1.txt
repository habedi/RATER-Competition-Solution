Some schools are trying to offer distance learning as an option for students, that means that students have the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students find it less stressful, students get their work done on time and students have more time to do extracurricular activities outside or inside of school.

The majority of students find it less stressful to attend classes from home, for example: Around the schools people talk about how great would it be to take classes online instead of going to school because they have a job and attending classes online is the best choice for them since the majority of students don't have time to go to school because of their jobs, another example is that students overthink about the classes that are taking in school, which classes are going next and that stresses them out, but if they take classes online they would not stress too much about since online is easy for students. The last example is that the majority of students have anxiety for seeing a lot of people, that stresses them out too, when they go to school there is a lot of students, they are loud and push each other, the schools are overpopulated, and that gives students anxiety and it is much better to take classes online then go to school.

Students get their work done on time if they choose to attend classes online. For example: At my school, Generic_School, students try to do their work but other students instead of working they don't because they are playing around with their friends, sleep in class and even worse, they horseplay in class and that distracts the people that are doing their work or trying to finish it during or in class and that is disturbing for them so that makes them want to attend classes online from home and get their work done on time then going to school and distract themselves and not get their work done on time and get bad grades becuase of the distraction they have in school.

Students have more time for activities if they attend classes from home by way of online. For example: My friends do sports and clubs, but school makes them have less time for them to attend because of the amount of work that the school gives, but they heard that in online it is not like that because they can work easely in the computer instead of writing in a piece of paper like schools do all the time and that makes them have more time to do extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, taking classes online from home is the best choice for students. If they prefer this option, it would benefit them because they find it less stressful, they get their work done on time and they have more time to do extracurricular activities outside or inside school. Students should choose this option because it brings them many positive reasons and with this option they can achieve their goal and have fun at the same time, this choice is not going to waste their time at all.
