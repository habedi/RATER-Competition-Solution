Dear Principal

I know that we should at least have a B average when were playing sports but i think students still could at least have a c average.

The reason i think this is because sometimes it's hard to do sports and get a good grade.

Sometimes it not always be about the sports being involved it can be issues involving outside of the school for example family issues.

Maybe it could be even though were playing sports it could be that we try our best but we still don't get it but it's just too hard for people to understand.

But I still don't think that it's fair to take away sports because actually sports is good for us.

It gives us a boost to work harder because we just can't wait to go and do that sport.

Also I don't think that it is fair that the student's with a

B average get to play and we don't.

Another reason i think it's not fair is because then it would make students angry and they would probably start a petition or something close to that and start not doing their work and that would be bad for their education.

Another one of my reasons is what if one of the other outside activities involved helping charity and we had a C then in that situation would we still not be allowed to do that or in that kind of situation could we be allowed to do that outside activity with a C average and that was one question that i' m sure will get people thinking about and maybe want to consider not to change the grading average we would have to have in order to participate in sports.

Instead of changing the grading policy that we have to have for sports why couldn't we just change another rule for something else. Also and my last statement for letting us play sports even though we don't have a B average is because it helps the school and it helps the school by every time we hold an event and games we are help raising money for the school so we can by more technology an supplies to make the school better.

Them are all my reasons why I think she shouldn't change the rules on everyone should have a B average instead of just having a C or better.

I hope that you read my letter and think about all my reasons for keeping the grading policy for sports the way their suppose to be thank you for reading this and hope that ensure mine and everyone's wishes for keeping the grading policy for sports.

Sincerely:
