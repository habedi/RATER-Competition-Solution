How do you now there is an intellegent life form making these so-called supernatural phenomona? The fact's show that this is just a natural landform. I know the other side to this. You might be thinking to yourself"Why does it look like a face in the 1976 picture,Then suddenly goes back to a "natural"landform."The answer to your question would be that the image was unclear and really blurd in 1976,and as technology evolves the image gets sharper and cleaner. Thats when people start to think "How did this face on a planet we know little to nothing about desapear of the span of 25 years."Thats where conspiracy therios come in,and then we get protesters and signs say"NASA is lying"then we get no funding because of the conspiracy. the point here is that this is a perfectly scientific,logical phenomena that we can explain with a simple theroy. Erosion of time is one of the reasons there are so many land slides or avalanches. The mars "face" may have been a face at one point because it is a landform. Erosion is a simple little matter of eroding and object over time with the natural elimates and/or manmade objects. That is why The face on mars is not a face but Just mesa or a butte.
