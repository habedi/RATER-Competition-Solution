In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" , the image or "face" on mars you seen was not made by aliens. In passage 7 it said " And so April 5th, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mar Orbiter Camera {MOC} team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, recealing .... a natural lamdform. There was no alien monument after all." So there is proof that it can't be an alien marking.

In paragraph 12 , it says ,"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West. "it reminds me most of Middle Btte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same heights as Face on Mars'."

So with these supporting details i conclude this argument by saying the "Face on Mars" was not an alien marking.
