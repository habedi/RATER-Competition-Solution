Dear Principal,

I have a negative feeling towards the new sports policy, If a student has grade lower than a B average they cannot compete in sports. The policy can do more harm than good. I think this an unjust policy.

Many students already have a C average on there report cards. If this policy were to come into effect the sports teams would be very small then our school will be wasting our budget on small teams. Another reason the school sports policy shouldn't be changed is, a C is a passing grade and students should not be punished for getting a passing grade! A third reason that the policy should stay the same is, students need exercise! With many students being unable to participate in school sports it makes them unable to exercise which leads to obesity. And an obese nation. A final reason the sports policy shouldn't come into effect is sports teach individuals teamwork and responsibility. Two necessary skills need in adulthood.

A possible compromise between you and the students of this middle school is to change the policy to If a student a has a final grade on there report card of a D or lower they then cannot participate in sports. Another Solution to this problem is, If a student has a more than four or five C averages on there final report card then they cant participate A final idea for the school sports policy is to suspend the student of sports for a couple of weeks. If they have a failing grade.

The new sports policy If a student has grade lower than a B average they cannot compete in sports. It can do more harm than good. I think this an unjust policy Exsersize, responsibility and teamwork are some of the key factors needed in life that would be token away with the new school policy.
