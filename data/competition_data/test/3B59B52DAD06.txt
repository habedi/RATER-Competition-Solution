The Facial Action Coding System I believe to be a great idea. The Facial Action Coding System begins when the computer construcrs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Using something like this could be good or bad, because maybe not all students or parents feel comfortable with teachers being able to read their childs emotions. Being able to read some students emotions may help with potential problems with the child to see how they are really feeling. One main reason I am for this invention is in paragraph 6 in the artical it says " A classsroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", Dr. Huang predicts "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The Facial Acting Coding System might actually be more accurate than you think, because the creaters have thought ahead, maybe you're feeling a certain way but the computer say differently, or your exspressions for some emotions could be slightly different than oothers. Paragraph 4 in the artical " even though individuals often shoe varying degrees of expression" ( like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. In conclusion your home PC can't handle something as complex as decoding Mona Lisa's smile. But it can write down simple instructions that "encode" differnt emotions.
