Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Some people don't understand why it isn't okay to litter. I think i would be a great idea to litter. I think this because students can learn not to litter and help out are environment too. this is good for everybody it shows we have the entiative to help out making earth a cleaner safer place for everyone. But community serves id not just for cleaning up the earth its for also helping people who need us. For example like an elderly home or reading to the blind. There's just so many ways we can help people we just need a little push.

Kids are age don't care if they litter or not but i bet they would if they new how it affected are environment. Litter can hurt living things because they think its okay for them to use but its not some animals try to eat that stuff or build a nest out of it. This could be dangerous for them. Also most of the trash ends up it streams, lakes, or ponds. Soon there's no water left for the animals or the plants and they so start to die.

When we help someone out it might make us feel better and more alert of out surroundings. And plus your making someone's day. When we help out other people it shows that we have good leadership skills. When you take time out of your day to help someone or something your making an effort to help make somebody a little bit stronger.

Our school should promote community serves to promote that we actually care. And to show that if we can to do it you can do it too.
