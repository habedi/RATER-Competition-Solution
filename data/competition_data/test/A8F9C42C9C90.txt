the author supports his idea well because there could be fossiles we never even knew exsited on venus and they say that venus is the closest twin to earth so its worth a shot right? honestly we should because what if they discover that venus was like earth and it just changed and killed everything else off and all the oceans and seas evaporated and thats why theres such a thick cloud above it. i honestly think that they should try because what if venus was like earth and there were other types of life forms on there that werent human it could be ground breaking and what if earth is headed to turning out to be like venus. and if we do find fossils and other things to indicate that there was life on venus and it just all died off because of the heat. we could learn how to prevent it happening to earth with future generations.
