I DO NOT think students would benefit from distance learning.

Distance learning isnt for everyone , My personal opinion is that i wouldn't have or want distance learning because I am more of a person that loves to interact with people and having a personal 1 on 1 with my teachers for help. There's a lot of pros and cons to learning at home , a con is that you wont have friends to talk to and socialize , a pro you don't have to rush to get up in the morning to get on the bus or get to class early after every period . Do you think learning at home is for you, lets find out.

The most problem I've heard from home teaching is that there's no socialization and no help. I had a friend that use to get home schooled, me and him talked about it. He said it was hard there wasn't anyone around to show him how to do the work, NO teachers, NO students he was struggling while taking some lessons and he had almost no friends to socialize with he was home all the time. Also, Video conferencing doesn't show students that they can learn from it, although It feels like you next to the teacher but people tempt to doze off or fall as sleep or not even do their work , I would love to have a teacher next to me showing me how i can do math or help use write an essay. But there are, also; some people that like getting home schooled, have getting been home schooled since they were a little boy or girl, the pros about distance learning is that you can sleep in, not worry about having to wake up at 5:30 in the morning or worrying about getting to class late . There's students that are use to it and can do individual work on their own. Having individual working skills is hard, having to not need help, everyone needs help in their at least once. Everyone hits a milestone in their life where they fall and need help to get back up. But being able to stay home feels great starting a lesson when every you have time, waking up at any time, as much as that sounds nice and fun I wouldnt want distance learning, Because going to school and being able to talk to friends and teacher is nice and easier than taking an online class.

Getting home school or taking an online class isn't easy. I wouldn't like to talk to a person on a computer or showing my work through a camera and not being able to correct it right after or show your teacher so they can correct it. It's the best staying home and taking classes online because to time limit to get up in the morning and you don't have to worry about needing to get to class early , I still haven't whether it's best to stay home or not. Having friend and teachers that can help is nice and fun and you can socialize a lot . Also staying home to do your work and relax sounds nice but it's still not the best. I rather come to school and socialize rather than staying home. Now, ask your self would you rather be at least or be home schooled/ Distance learning?
