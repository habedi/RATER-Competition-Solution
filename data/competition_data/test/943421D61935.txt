Dear Principal,

I believe that the idea of allowing Students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods, and free times as long as the phones are off during class time is a great idea. Many Students Today get in trouble for using their phone so by making it an option to use outside of class time may limit the amount of students getting into trouble. Common consequences for cell phone usage In modern day schools, are Warnings, confiscation of the device, and lastly confiscation and a parent or legal guardian must get it back for you.

By using this new cell phone policy, Parents and students could be relieved from stress.

There will always be those students who are going to text anyways no matter what during Lunch/Recess. Therefore Policy #2 wouldn't be such a great idea. Students who get their phone taken in school by an administrator or teacher, may react in anger or aggression, leading to a bigger problem like talking back to a teacher, or starting a fight out of anger. which would of course have bigger consequences, In Conclusion Policy #1 is better because it has a good effect on both students and teachers.

I hope you look into my thoughts and opinions, For the benefit of our school.

Thank You. Sincerely,
