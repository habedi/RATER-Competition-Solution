Phones and Driving

People can't continue to allow phones while driving. More laws should be enforced about having phones in your possession while operating a motor vehicle. It is very dangerous and can lead to fatal situations. However, others think it's not necessary to have laws that take away time on the phone while driving.

Throughout the last couple years, having phones while driving have been a big factor in car accidents. There have been laws that have been put out to try and keep people from using them while driving but people do not like to listen. This causes car crashes and human death.

Car crashes are the main causes of teen death alone. Most of them are from using phones while driving. Over 1.6 million crashes happen each year due to phone use. Nearly 390,000 injuries.

So from now on we have to limit or even take away because people's lives are at risk with these phones. Teens deaths are going to continue to rise. Death tolls will spike if we let this happen. Laws will have to enforce it more aggressively.
