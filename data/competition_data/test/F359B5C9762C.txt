Some schools require students to complete projects during summer break. Teachers do this so that students don't become lazy when they return to school and it keeps their brains working. Doing projects during summer break will ensure that all students keep using their brains and don't just "turn them off." Projects should be teacher-designed because the projects won't be off topic, and the criteria will be correct; even though, students will be more interested in the work if they could create it.

First, the project won't be off topic if it's created by a teacher. The teachers know what students need to be taught before graduation and can make sure the project benefits the students. Doing this, students may get to graduate sooner if the projects cover what could be taught in a classroom. With the teachers creating the projects, they can ensure that the students are learning what needs to be learned and there are no mistakes.

Secondly, all the criteria in the project will be correct. Teachers are more experienced in creating work for the students; therefore, the projects will be challenging enough to keep students brains working and it will all be correct. Students would have a hard time trying to come up with a project and having to create it all at the same time. It would be less challenging for the kids and less stressful for the teachers.

However, with students making the projects this will ensure that the students will be more interested in the topics. Students will be more inclined to do the work if it's something they like and can choose. People would complete more work doing something they like. With that, teachers may see a rise in grades if students can complete something that is in their best interest.

Lastly, projects should be teacher-designed because the projects won't be off topic, and the criteria will be correct; even though, students will be more interested in work if they could create it. If students have to do work during summer break, then they have to make sure that it is beneficial. Teachers should create them so that all the projects help each individual. Projects are insured that they're beneficial and helpful if a higher authority creates them.Â
