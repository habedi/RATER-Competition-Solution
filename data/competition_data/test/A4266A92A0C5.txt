Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing this letter today to tell you that I completely agree with what you plan to do. It would greatly help society if there was a B average policy on sports. Here are just a few reasons why i believe you should increase the grade average for sports: help teams with teaching sports, increase students intelligence, and build a smarter society.

The first and one of the most important reasons why the grade average should be raised is so the coaches for the sports team can better explain how to play the sport safely and properly to the players. With a higher average students that sign up will be smarter if they have to maintain a B average rather than a C average. Also, it can help Coaches better explain the way to play the sport and how to do things more properly and how to do it a safely as they possibly can . Lastly, it can give each team a more fair chance to win a game.

Next, with a higher average students would have to do better in school. With the average raised students would have to strive to do their absolute best in class in order to play the sport that they desired to play. It will help the students become much smarter in school because they will more than likely have to study more for tests and pay more attention in school. Lastly, it will give students less time to goof off or mess around in school or at home due to the average being raised.

Finally, quite possibly the most important reason for raising the grade average to a B is to build a more sophisticated society. I myself play sports and notice how many people actually play them and if the grade average was raise then I know that all the people I see playing sports are smarter than they were before because they had to do better in school. It would also make the kid/teenager population increase in terms of being more sophisticated. Lastly, if the grade average was raised then it would increase students smartness, but as well as showing that your school is a higher educated school and more than likely will appeal to families and they would want their child to attend at your school because they want the highest education possible.

Increasing the grade average to a B would by far make the community much smarter. Many kids at a Junior High level play sports and with the average being raised they will all be more intelligent than in previous years. Helping Coaches, Increasing students sophistication, and creating a smarter society are just a few of the many reasons why increasing the grade average is a tremendous policy.

Sincerely,
