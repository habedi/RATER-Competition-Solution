Hello there! I'm Luke. What do you want to be when you grow up? A farmer? A surgeon? How about a Seagoing Cowboy? No, it's not a job where you ride seahorses with a Cowboy hat (Although that would be awesome). Being a Seagoing Cowboy meant a lot to me, and if you are a young boy in hopes of helping those in need in this war, it is the job for you! So here are reasons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

First of all, Seagoing Cowboys help countries ruined by WWII by taking care of horses, young cattle, and mules taken overseas to them by us. In a way, you not only help that broken country, but you are helping the U.S. When you help us help another country, they will most likely help us back, forming alliance for war purposes. So you not only help them, but us as well!

Last year in 1947, as a young boy, went on many great adventures to amazing places. Along with helping people, I also went to places like an ancient Greek acropolis, Venice, Italy to ride a gondola, and ancient China, where I excavated a ruined castle. Along with helping those in need, I also got to admire the great Parthenon, or see the Panama Canal. These places are only a small handful you get to go to as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Along with the sights, you get to travel the open ocean. If you are an ocean person, you probably want to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Traveling the sea is an amazing experience, as seing unexplored islands, the galaxy at night, and sparkling blue water is quite a life-changer. Rarely did I ever see a storm out on the Atlantic, so no worries there.

Overall, being a Seagoing Cowboy is the job of a lifetime. I remember doing all these things, and I still do them today! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a way to forget about WWII, and see the world as a peaceful place again. With the right training, this job can help you see the beauty in this fine world. So if you want to forget about war, and help those in need, see extraordinary sights, and travel the sea, then join us! I'll sea you on the high seas!
