School sports have always been very important, to both the students and the school. They have been played for decades and are very entertaining to watch. It helps show pride in your school, but is that really what the purpose of school is about? Most students would argue against this policy but I think that it is the right thing to do.

There are many reasons why students with below a B average should not participate in school sports. First, if they have below a B average that means that they are struggling so instead of playing sports they should be studying and by playing school sports that enables them to do that. Also the purpose of school is to learn. Kids can play sports outside of school but school should not be about sports. And lastly many kids play school sports because they believe that they will prosper to become something better. But realistically the chances of going pro or even playing in college sports are very slim. Almost everyone will make their living off of what they learned in school and many students need to understand that.

Overall students should not participate in school sports with under a B average. Many people may argue that they have the right to do whatever they want and I condemn that. But not when it comes to school. School is a place to learn and students with under a B average should be out trying to raise that grade. I hope by reading this that you will realize that this is the right thing to do, no matter how many critics there may be.
