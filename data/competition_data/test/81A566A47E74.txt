In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" it show that the author likes to study Venus because it is like earths "twin". the earth can be dangerous but worth learning about. the earth can be livaible for humans with harsh conditons. not knowing what we can have without trying cannot be the right choice.

Venus is called earth's twin becaue as in the text it states "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms to density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too."(paragraph 2). we know we have a planet that is like earth can be one of the most exciting thing to know. we can survive on another earth is another.

If we were to ever go to venus we will be able to live there but with harsh conditions. As in the texts states "on the planet's surface, tempertaures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we have experience on out own planet." (paragraph3). normal weather to Venus is nothing compared to our earth. although they are alike.

Going to Venus would be dangerous but in realtiy if we don't go and study our earths twin we might not ever have the knowlege we can have by going. in the article it states "The value of returning to Venus seems indispoutalde, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive."(paragraph 4). if we don't try we won't learn anything new about what we don't have.

Having a earth as similar to earth can be exicting when it comes to studing it. going to a diferent planet with different condtions unlike ours can be dangerous also, not know what could have been known is a tough disicion.
