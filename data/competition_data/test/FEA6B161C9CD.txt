The advancement of technology has helped humanity a lot in several ways, such as comuters,phones or even, planes to travel the world. These advancements could help students to learn in school. The facial recognition mentioned in this article is amazing for the following reasons: it could give students an easier time understanding material, it could introduce new ideas into peoples minds about career oppurtunities, and it could draw students focus into their work.

This facial recognition could help students understand their material better by molding the lesson if the student is confused or bored or possible even distracted. This would be immensely helpful for students who may have trouble comprehending certain subjects like math or English. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson,like an effective humn instructor."

By shaping the lesson around the student it makes it more possible for a student to pass a class and graduate from highschool or college. If the student seems confused the lesson can slow down and work through the problem with them. If the student seems happy then the lesson can speed up and throw harder work at them.

Technology such as facial recognition in an acedemic situation could take the slowing down of harder classes and us that to drive new ideas of new technology into peoples heads. These programs could take calculus and make it to appleal to students with a mind for working with computers. This would open job oppurtunities for millions of people in the United States alone. It could take biology and slow the lesson to then advance it into so many different branches of biology.

Students get distracted; it's a thing that happens. what if it wasn't as easy to be distracted. what if your lesson shaped itsel ito something you liked because you undersood it, because you could make sense of what the lesson was about, and pllied it to real world situations. A lot of the reasons students get distracted is because they dont understand their subject or it's too hard so they stop to take abreak and dont come back to it baecause they know that they'll be just as confused when they come back to it as they were when they left. If your lesson slows down to incorporate your confused look or your stares of boredom it could mke the lesson easier to help you understand it which will in turn capture your attention again. I know multiple people who would love to have tis tech, myself included.

This would be an amazing advancemement in the acedemic worl but it's very far off. When this becomes widespread it would boost the economy of its country by a lot. I believe this technology would be beneficial for the following reasons: it would help students undertsand their material, it could introduce new ideas into peoples minds about career oppurtunities, and it could draw students focus into their work.
