I think policy one is good because at lunch students might what to ask there mom or dad for something. Phones need to be turned of during class for we wont be distracted from learning. And if the students have any problem at school if there sick or if someone is bullying them they can call there parents. We also need them to ask if we can go to are friends house after school or if we are going to stay at school late for a project. and we can call are parents to bring us money for we can eat lunch at school or they can bring us something. Phones are helpful from problems to keeping in touch with friends and family. Cell phones are good and bad there bad because some people can take advantage and use them during class and text there friends that are also in class and they are not going to learn. Some people may need phones just in case there is a family problem. That's what i think about phone use i think is good if we can use them during lunch or free time.
