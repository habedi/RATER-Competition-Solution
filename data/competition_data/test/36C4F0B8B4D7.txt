Dear TEACHER_NAME

I do not think that you should make all students perform community service it should be a optional thing. The reason it is optional is because some people just don't have the time. Take me for example i have to go home after school grab a quick bite to eat then i have to go play basketball or go to the gym. I used to even have to babysit. Other kids also have this problem that they don't have enough time to do any of this because of babysitting a lot of kids in our school have little brother and/or sisters and have to babysit after school. Witch makes it impossible to go do community service because by the time our parents get home we have to eat dinner then go do our homework and its already night time. Also it should be optional because some people just don't care about community service. Like when i say this i mean it nicely but i don't care about community service in my neighborhood all it is to me is more work and responsibilities i have to do. I would much rather hang out with my friends everyday and have a very fun athletic and social life. Then to go to community service everyday and just work. I know how bad it sucks to have community service because when i had to do 150 hours of it for court i hated it. I had to get up in the morning on my weekends and go work for hours and i get nothing out of it but some trash picked up off the ground witch wouldn't bother me even if it was there. So giving kids requirements to do community service would not be fair, but there is kids out there that for some odd reason like to do this so i think you should just have a sign up sheet and hold meetings about coming to community service on certain days to help out the community once in a while and the kids that want to help can help and the kids that have things to do and have plans to hang out with people and sleep out or have someone sleep in should not have to do it if they do not want to. I also think that if kids do sign up you can like bring them on a trip or two and have special meetings with them in school were they can get out of class like once or twice a month to just go eat like pizza or ice cream or even just to hang out and talk while using our phones and ipods. The reason i say this is because you will get more kids to sign up like the kids like me who will do it just to get out of class and socialize more because we are always finding newer and better ways to socialize and not get in trouble. Plus why not reward us for wanting to help out the community and for helping out the school and all the other people in the community. But no matter what community service should never be force on a kid for school it should only be forced on when they get in trouble with the law but i don't think even then but that will never change so it don't matter. so please do not make us all have community service just have a sign up sheet and the people who come can get special rewards and treats other students don't get.
