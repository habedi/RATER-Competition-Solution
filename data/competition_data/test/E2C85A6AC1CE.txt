Venus is one of our closest planets, we need to study it more due to the fact we could SOMEDAY JUST MAYBE, have humans on Venus. We need to be able to find things out about Venus dispite the dangers that could have potiental when studing Venus.

Dispite the dangers of Venus it is one of our twins, almost the same density and is one of our nieghbors in the atmosphere. The reason we study it is because it is one of the few planets that looks, acts and is close to the sun as Earth. NASA is also thinking of sending sciencetist to Venus to get a more up-close and personal view and too study how Venus reacts. You would have to be very brave to go on a different planet in my opinion. The down side is you cannot take photography on Venus because it could render the atmosphere and that could not end well for Venus. They are thinking of taking the computers in the old time due to the fact that they dont need electricity because they're powered by levers and such.

In conclusion, I believe we should not send humans to Venus quite yet, due to the dangers it could hold. I believe we should study it from a distance or send a robot and we could watch it on a camera see how Venus works, then maybe once we figure out how to keep the humans safe that land on the planet we can send humans to investigate on Venus more.
