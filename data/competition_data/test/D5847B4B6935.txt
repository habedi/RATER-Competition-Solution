Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hello TEACHER_NAME, I'm here to tell you about our school's cell phone policy. I had one in mind that I favored myself and I think you will too. Here's the policy: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. There are a few specific reasons I think this policy will please you and the students of our school.

For starters, in many cases phones are given to the son/daughter for emergency purposes. I for one, have received my phone for emergencies, but I've gotten my mom to consider it for full use. Several kids at every school have phones for this reason, and what if they don't have a ride home from school or they miss the bus? I understand you can use the office's phone, but waiting can be irritating for the impatient. Another reason is using phones during lunch or free time allows students to kill time. If they're on the phone, they're aren't doing anything mischievous or malicious. Believe it or not, phones can in some cases, can keep students out of shenanigans, shenanigans being either gangs/drugs.

Another example would be the fact that teenagers love to talk. I honestly mean the love to talk. They can't stop doing it, I myself do tend to talk excessively during in and out of school. Teenagers just have a natural tendency to gossip, talk, and just let their feelings out. In addition to that, if a teenager talks, there is a better chance they're happy. If they're happy, then they will try harder in school. Saying that, a miserable student will likely try to work bad at school. It's just the natural mentality of a teenager/student to think that they need a phone to be happy and/or occupied.

Well that's why I believe our school should take this policy in with open arms. If I would myself were allowed to use my phone during lunch or at free times, I would work that much more harder. Students allowed to use cell phones equals they work harder. Students that work harder equals happy you. Although the decision is up to you and you alone, I think you should choose this policy. I know for a fact that I would.
