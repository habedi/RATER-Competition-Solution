The "Face On Mars" is indeed just a natural landform. In the artile it says, "It is common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows."It is not an alien artifact. In the article it also says, "The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The "Face On Mars" is just an illusion.

If there were aliens then youl would see them when the camera took the picture. If aliens did make it we would have evedince on that because it has taken more then one picture. How would aliens get up there anyway? Or how would they survie there is no water, food, or animals.

I explained that it says it is just a shadow and it is nothing more then a rock that looks likes a face. On earth we find rocks that look like faces but we dont say that aliens made them. Where is the proof aliens made the "Face On Mars?" We did so much work on this topic and there is no proof aliens made it. No, we dont have proof that we didnt but there is more proof that there is not than there is.

The "Face On The Mars" is just a rock made up by the planet over time. Thank you for takeing your time to read my arguement over why the "Face On The Mars" is just a natural landform.
