I agree with the principal, kids need these extracurricular classes. Because after a long days of work, kids want to have fun and relax. First of all kids are full of energy, and parents want them to get it all out before they come home.

Secondly kids can have these extracurricular classes to get rid of their jitters, and have fun at the same time. lastly some kids are less hyper so we can have extracurricular like reading, coloring, photo journalism, etc. In conclusion kids will need these things to calm their nerve or to just chill and do whatever they want .

Sometimes kids are given ice cream or sugary drinks and food at school and the kids will get hyper. They need these things to help them work out the sugar in their bodies. Like sports can help by making them run around and making them tired and get rid of the jitters. in conclusion going to do the extracurricular activities or something can get rid of their jitters out of their systems .

Some kids parents want them to get their jitters out before coming home, but the kids just sometimes want to wait to play with their parents. So kids can go run around and play with friends play games and stuff at school in the extracurricular activities. If kids do these than when they go home they can go to sleep and not bother their parents. in conclusion kids are crazy when they get home so if they get it out at school than they get rid out their energy they wont annoy their parents .

Kids that are calm and quiet are not really active and don't want to do sports. So they can join extracurricular that are calm also like coloring . They can also do reading,yearbooks,and photo journalism or something they like. In conclusion some kids want to do sports and some don't in the extracurricular classes they can do whatever they like .

Kids will need to let out their energy or else they will be bouncing off the walls with so much energy. Some kids would like to let that energy out so they go to the extracrrecular classes. Some kids ant to just chill so they go to these classes where they can do both. In condition I agree with the princapal they should put extracurricular classes for those hyper and non hyper kids .
