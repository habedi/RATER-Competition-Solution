Dear Principal,

The following change in the school policy, in my opinion would be a positive change. Although the majority of the students have a C average, a required B to be in after school activities would make more sense.

Truthfully , if a student really wanted to participate in an after school activity they would keep there grade up to the appropriate standard. I mean sports shouldn't take away from a students education, a high academic grade should be a students main priority. Plus if the parent or legal guardian found out his or her child wasn't passing at a proper grade average , they will complain to the school board on how their child isn't getting the "proper learning skills" they need, when more then likely the student being to occupied with after school activities or other things.

Even though automatically taking the kid out of the team or club he or she is participated in is an option there are other options the school can use as well. Teachers can give the student make-up work to bump up there grade, the school can hold an after school intervention to give students the extra help they need in the first place, or the councilor can call the specific student into their office and give them a warning of what could happen in the future if they don't work harder in school or just straight up ask "why are your grades so low?" , and move on from there. Plus the student isn't necessarily getting low grades because of sports, the sports issue is just the conclusion a lot of people jump to. What if the student is having family problems , or what if the student is getting bullied, or other things outside of school , or they just don't understand that a certain subject, maybe he or she is just to lazy to the homework in the first place , there are a million reasons why someone would be to busy or non-focused on homework or class work.

In conclusion , having a B average would be a appropriate change in the school policy , but before just booting the student out of his or her after school club or activity , try and get down to the main point of why he or she isn't focused on there education. Thank-you for taking your own time for reading this, and I hope you take this under consideration. I like to know their opinion is taken under consideration.

Sincerely ,

Student
