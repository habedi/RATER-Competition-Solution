Dear Principal,

There are many different opinions about community service. Some individuals think you should be required to do it, but the others may think opposite. In my own opinion, I believe that you should have the option on whether or not to do community service. Helping people and the community is very important, but some people don't have the time to do so.

Some people may have sports, while others may have all the time in the world. It would be great to encourage students to take part in it at least once a week, or maybe even once a month, but not everyday. Most children enjoy fun activities, and to some of the children this is not fun.

If you require students to perform community service, there would be a lot of complaints. You might even have children not liking school or doing things they are not supposed to.

I think we should encourage students that they can make their own decisions to prepare them for the future. Forcing them will not do any good.

I do agree that community service is very good, and many people should take part in it, but some people just don't enjoy doing activities as such. Would you like being forced to take part in an activity you didn't like? I wouldn't.

I hope you take my opinion to good concern. I presume that you would be happy with just making community service an option. I will be happy with whatever you choose, but just know that making it an option will develop good reactions.

Sincerely,

Your Student
