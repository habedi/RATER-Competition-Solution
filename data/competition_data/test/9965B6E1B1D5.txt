Dear TEACHER_NAME

Having cell phones at school would be a good idea.

They would be a good idea because if you don't allow to have phones at school then they might get hurt by someone.

If she or he was too be walking home or riding a bike home then how would they be able too call for help if they were attacked.

Plus it would make students happier.

If the students are happier then they would want to do there work more and more.

Then it would just be a cycle of events accruing in our school.

If you gave them the opportunity to have phones then they would respect you more as a person.

There wouldn't be any issues with phones being out at the wrong time if you just have an assembly and set the ground rules so they.

Next if you need your home work that you left at home then you can just text your mom in the morning.

This would prevent you from getting a bad grade.

Also if you forget your lunch then you don't have stave.

You can just call your dad or mom to come bring it to you.

And if you are hungry then your not going to be focused on what your doing in class.

Then the teacher will be mad at the student and then you would have to deal with them.

Over all that would just make your job harder.

Then if your job is harder you will start aging faster and faster until you just lose your mind.

Then you'll start to get a divorce and your life will start spiraling down and down until you hit rock bottom.

As i was saying i think having students to be able to have phones at school would be great and benefit all of us.

Sincerely, student
