Every student needs to, at least, practice one community service task at which they choose. It would help our community be a better place and be good for kids to get out of the house and know they can do something also. Whenever you do a task, it makes you feel good inside knowing that you did something to help someone or something else. Some examples of this would be- babysitting, picking up trash, mowing a yard, or even something simple like helping a neighbor organize books or movies. All of those simple deeds can make someone happy and you may even get you something nice in return like chocolate, a meal, or even a simple and sweet hug.

Yes, it can take time away from hanging out with friends or going to a movie with someone special, but why not ask them to you do it along with you. It would make the task easier and not take up a lot of time. Knowing that you have someone there that will always help you and that you have a good time with, can make the job less boring than if you were doing it by yourself. With a friends help, it can decrease the hours and amount of work spent on that task. A friend can also make working more fun and can also tell you that no matter what they are there for you and want to be with you so they would do anything to make that happen. They might even tell you that whenever you want to do another task just ask them because they had a great time and want to do it again sometime.

I think community service should be required so kids our age don't have time to deal with other bad things like drugs. Instead, we can focus on making our community a better place to live and be, while not worrying about what it should be.
