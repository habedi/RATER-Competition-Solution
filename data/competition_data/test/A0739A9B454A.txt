Dear Principal:

I am writing on behalf of the kids at our school and the effect of changing the school policy would be on them. Many kids are at a C average in their grades, and can participate in sports. If the policy is changed to a minimal B average requirement, then many students will not be able to participate in sports or other activities. The school policy should not be changed because it would be a lot harder for kids to compete in after school activities, a less amount of students would be representing the school, and there wouldn't be as much control without the influence of extracurricular activities.

Education does come before extracurricular activities. Kids represent the schools in numerous academic ways, including the core subjects. The amount of work given to students is already discouraging and many do not do their best on it, but find they do great in the extracurricular activities. Schools are represented more by kids who are in sports or are in other activities.

Changing the school policy would make it harder for kids to be in sports and other activities. Many kids already find that school is challenging and therefore do not put their best effort into their schoolwork as they do to other activities. We cannot change that fact and it would be silly to punish other kids who get a C average, but that is the best that they can do. Sports and other activities are crucial to the development of the future adults of America.

Changing the school policy would make it so less students represent the schools in other ways besides academics. All kids are not science or mathematical geniuses. They are just regular, average kids who find joy in the extracurricular activities that the school has to offer. A student may not be great in one thing, but may be amazing at another. Why would we want to hurt the development of the students who may find a future career in something other than academics.

If the school policy was changed, then there would be less control and order in the schools. Many kids come from bad homes, and the extra activities offered at school allow them to feel like they fit in and that they can succeed in whatever they do. We are building the future youth of America and changing the school policy would change the future. The extra activities are helpful to stimulate the young minds and keep them out of trouble.

The school policy should not be changed because it would be a lot harder for kids to compete in after school activities, a less amount of students would representing the school, and their wouldn't be as much control without the influence of extracurricular activities. School is a vital place in helping to develop the minds of the youth, but also to help them grow and succeed. Many kids rely on school and raising the policy to a B average would discourage many students. Lets keep the policy the same and continue to help the future leaders of this great country.

Thank you,

A student
