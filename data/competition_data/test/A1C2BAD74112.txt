Driverless Cars , imteresting topic and idea . Many people say " Driverless cars will lower accedents " or " They drive and we txt and talk " Simple as it gets right? Wrong lets keep it simple we're becoming lazy and slowly losing our culture . everything is becoming automatic nothing is done by hand . If you wanna know what the weather is like you look at your phone , how about you step outside to see if it is cold or hot . Another case we need to gain back our culture and becoming the people that say " lets do this " and lets not be the people that say " Lets let them do it " we are becoming more dependable on technology more than ever . its to the point were we are at driverless cars? come on people , we might as well have driverless NASCAR then if people dont wanna drive . NASCAR is boring enough but lets put robots behind the wheel and see what happens. Instead of focusing on ways to improve ways to sit back and relax how about we find ways for us to improve our cars instead of having someone drive them for us . Take pride in your car , Take pride in your country , Take pride in your self.

Another topic of the matter , when you get your first car its a great feeling you can drive around with your friends and turn up the radio and have a fantastic time . but think of it this way , you get picked up by a car driven by a robots , this robot can't hold a conversation , this robot can't dance with you and talk about funny jokes and then go out to dinner with yah and eat with yah . But you can do all that your frinds,family or even a guy that you just meet or even a new girlfriend ! times should be kept simple and easy and fun , not controlled by a non memory making robot . Remeber your memories and remeber your non robotic car .
