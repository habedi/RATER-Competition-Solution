Would you like to have a computer driving you everywhere all the time? Well that is exactly what most vehicle manufacturers are working on, anf the stide they are making in the tech are amazing. But is a fully automated vehicle really what the world needs?

I agree that the idea of a car driving itself is really cool and would be benificial to humanity, but a fully automated car just won't do. A car that moves on its own all the time is bound to mess up, especially when there is something unforseen in the road like a car you have been tailing for awhile suddenly brakes to avoid hitting a deer anf you smash into the rear of his car because the computer couldn't react fast enough.

That is why I propose we make cars that are half automatic and halfhuman controlled. That would be great, imagine that same scenario, but this time instead of trusting the car to brake on its own, you stomp your foot on that brake and the car stops.

I'm not saying we shouldn't have self driving cars, i'm just saying adding the ability for the human in the front seat to take over couldn't hurt, might even help save lives.
