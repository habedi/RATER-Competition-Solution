Everybody may be have different opinion for everything,including the emotional expressions. When we at happy time to see that could be a smile photo. When we at med time to see that could be a angry photo and so on. We can not actually know what is the real expression from this painting. But computer can help us to recognize the subtle facial movements.

One reason is''Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists,such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System).Eckman has classified six bisic emotions--happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.''There have six bisic emotions on computer can help us to recognize the subtle facial movements. Another reason is ''A classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr. Huang predicts. So that evidenced computer can recognize the emotional expressions of the students in the classroom is valuable.

By the way,people recognize the emotional expressions depented on themself at what time to see the expressions,but computers can ''calculater''that for sure. In my opinion, computer can help us to recognize the emotional expressions.
