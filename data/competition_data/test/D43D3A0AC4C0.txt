Dear Principal,

I understand that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I realize that you are considering two policy. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. And, not allowing students to us cell phones at all at school. I think that you should allow students to use the cell phones during free time.

I believe that you should allow students to use their cell phones. If they can use their cell phones during free time they won't have the urge to use the cell phones during class. When they use them during free time they talk to all the people that want to talk to. Some people don't get to see their friends during free time so they will most likely call or text to their friends during free time. If they cant call or text during free time at all they will try to text during class so that they can talk. If students cant bring their cell phones to school then they could not use their phone for after school activities or an emergency.

There are some disadvantages to letting students use their cell phones during free time. One, letting them use their cell phones during free time makes them want to text or call more so, they might do it during class. ii they do that then it will take away from their learning.

It could go either way on this decision. But, being a student i would like to be able to use my cell phone during free time. I also do a lot of after school activities so, i wouldn't be able to call my mom for a ride if i needed one. I think the parents would choose policy one because some parents like to keep in touch with their children.
