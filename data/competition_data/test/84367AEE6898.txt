I think that students will benefit from being able to attend classes online.

The reason i support this question is because some student are not able, to attend school during the day or night time for example; in others country or this can happen in any country, Some students have to work all day for pay bills or help there family buy food, clothes, etc. or they live alone with brothers and sisters and is difficult for them to have a education because they have to work for take care of there family.

Sometimes student have to go out of town or flight to others country and they have to get out of school for days or months and that is the bad thing about that because, if you mess a lot of day you can fail you classes or don't graduate on time. The good thing about online classes is that after work or when you have free time you can go online and do your work or video conference with the person you taking you classes.

Things about the online classes is that, if you can't go to school you can take it at home or any place you want, they only thing you have to got is a computer or phone internet or you can go to a public library and also if you are taking the video conference class you need a computer with camera that's all. For that i think that school that got online classes or video conference classes can help a lot of student to graduate and have a better future, or better life and they can work and help there family at the same time.

Also for adult if they don't finish school at time they can take oline classes, also if you graduated from school you can take a carrier online, and is not necesary to attend to college you can work in whatever you working and study online the classes, online is the best way for people that can not attend to school or people that work all day or travel always to study and got a GED
