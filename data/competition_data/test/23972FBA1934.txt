In some schools students are available to offer distance learning as an option. Do you thing students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I believe that it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home.

Some school have distance learning programs for students to attend classes from home, and that is helpful for students to get an extra time to work on. like in some classes students need to finish their work in limited time and this can make students a little stressful, but in distance learning program students can have enough time to work on.

In this world every person has it`s own dream for the future to be in a perfect way of life. For example some people wants to be a Doctor, Engineer, Athlete, and others want to be Astronaut. However, you have a dream if you are not educated it is so difficult to achieve your dream. In this way if people need to educated to achieve their dream it is impossible to go to school for all person in this world in lots of reasons, like some people live in far from school, do not have enough money to go to school, having apart time job for living, and other reasons can affect their dreams.

On the other hand if students have distance learning program it is not easy to work on assignments and homeworks like students that are able to learn in school, because students that take classes at home do not have teachers and classmates that they can make things more easier to understand by giving examples and more explanations.

In my opinion it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home. In conclusion having distance learning programs in schools for is most beneficial for students. So schools should have offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, and also students should not give up if they do not have way to go to school or if they are not able to take classes in the school, because they can attend for distance learning program and make their dream achievable, and schools should pay their own role to make achievable students dream.
