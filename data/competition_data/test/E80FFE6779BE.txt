Can you Deal with taking a life and living in regret for the rest of your life?

Well think about this is driving and texting really needed....is that message you sending so important that you could spend the rest of your life behind bars?

Texting and driving is illegal in almost every state you can think of because of so many incidents were some has been hurt or critically injured because your hand was on your phone and not on the wheel. Texting is a everyday thing for us we have to tweet and reply to comments but at what cost. If you sitting down on the couch and texting that's fine or even riding with someone who driving as long as you are in the passenger seat and not distracting them so they can keep they eyes on the rode.

Do you think that your life is important to live? Let's take a break and think about it .....if you are crossing the street with your daughter or family member maybe even just you and you happen to see a car that is just speeding but they pick up they phone because they got a message in a hot second your life is taken away or put in danger because of that driver your family would hate them and be heart broken over your loss. Now think about this if the roles were reverse and you were behind that wheel and there a kid crossing the street just enjoying there life happy go lucky and because your boyfriend or mommy send you a message like i miss you , where are you , come pick me up or something in that nature and you decide to respond to it then BOOM you hit that kid. For the rest of your life you will have to deal with that pain and constant flash backs.

I personally don't believe that people should be able to use there phone while operating a motor vehicle . The average percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were they were distracted by their cell phones is 21% . Even though that's not a high percent it's alot of hurt for the parents victim and the driver of that vehicle cause not only are you putting your sure in danger you putting that victim at risk of loosing there life to. The average percent of kid's and adults admitting they still text and drive is 35% that mean over 35% of kids around the world is texting and driving everyday putting their life and our life in jeopardy to.

In Conclusion tell me do you think texting and driving should be legal or illegal ...make sure you think about it hard cause next time it could be you or someone you know. Always check the facts and let someone know they could end their life by just one stupid mistake . You have the choice to do right after reading this essay to live your life to the fullest of have it cut short by a car hitting you or you hitting someone or being sentenced to life or even worse death . Please save a life by spreading this message because everyday we here of a hit and run stop texting and save a life.
