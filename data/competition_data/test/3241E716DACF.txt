Long ago, Vikings spotted a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. It was about two miles long and was located on a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some people are convinced that aliens on the Red Planet, but others would beg to differ. Most scientists agree that aliens are just a myth and they did not build the "face. Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he "face."

For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the "face" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this "face" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face." Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.

Still not satisfied with my argument? If not, listen to this. With all of the new technology these days, there is even more proof as to why there was no aliens who built the "face." A camera took photos of the "face" with maximum resolution. With the high technology cameras, scientists could look at the photo three times as large as the origianl snapshot. Becasue the scientists can zoom in so much, they would have been able to see if there were any aliens on the planet. The picture actually shows Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, which are llandforms commonly located around American West.

Most scientists would agree that there never was alien life on Cydonia. Thanks to technology, this point can be proven even further. Obviously, aliens did not build the "face" that is on the Red Planet.
