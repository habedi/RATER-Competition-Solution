Principal:

I have become aware that you are thinking about taking away cell phone use at school altogether. I would encourage you to use your first policy which is to only allow students to bring their cell phones to use at lunch and free periods, but not in the middle of a learning period. With our generation being so technologically advanced, I think we should use these tools to our advantage and not try to make them an enemy. By the time students of this school have their own families and jobs, the cell phone will be used everywhere and for everything, if they do not invent something even more advanced. I think that if you are still concerned about the students using their phones during school, you should put a bucket in every classroom where each student puts their cell phone in with their name on a post it note attached to the cell phone that is theirs. They use this strategic move in Congress when they are having a meeting and from my understanding, it seems to work. If students fail to follow this rule, the cell phone should no longer be a privilege to said student for the rest of the semester. I think that if we take away the cell phones completely the students will try and most likely succeed in smuggling them into school. There also might be some parents who are so outraged that they can not reach their child to tell them who is picking them up after school or if they are walking, that they will transfer their students to a different school district who allows them to use their cell phones. If I am right, you get a certain amount of money per student you have at school, so losing a couple of students not only mean losing a couple of bodies in the classroom, but also losing money that could be put towards furthering students education.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
