Dear Principal,

I personally believe that all students should be required to do community service. I feel that students at our school take to much advantage of what they have and don't realize what others in our community have to go through.

For example, the homeless barely have anything at all and students are lucky enough to have a roof over their heads and food to enjoy everyday. If we as a student body go occasionally to the homeless shelters and feed the homeless we will see what we have and will learn not to take advantage of the things that we have.

Another example is spend our time with elderly people. The elderly are often neglected and taken advantage of just because they are considered "old" and are just not respected anymore. This little act of kindness can show how when students are that age or if the situation comes when we must take care of the elderly, we will realize how we must respect and we will be respected.

One last example is visiting children in the hospital. Spending time with sick kids can show how lucky we are to be healthy and not watch our families suffer through our pain and struggle for our lives. We the students will learn that we shouldn't complain and be grateful for everything in our lives.

Basically what I'm trying to say here is that we as students don't realize how lucky we are and how we should learn by doing community service. If you do not decide to give us a required community service please remind the student body how lucky we are and how kindness is very useful in life. Thank you for your time and have a great day.

From,

A Helpful Student
