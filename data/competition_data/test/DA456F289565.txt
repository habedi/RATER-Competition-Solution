Exploring Venus is brilliant but on the other hand there are many dangers when it comes to studying it. In order to get samples of anything researches would have to go to Venus but it's not garented they will make it back to Earth, so they have to come up with a better idea because studying Venus is worth it especially since Venus is an Earth-like planet.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus could be the next palnet there is life on. If the researches discover that life could be held on Venus people could start traveling there and try to research more of the surface of Venus. " Long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth" (Paragraph 4). There is a chance of life on Venus so thats why the author states that researching Venus is worthy despite the dangers.

Another way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers is that many reseachers are woking on making machine last long and doing some testing on them to see if the machines do last longer. " Many researches are working on innovations that would alow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus" (paragraph 6). Those machines could study Venus for the reseachers and they wouldn't have to send anyone and risk the dangers.

Exploring Venus is a great idea but researchers should look for other things like machines, or create their own one that could survive the heat and Venus conditions so they don't have to send people and put them in danger because they don't really know what it's like there. If reserches put in hard work and study all of Venus, Venus could be the next Earth.
