If you were told that you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, how would you feel? While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them. Schools shouldn't take away student's after school time, that time is the only time that they get to relax.

Schools have a limited option of extracurricularÂ activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.

A lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.

After school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.

With all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.
