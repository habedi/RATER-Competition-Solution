If I were Luke Bomberger I would convince people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it's such an experince.

When you are doing your job not only are you working, you are helping other people and it gives you that good feeling down inside. As you are doing you rounds or trips or whatever you want to call it is a great opertunity for a young boy or grown man to see alsorts of stuff, like different cultures and different countrys. Another reason is your an animal lover you got yourself a job but remember one thing you do need to be strong and tuff. If you are worried about being board trust me we have loads of stuff to help you pass time some of the stuff includes, Table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games so you dont half to worried about being bored.

There are some great dangers about being on sea. On my second trip I served as a watchman . My jod was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night I was makeing my hourly report to the captin and I slid down the slipery ladder and landed on my back side. I was happey to be alive. The one problem was that I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. You shouldent have that problem.

Well thats realy all I can say. Yes I agree it dose have its downfalls but thers more good things than bad I can personley tell you that. It realy helped me open my mind to the world. It helped me understand the problems other countries were facing and I realy hope it helps you open up your mind. With all my information I hope to see you at sea helping the animals.
