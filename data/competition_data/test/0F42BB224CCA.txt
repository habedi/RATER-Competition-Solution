Today in class I read a article on "Driveless Cars Are Cming. I will be writing to tell you if I am against the delevopmet of these Cars. Or I will also be writing to tell you if I am not against the delevopment of these cars.

I am not against the delevopment of these cars because people get the change to see what is like to get in the car and not have to drive themselves around because the car do it for them. They also get the change to see what techonogly can do with a car. I am also not against the driverless car because the car have sensors on them and they are still able to do somethings with the car. Such as Pulling the car in or out the driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navgating through roadwork or accidents because the car will alert them to.

I think this is a good thing because within in 10 years the sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger out-of-control skids or rollover. This is a good thing because no one will get hurt while being in the car. The sensors on the car can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine which is a good thing so the car stop at stop signs, red lights, and when someone is crossing the street. Reducing the power of the engine is a good thing because the car will slow down when it need to.

In conclusion, In my writing I told you about why I am not against the development of thses cars. In my writing I give the detail why I am not against the development of these cars and why I think it was a good idea to make the cars.
