Should drivers be able to be on their devices while operating a vehicle? Even tho cell phones today sources to everything now from just communicating with people long distance to the internet to also getting around. In the times of today people would even walk across the street looking because they are distracted by their phones. Which is saying if people that are walking don't even pay attention to where they're walking or if they are about to get hit by a car drivers would do the same if they were on their phones.

It's will be difficult for most people to stay focused on the roads if they were able to use their phones and to drive at the same time. It has became a habit today to not be able to stay off of your phones. Apple has updated phones to where when you're driving it won't send notifications and will lock your phone for you so you won't have to become distracted. The only that will work while you're driving if needed is the gps of maps. A good idea for people who also get distracted and for teenage drivers the group that gets in the most accidents so it'll be helpful for them too when on the road.

Eventually, new models in cars is driving hands-free not always hands free but for a quick second or even a minute. Drivers aren't able to look away from their phones even when their phones are locked they have to just to see if a notification has popped up on their phones. It has become a little bit of a good idea so the driver and other's could be safe on the road, worried that drivers may abuse the power of the hands free control button and not use it responsibility and things can still lead to accidents. It's not much people can do to stop people from using their phones while driving because people are addicted and are willing to take the risks to look at one simple message.

Therefore drivers shouldn't be allowed to be on their phones while operating a vehicle so they won't put themselves and others in danger of being killed on the road. There are laws and even phone companies are trying to do something about it so other won't be in harm. It's also the drivers choice either they follow or not hopefully to actually encourage driver's to be cautious of accidents and who they might hurt.
