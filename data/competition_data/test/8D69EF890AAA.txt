Dear ,Principal i think that you should let students with at least a C average to participate in sports or after school activities. i say this because a lot of students have high C' s and average B' s and low A' s. this means that a lot of students would not be able to participate in these activities and it is not fair. it is not fair because lots of students want to participate and want to have at least one chance with this. that would at least be very fair. also what i think is fair is if they get the chance, but the one rule should be you can only stay in the after school sport or activity if you keep the grades the same or if they get better. but the you should get kicked out of the team or sport if you do not keep the grades then same way or better. also another rule is if you are disrespectful or rude you will also be kicked of the team. this is what i think about people having a B average and being in after school activities and sports.

Sincerely. . . . .
