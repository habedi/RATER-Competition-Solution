Dear principal,

I believe you should choose Policy 1 for a few reasons. Some students have a long walk from home to school, or bus stop to home. These students need cell phones for their own safety. next, just face it. No matter how hard you try to enforce the rules, there are still going to be those sneaky students who have their cell phones out at lunch, during passing time, and even during class. If you allow us to have phones out during lunch and passing time the students will slowly stop texting in class because they will know what's going on with their friend from out of state. They wont feel the need to text during class because they would have got the whole conversation "out of their system" before class. If they get caught during class you can make the consequences more brutal and you would have reasons for them such as "I let you have them out during lunch and passing time, and that should be enough" or "You're lucky i' m even letting you have them at school". It all just takes time. With patience comes great reward. You will have to deal with less frustrated or annoyed parents asking why their child cant have their phone back until May. In other words, you'll be more relaxed with the few students and parents you have to deal with instead of all the repeated rule breaking texters begging everyday for their phone back. Lets just go over this. If you allow cell phones out at lunch and passing time, you wont have to deal with texting in class, angry parents, or begging students. Your life will be a whole lot easier, so just change one simple rule for us all.
