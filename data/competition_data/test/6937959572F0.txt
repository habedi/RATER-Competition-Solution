Summer is the only 3 months of the year that you dont have to wake up first thing in the morning and go to school. Summer is what every student is looking forward to. The thought of a 3 month break just keeps students pushing through the year, We work so hard during the school year, and finally, we get to relax during summer.

There is only one major problem with summer. Since it is over a extended period of time of 3 months, kids do not remember all the lessons and all the information that they had learned over the 9 months they were in school. Of course we still have the knowledge in our heads. We just need to be reminded, or do semi-frequent reviews on things you did during the school year. All of the important things with stay in your head if you remind it to not forget the things you have put in it.

Every student thinks differently and has different mind sets. Sometimes kids forget all of what they learned during the school year, just over 3 months. But when they are reminded of all of the things they had learned it is refreshed. But their just isnt enough time during the school year, to both refresh your brain from last years lessons, and teach you all of the lessons for this year.

There are a many of ways to solve this problem, but not everyone should have the same solution. Different students take a certain amount of time, and a certain amount of energy put into them. To keep all of the lessons fromÂ the previous year refreshed. The solution has to be found by the student not the teacher.

One option brought up by teachers, You must have homework over the summer. For example summer projects or review packets from the previous year. But, students should have a say on this, after all we have been slaving away for 9 months. All the students want is a break. But they will have the opportunity to either keep learning during the summer or just do these projects or packets as reviews so they are all caught up and ahead of the game for the upcoming school year.

After all it us the students break, They should be the ones deciding their projects. However much effort they want to put in, is how much they get out these projects. But these projects would keep you up to date and if you really wanted to you could go further and learn ahead.

If these projects were teacher based, It would feel as if you are still in school. Giving the student the freedom of creating and picking their own project makes then feel like they are doing these projects fun. Because some summer days can get very boring. These projects that the student either picked or created is helping them both learn more and review from the previous school year. They will not forget as much of the information they put so much time and effort into getting in their brain, they do not want to lose it.

It would be better if these "summer projects" were not projects but just seldom reviews. Just every one in a while go review or look over your old text books, that way you will not have to be reminded during the school year and waste time and effort. Just a couple times a week during the summer, you will be refreshed of all the things you learned that were in that text book.
