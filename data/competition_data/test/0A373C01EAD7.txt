I believe students shouldn't have to participate in any extracurricular activity. Here is why I disagree, some students have to go home and take care of a sibling or grandparent, a student may have had a bad day or they might not have time to stay for the activity, and many students already stress enough with school. So why make it worse?

One reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, many students have to take care of their sibling or grandparent. For example, a student might have to go home and make food for a younger sibling because their parents are working and it is their job to care for them. Another example is, a student may have a grandparent that lives with them that is not very mobile or they simply can't take care of themselves.

A Second reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, a student may have had a bad day at school and they probably want to go home but can't. For example, failing a test can be very hard on students sometimes because they know it might affect their grade which could instantly ruin their day. Another example is, some students don't have time because they might have a sport outside of school or they might have a family problem and need to get home once school finishes.

A Third reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, school is very stressful for us students because we are expected to learn everything very quick and to have good grades but sometimes we just need time to relax. Another example is, forcing a student to do an extracurricular activity like a sport or serving on student council can make us start dreading school more than we already do.

These are the reasons why I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in any extracurricular activityÂ because students have siblings or grandparents to take care of, having a bad day or having no time for after school, and school make students stress a lot. Students have responsibilities and lives out of school we can't forget that.
