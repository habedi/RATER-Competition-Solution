When thinking of summer many envision days by the pool, relaxing and having fun. Although, over summer many high school students are assigned summer projects to assure schools that the students are continuing to learn over break. This forces students to take time out of their day to stress over and complete work that they already don't want to do based on subjects they have no interests in. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would show their creativity and be more student-based; however, some may disagree.

Summer projects being student-designed would help show the teacher the creativity of the student. The student could choose anything to write about while having fun doing it. This could help the student learn even more which is what the schools try to assure that students are doing over break. For example, if a kid goes to an interesting place such as Generic_City;for vacation, then, they would have the chance to create a project based all around the trip. They could draw the place and have little captions that go along with it or create a comic strip based on them and their summer adventures. Students learn more when they are creative and this is the perfect way to show it.

When doing a summer project, a student-designed project would be better since it would be more student-based. The student would have the chance to think of what they want to do their project on and the teacher would mainly have no say.

They would assure the schools that the students are learning because typically students do better when they have projects on subjects that spike their interests. An example of a summer project being student-based would be a student that spends all their time playing video games or hiking and them coming up with ways to present it. They could write about it, make a scrap book or even create a documentary. The student could honestly do whatever since the project is based around them. Students respond better to work when it is based on their experiences and is interesting.

Although many believe that summer projects should be student-designed, there are many pros to them being teacher-designed. Teachers are normally organized and by giving out summer work, it helps show students what the teacher expects out of them. Over summer, I was assigned an English project and it helped that the teacher had specific details and examples showing what they expected out of me. I feel like it helped me learn more about how the teacher taught, while also being able to learn about current events in the world. With summer projects being teacher-based it helps show the teacher what they will have to actually teach and what they can just review with the students.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed since it would benefit the student by being able to show the teacher what they are capable of while also having a something that initiates their fuel to learn. Although many may disagree, students would rather have something that has to do with their interests compared to another project that completely bores them. Teacher-based projects force the students to do work while, student-based projects want to complete their work and have a good time while doing so.

Therefore, schools should require students to complete student-designed summer projects.
