As most of you may most likely know, whether it be through media or a friend, the 1976 Viking 1 spacecraft photographed what appeared to be a face in the Cydonia region on Mars. This so called face was created by shadows of rocks that made the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. In actuality, that's all this face is: an illusion. Many of us scientists are convinced that this "Face on Mars" is only just a mesa, although some of my fellow peers (as well as conspiracy theorists) are convinced that this face is a sign of alien life. In order to disprove the notion that the Face on Mars is in fact a sign of alien life, we (NASA) photographed the same mesa in the Cydonia region once more on April 5, 1998 using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) which had a higher resolution camera than the Viking 1. This should have convinced the public and conspiracy theorists that the so called Face on Mars was only an illusion, as the photograph showed no face and only vague rocks and indents in the surface of the mesa, but no avail. They claimed that since it was cloudy when the picture was taken, it was covering up what the Face on Mars was supposedly hiding. So we set out to prove the conspiracy theorists wrong once and for all. On April 8, 2001 a final photograph was taken of the Face on Mars. This time, we used an even higher resolution camera (at 1.56 meters per pixel) on the MGS. What appeared was the exact same picture as we had taken in 1998. Alas, no one was satisfied and to this day conspiracy theorists still question that the Face on Mars is a mesa. Actually, the mesa that had the Face on Mars on it resembles many of the mesas we have here on Earth. As Garvin stated, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho". Another piece of evidence for the face being a mesa is that in the 2 photos following the original in 1976, the face was no where to be seen. If th conspiracy theorists were right, than the MGS photographs would have shown a face and even alien symbols as some theorists claimed those would be some of the markings in the face. Unfortunately for them, all that showed up on the images were rocks and indents. In conclusion, base on all of the evidence gathered throughout 25 years about the Face on Mars, all evidence points to it being a mesa. From the illusion it created once, but never recreated to the resemblance of the Mesa to ones found here on Earth.
