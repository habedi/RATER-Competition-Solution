There are several different benefits of limiting car usage. Diesel fuel from cars tend to polute the air, so the less people use cars the less air pollution there will be. People will walk more than they did before with the limitations of car usage. The roads will also have less "congestion" or car traffic. These benefits are very helpful in many ways as to why car usage should be cut back for a while.

Over the years, air pollution has become a big problem everywhere. It basically poisons us with the air we breathe. When you have restrictions or limitations on car usage, it will help a lot because the less toxis chemicals you have in the air, the healthier it is for everybody, and the more safer the environment is.

Another benefit of limiting the car usage is people will walk more than they ever had before. For example, you usually don't walk unless you really have to, like when you're going shopping, walking a dog, or walking in school. But when you have a car and you're trying to get to a destination that's walking distance, you'll tend to get lazy and just drive that short amount of distance instead. We as humans don't walk until we actually HAVE to. Other examples as in, going to the grocery store to pick up a few things, walking the dog, mowing the lawn, etc. So the limitation on cars will help SO much more because it will actually MAKE people walk.

When you live in over-populated areas, congestion happens a lot. Congestion in this situation means car traffic. Congestion is very time consuming sometimes because the more traffic there is, the less time you have to complete a task you were planning on doing. Less cars on the road is a very good benefit to limitating car usage, a benefit to time, and a benefit to people on every level.

These are some of the benefits of limiting car usage. The air we breathe will be less polluted by a LOT, people will excersize and walk more, and there will be less congestion (car traffic), which will save more time. These benefits will help everyone in many different ways.
