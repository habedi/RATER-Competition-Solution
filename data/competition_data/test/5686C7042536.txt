i do not think that you should make all students perform community service. not everybody has the time too. and if we don't want to do it they we should not be pushed into doing it. some kids rather go play sports or go fish or hunt not everybody wants to go do community service. i know i don't want to have to do community service. on the weekend I'm fishing or hunting or playing sports like baseball and football. i would not like to give up my time and what I'm doing to go do community service. and I'm sure their are lots of student that feel the same way i do.

why make student do stuff they don't want too do. if i was the principle i wouldn't make them all do it. i would ask for people who want to do it come make a group and they can do it on the weekends. it is something that takes place outside of school so you cant make use do it if we don't want to.
