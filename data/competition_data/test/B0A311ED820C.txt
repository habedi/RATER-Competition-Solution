I strongly beleve in distance learning. Distance learning is a great thing for students who are sick and don't want to miss any thing in there classes. This is also a great thing for students that are disabled it can be hard for them to get out of the house some times, so why not provide them with distance learning. Students on vacation also benifet from this because they are away from school and might not want to miss anything. Distance learning is most defenatly a great thing for students to have.

I have been sick and had to miss school many times in my life. If something like distance learning was avalable to me I could have miss no work. This would reduce my stress level and would do the same for many students. For students who get sick a lot this could help them catch up easly and not be as stressed. Students who get sick a lot are not the only once who would get to benifet from distance learning.

Disabled students would also greatly benifet from distance learning. For many disabled students it can be hard to even get to school. Many disabled people have a much harder time than the rest of us, but if something like distance learing was avalable they could go to class from there beds or homes. This would be a huge waight off there sholders if they could do school from home. Disabled people and people who get sick a lot are no the only once distance learning can help it can also help students who go on vacation.

When people go on vacation they usally want to say clear of things like school, but once they get back and have a pile of work to do they will not enjoy it at all. Distance learning can releve the stress they will most defantly will feel after there vacation. Students can still enjoy there vacation while doing some work. All in all distance learning is a great thing for students, but some claim it is a bad thing and should be left alone.

many people don't like the idea of distance learning. these people are wrong in saying that, They claim that if a student is sick they should rest. this point is invaled because if distent learming were a thing they would be able to do it at there own past. they might also say that if a student is on vacation they are having a brake and should be left alone. this is also incorrect if they wanted to go on vacation and take a brake they should have gone during one of the built in brakes the school provides.

Distance learning should defanatly be provided to students. It should be provided for disabled students with limmited mobilaty. Distance learning should be there for students who get sick regularly. There should be distance learning for students who go on vacation. When you really think about it, distance learning has no cons only pros and should be put in place as soon as possible.
