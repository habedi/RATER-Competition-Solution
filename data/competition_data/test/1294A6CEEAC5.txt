A wise men once said,"

That schools offer distance learning as a option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferesing.

First of all online schools will benefit all students. because,this way they won't have excuses to be tardy,they will also have more energy to complete their asignments. This way they will have more time for all of their subjects and no excuses because they had enouph time to gain energy to work on all of their subjects.

Second If students go to online schools their will be less trafic on the roads,People will be able to get on time to their jobs since they will be no buses causing traffic,online schools may be beneficial to all those who are always late to work and they will be less accidents.

Some my argue that online schools will not be beneficial because teachers,bus drivers and janators may loose their jobs online schools migth benefit students but it won't benefit schools staff's.

Finally although Students might benefit from online schools it may be better, If they still attend to regular schools so that way they will know how to sociolaize and interract with others. online schools should apply when they're snow days or problems with the weather so that way students will not get behind and always be caugth up in all of their subjects.
