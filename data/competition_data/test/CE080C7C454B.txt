The planet venus is kinda like a extra star in our soler system, in the article it says it's "sometimes called a Evening Star" and it also said that "venus is a planet" and it is the second planet from the sun it's a good pursuit.

The people of start to work on spacecraft so they can see what is out there and the first place they went to was the moon then mars and now venus in the article it says "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus" and the article also says that the challenging part is the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere so for the people that want to pursuit the planet venus it would be a good idea to look for information online or ask for information from any space programs that might be happening near you or if that doesn't help you ask people that work with stars planets and constlation at the planetarium.
