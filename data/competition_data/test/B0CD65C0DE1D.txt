I believed students could be beneficial with online classes because, many people are used to travel a lot to take a class on campus, but since there is a way to do classes. I think it's better for many people that travels from a far place to the college to study their career. For Example if a students travel for 2 hours to get to the campus or college that student would be taking a lot of time to his class on campus, Many students that are on campus are paying for apartment and books etc, But online there is a better way to finish classes for graduation.

However, many students are willing to make online classes because there is a lot of stress when they travel from their house to campus and many students are stock in traffic or if there is a accident many students are not making it to their classes although many students are willing to take online classes than on campus. my reason is since their is technology in this world on this days to take many thing online for example their job, online classes, or talking to professors that are on different part of the world now with technology there is a better way to study or finish classes for our good purpose. also their is a way to communicate with teacher via video conferencing and that another easy way to take classes other way to take classes and just with your teacher not having more students. when you are with the teacher you are able to ask questions and the teacher will answer the questions that you are asking and have knowledge of what the teacher is talking about on his class, Not like on campus that there is a class full on students and its harder to ask a question to the teacher or ask for his opinion on what the subject is, as you would be online where its more easy and online can learn more since you are with just the teacher.

As students we have many responsibilities on college when we are paying our classes we have to go and finish them, As online there is more time to be with your teacher and talk about what the class is. also many classes online are just an 1 and a half and online there is a power point for the students to see what going on on the subject and could be easier to know the class or the teacher can show the studnt how to do certain jobs that would help when tey start to get a job and not having to be desing with other stuffs to get the job that we are been studying for.

In conclution to my response many students are willing to pay classes online and not going to campus to study, but for many people they prefer go to campus and study and have more time stuying on library or in classes. my opinion is that online classes could benefial students who are working and studiying at the same time since taking classes online or at home since we have thsi technology have to uset for our own good an not wasted on other stuffs and here are the best ways to study online you can wake up and just open your computer and take your classes and then do a different class or go to your job or go into the campus to get the books that are needed to take the class.
