Do you know about the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you don't that's okay, because I'm going to talk about that today. Oh yeah, I'm Luke by the way, anyways let's get the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is amazing you get to go to all of these beautiful places. The whole point of it is too help take care of animals, people, and even help built their houses (In Europe for know). The reason for that is, because the World War II just got done in Europe and everything is ruined there and we can help them. That's why we have the Seagoing Cowboys program to help what has been ruined in countrys. This is a good experience to help and see knew things. We're traveling on sea (I hope know one is sea sick) and the cattle boats are unbelievble. While we are going to help people you get to go past China, Italy and more places. This is a very amazing opportunity and I hope you do the right thing and sign up.

In this program you can save peoples lives and make them happy. Also you can see some pretty amazing things, and you can learn new things. I really hope you join. Thanks for reading! Bye!
