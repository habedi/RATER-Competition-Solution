Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have always been told that being on a team can help you in many life skills that you need to know. So i am writing this letter because i don't think it's fair to some of the students that can't play sports and are suffering with their grades. I think there should be another way for the students to get their grades up and be able to play school sports at the same time.

Working on a team can help with teamwork skills that you can not learn by just doing projects with a group. Having the ability to work with a team has a big impact because you need to learn how to pull your own weight and not just stand back. If one student had a C so they couldn't play their favorite sport football, they wouldn't know how it felt to be part of a real team.

I think that playing sports also help you with being a good leader for the school. Every time you put on the jersey or uniform for your school you're representing it and showing how good of a school it is. If you could never have the possibility to do that you would never have the experience of being a leader for your school.

Lastly, I think that all students should learn how to have good sportsmanship towards other people and teams. What if you get a better grade on a test than someone and you rub it in their face? You would never know how the other person felt till someone did it to you. But if you were on a basketball team and you won you would know to go over to the other team and congratulate them on playing a good game. Or if you lost you would congratulate them on winning.

From the students perspective i don't think it's fair to take away sports from just having a C because i feel that being on a team is very helpful for later in life. I think that it would be unfair to take that away from students that are struggling in school. The only time that it would be necessary to take playing a sport away from a student was is he or she was failing a class.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
