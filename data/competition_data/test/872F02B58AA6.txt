Some people believe that summer projects, which are required by some schools, should be teacher-designed while others believe the summer projects should be student-designed. Teacher-designed summer projects would allow the students to learn more efficiently, as the content would be very similar to the content taught in school. Student-designed summer projects would allow the students to be creative in their learning, while also having fun. The summer projects should be student-designed, because students would be able to be creative in their learning, students would be able to have fun while learning, and students would be more motivated to complete the project if it is from their design, making it easier for them.

The summer projects should be student-designed, because students would be able to be creative in their learning.

When teachers design their own assignments such as, class work, homework, projects, etc., they are not designing work that is fit to work with every student's personal preference, style, and creativity. With this, the students are restricted from enjoying doing their work, and they are not able to do their work as efficiently. With student-designed summer projects, the students would be able to design a project that is fit for their personal preferences, and that differentiates with the rest of their peers. The students would be able to let their creativity flourish throughout the project, and the students would ultimately enjoy completing the project. Student-designed summer projects would allow students to show their true colors while also learning and having fun, which leads me to my next point.

The summer projects should be student designed, because students would be able to have fun while learning. When teachers design projects for their students, they are mostly professional with no creativity or differentiation. However, if students were allowed to design their own summer project, it is likely that the students would make the project fun in their own way, and as enjoyable as possible. StudentsÂ would be able to have fun showing their personality in their project, while also learning in an entertaining way, which would likely motivate them more to complete the project, leading me to my final point.

The summer projects should be student-designed, because students would be more motivated to complete the project if it is from their design, making it easier for them. When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, most students tend to procrastinate on it because they know how boring it is, since teachers tend to make projects strictly on the topic, or subject they are learning with no differentiation. However, if students were assigned a summer project that they can personally design, the students would likely be more motivated to complete the project. A student-designed summer project would allow the students to use their creativity and make their project fun and filled with their personality. This would ultimately motivate the students to complete the project because they know what it is about and they are able to maneuver it in their own way, making it enjoyable for them and their personal preferences.

Critics will argue that allowing the students to design their own summer projects would decrease the efficiency of their learning since the project is not designed by an educated professional. However, having the students design their own summer project and making them be creative in their own way by designing it, allows them to learn in their personalized way and determine how to learn efficiently while also fitting with their personal preferences. Although teacher-designed projects contain more efficient information, allowing the students to learn more efficiently, giving students access to design their own summer projects allows them to be creative and different from their peers, which ultimately allows them to show their true colors in a fun way while still learning. Students should be allowed to design their summer projects in order for them to be creative, have fun while learning, and to motivate them more to complete their personally designed project.
