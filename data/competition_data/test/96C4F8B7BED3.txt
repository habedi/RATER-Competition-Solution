The Creation of the Thing

"Hold on! Can we actually "calculate" emotions-- like math homework?" do you think that using a computer to deturmane our feelings is right? To me thats cool, maybe even unbelievable. Is the use of computers,emotions,and muscles the key to feelings.

Many people can't seem to find what feeling mona lisa is showing, sometimes you cant see what emotion your friend is having. Two professors have decided to invent a software which it can detect the feeling of a person or a painting. stated in paragraph 1, " the software is the lastest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate." This shows that the professors are trying to invent and new and improve way to figure out emotions within the human and paintings. They are creating a software for the computers. Also stated in paragraph 3, " The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscle." Not only can the computer detect the feelings, it also makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting.

Everyone has emotions but some you just cant tell how they are feeling, well now you might not have to worry about that i do believe that this software is going to be very valuable to the students, in very many ways. its going to help them with observing the way the looks and creses in the face is. Stated i paragraph 3, " Eckman has classified six basic emotions-- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness." There are many emotions but these are the most common. Also stated in paragrapgh 4, " In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emmotions." No matter what the person is feeling. if they feel sad, worried and happy all at once the software can still detect the emotions of this human or painting.

You know that it takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it takes why less muscles. just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling. when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7, " In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the coners of your mouth." with just useing a couple of muscles it can add a whole different facial expression. Like if you sqint your eyebrows and then also smile and also close your eyes a little bit I know that i wouldn't be able to tell weather they were happy or angry. just by changing on muscle movement it can change the facial expression. Also stated in paragraph 8, " But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius." not only is this cool but its differentuse one other different muscle and people can tell that your smile isnt really and happy smile.

This software is a great idea to help many people just understand the emotion of others with the knowledge of computers, emotions, and muscles they will be able to know how anyone is feeling just by the three main reasons.
