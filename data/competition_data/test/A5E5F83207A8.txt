Dear Principle ,

I think all students should be required to take community service. Reason being , I think students should have some type of experience in helping our community out. Not only the community but to help the planet out as well. It would help most students who are teens. Because it will most likely keep them out of trouble during there time helping out. It can help them stay on track in school, keep up their grades. And have extra credit. Also help keep them from being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also think it will be a nice experience for those who want to help out. It could also be a fun learning program by having the students learn about their environment and their surroundings. Having students do community service will be a great way of helping save some animal. Animals? You may think. Well yeah animals too. In their own special way. It would help keep all kinds of animals from putting things in their mouths, and help them by decreasing the death rate and health problems that are in the air. I strongly suggest this program. It would also be a nice was of making our school look nice. Not just from the outside but from the inside as well. There for I think you should have all students do some kind of community service to help out.

And it can help put more knowledge. Students doing community service might also have an impact on the younger kids by wanting to help keep the environment clean and safe for all people. I strongly recommend this program. I hope this may help change your mind. Thanks for your time and support in having to read my letter.

Sincerely,
