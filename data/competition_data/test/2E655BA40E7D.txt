To the Principal of our school:

I am in no support of your idea of having a policy for sports athletes to have a B average.

We have done a survey that shows a majority of our students here at school have a C average, and some of those people are athletes. This will not help our school in anyway! We have a great athletic program but this is going to ruin it. I understand that schools promote a challenging learning environment but if they don't understand a subject and get a D or a F, they can't help that, and that means they're off of their sports team.

Students in our school want to play sports but if they are not a smart or gifted student, then you're just going to say, " Well, too bad your grade point average is sub par and we just can not accept that so you can not be on the team." If that were me I would first tell my parents, which they would be outraged, then they would be mad at you and the school, and eventually it gets worse and I really don't think that you want to go through with that type of problem, because I know I wouldn't.

Now I understand that it's the schools responsibility to challenge students to make them better and let them have more options and a better future, but if you will not accept them to a sports team, then that may hurt them into getting into a higher level sports team or a certain scholarship for a college or a university. If you go through with this act of a required minimum grade point average of a B, then you can hurt some of these kids futures. That would leave a bad reputation on our school and you. For myself, I love sports and this will make me work harder to stay on a team, which I am assuming is your goal in all this.

As a student with concerns on this revising of a school policy, I have some suggestions for you as in regards to how you could make more students happier. My first suggestion is change this to a C average because as I stated before, most students have a C average and this could help them in regards to boost morale in the school, or boost their self-confidence, also this could let super star athletes go into a sport and bring in trophies for the school and also bring a better look to the school in regards to athletics recently.

As you can see I am strongly against your proposed plan for athletic minimum grade point averages to be a B, and I have told you why myself and numerous other students at our school are very strongly against your revisions to that policy. But I have also provided you with an alternate solution that can help you, the students, and the school itself. So I hope that you can look at this letter very carefully and can make the students happier at our school.

Sincerely,

Students at school
