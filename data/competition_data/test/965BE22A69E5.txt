DEAR MR. PRINCIPAL,

I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOUR IDEA OF CHILDREN UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS WITHOUT THE PROPER GRADES.

THIS RULE, OF COURSE WOULD NOT APPLY TO ME CONSIDERING I HAVE A 4.0 GPA.

BUT I ALSO PLAY THE WONDERFUL, CIVILIZED SPORT OF FOOTBALL [THAT IS THE AMERICAN SPORT, FOOTBALL, AND NOT THE STUPID WHOOSY THING ALSO KNOWN AS SOCCER].

AS A YOUNG STUDENT- ATHLETE I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE A SHOT AT

THE PRO'S IF WE GET RID OF HALF THE COMPETITION BY SETTING THIS RULE UP.

ALSO ISN'T IT LOGICAL THAT IF WE SET THE GRADE EXPECTATION HIGHER OUR SCHOOL WILL HAVE A BETTER TURNOUT OF GRADES.

BECAUSE MOST YOUNG KIDS WANT TO PLAY SPORTS THEY WILL MOST LIKELY BEHAVE BETTER, GET BETTER GRADES, AND TRY HARDER. THIS WILL ALSO, IN FUTURE LIFE,TEACH KIDS TO GO TO HIGHER GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS IN THEIR JOBS.

THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY OPINION INTO MIND.

SINCERELY,

STUDENT_NAME=]
