Dear senator,

I highly suggest you to reconsider about voting for that particular president. There might be quite a few people that voted for that person. Also there is a lot of people that like the other canidate. Most of the people that are not eligable to vote would want you to make the right choice.

Now that most states have a winner take all system it is not very fair for all the people in one state just to go to one person. It is the right thing to do to get all of the people in one state just to vote for the canidate that they want to take over the oval office. It would be a better system and would have less of a possible risk just to get a tie in the ellectoral college.

So i highly regard this letter just to let you know that changing the way of voting would make a big deal to all of the country. It would benefit the whole country that every person could make a big difference in the elections of modern society. In the future we will have what is called chaos in the voting polls. None of the voting will matter because the electors will get to decide who will be president.

Scincerely,

Dylan
