Dear principal TEACHER_NAME,

Community service, we think it's a drag. We don't like it, we hate sometimes smelling it, so why should we do it?

Well, that's what some student's are thinking in their prospective. But I fell as if it might just be a good call. I mean, we have a lot of academics in our school, we take out time to do other things, so why cant we do this? Their are so many black history people who has done some heroic and courageous things in our past history. So, why cant we show our consideration toward this agenda. Also, this could be a lesson well learned for some kids. At times we can act like we're older than we should. We tend to get in a lot of fights, arguments, and any other type altercation a lot. This will let them know that it takes a person to be a bigger man and treat others with the respect from others.

So, in my defence, take this into consideration and also heed because our bullying charts have gone ridiculous. We need a better system program, more authority, a better society, a better future, a better education, and you really will see that this experience with community service will make a better future for the children of our time.

Sinceraly,

STUDENT_NAME
