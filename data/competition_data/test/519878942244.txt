The summer projects should be student designed because it can give more freedom and creativity for what the projects could be and how they can be done. If the project were to be designed by a teacher, then the student may have more of a difficult time doing it and struggle with motivation for it. For example: I myself struggle with motivation, and if I were to be given a summer project that was designed by a teacher, it may make me want to do it less and can also create a more difficult challenge because I won't know how exactly they may want to see it done. I have also seen other students complain when a teacher gave them a summer project and they weren't allowed to choose what they can do it on. Not only that, but the other issue (as it was mentioned a few sentences ago) was also doing it only how the teacher wanted it and the students complained that they wanted to do something more creative and if they were given allowed to, they'd pick something that interested them more and it would've looked much better than what they were limited to.

Generally things like projects, especially summer ones, should allow the students to design them. Because that much freedom may allow the student to grow up with more creativity inside them. While it being teacher designed, the real creativity/freedom goes away, or at least that what it may end up feeling like. Overall, especially over the summer, students should be allowed to have more fun with things like that. And giving them that libirty ends up taking less of that summer fun and relaxation away. The prompts should still be checked by the teacher to see if what the student has chosen is school appropriate, but other than that, students should indeed be allowed to design said summer projects.Â
