A spacecraft was circling around Mars. It was snapping photos of the planet when something was spotted. It looked like a human face. The only thing though it wasn't a face, it was a natural land formation. It is a priority for NASA to tell everyone that its just a landform.

The formation only looks like a face because the rock formation resembles the shape of a head. Shadows form the illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998 Mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael malin and his mars orbitercamera team snapped a pictuire.

The team snapped a picture ten times larger than the original Viking photos, as said in paragraph seven of " Unmasking the Face on Mars". Thousands of anxious "fans" were waiting when they saw the image. It revealed a natural landform. There is no alien monument after all. You see the "face" is just a big rock.

Even though everyone is not satisfied and say that the experts are just hiding it from them, NASA is right. Why would we hide it from you? Everyone has the right to know about it. Plus that would be a lot to handle. I'm positive that we are telling you everything we know.

In conclusion we have told you everything. We have taken more pictures than anyone could ask for. The pictures prove that its just a rock formation. Some one even said, " It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River of

Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars." See it reminds some one of a landformation because it is.
