Have you ever thought about what life would be like without cars? I bet you're thinking about all the cons but see no pros. Did you know that "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"? Imagine how low those percentages would be if we stoped using cars. For the past years there has been efforts to try and make citites denser and better for walking. This would not only be good for our environment and ecosystem but also for ourselves. We could use the fresh air and excercise.

"In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting "Car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public tranport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year." "In pervious bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport." In Paris, after an intense near-record of polution, they enforced a partial driving ban to try and clear the air of bad gasses. After a few days of doing so, they noticed that car traffic had lowered 60 percent after several days of intensifying smog. In BOGOTA, Colombia, they they created a program that's set to spread to other countries in hope for them to do the same and had a car-free day. Millions of Colombians participated and did everything possible to avoid traffic jams and leave the street empty. Their goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. "It's a good apportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." All of these are many great advantages that are caused by limiting car usage.       Â
