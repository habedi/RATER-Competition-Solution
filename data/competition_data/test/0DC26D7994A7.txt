Dear Principle,

You should not change the grade average for students to participate in sports form a C average to a B average. For example, if a student is trying his/her hardest the should not be punished for not getting a subject. Also if a C average is considered passing the class then are you going to change average to pass to passing to a B also. That to me tell student you are doing well or good in school but you not doing so good to play sports. Now if the student had D average and they needed a C average they should not be able to play sports they have not put it all in to there grades. A B average is saying that I am trying hard to get good grades. So why would you punish a child who has a good over all grade and keep them from playing sports. In all there class they might have all A and might have one C which would take there grade average to a B. but what if this child go all A and might have gotten a C in one class and a B in another that would take there Grade average even lower so the don't get a subject or they do bad on some test. should you let something so small as not under standing something in class stop them from playing sports. we are all humans you cant tell me you understood everything you learned in school. Why should something as small as that keep them from playing the sport they love.
