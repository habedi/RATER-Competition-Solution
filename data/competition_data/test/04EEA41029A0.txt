There are a variety of reasons why people should be able to use their cellphones while driving. One reason situation in which drivers would need to use a cellphone is for driving directions. Another reason to use a cellphone while driving would be for an emergency situation, then last would be to report a hazardous road condition.

Nowadays people are using the new and upcoming driving apps Lyft and Uber. For a driver to know where to pick up and drop off a person who needs a ride. People also love to visit new places and state attractions. For tourists they often uses google maps or cellphone GPS. It's never a good thing to have the phone in your hand or in your cup holder while driving so that's why companies have made phone holders that are placed on the windshield of the car so that you can always keep your eyes on the road while driving to your next destination.

Another reason for use for cellphones while on the road would be for emergencies. Most people have family out of state and many parents worry about their children who attend college out of state and would love to hear from them at any chance they get. Let's take a newlywed couple for example. The husband is on his way to work while his pregnant wife is home resting next thing she knows her water breaks and is on her way to the hospital. When she reaches the hospital she calls him immediately and now he is on route to the hospital.

Lastly most cellphones are used to contact state or highway patrol to alert them about highway safety related non emergencies. Like if there was a highway/road block or a really bad traffic jam. Most of the time they call highway patrol for vehicle breakdowns/problems, accidents, hazardous material spills, or other highway hazards/problems, as well as impaired or aggressive/reckless drivers and other criminal behavior.

So having a cellphone at your fingertips isn't so bad. Talking on your cellphone while you drive can certainly lead to distraction and accidents but having a cellphone in your car can be very useful in an emergency situation. So the next time you talk on the phone be careful on how you go about it.
