Have you ever felt the need to communicate with a computer

Personally I think it is valuable to have "The Facial Action Coding System,"in our computers in classrooms.

although many may disagree but we all have our own opinions. The reason being for my opinion is that if a computer in a classroom can tell if im sad it'll probably change my mood by the time I leave that class. Like the passage said if the computers in the classroom can tell if your sad it'll give u a different ad from the one youll get if your happy or smiling. Also , lets say a student is sitting at the computer bored maybe the ad that pops up may change that for them. Many students now a days dont do their work or what their supposed to do because of boredom. I think having computers understand a persons emotions, mood, facial expressions and etc. is pretty cool. You dont know what goes on out of school, to cause that persons emotions. If a person and computer can comunicate I feel like itll help out in so many ways. Especially, for the shy ones or the ones who are always upset. People like that dont want to talk to anyone or explaine how they feel and holding everything in just effcts , both physically and mentally.
