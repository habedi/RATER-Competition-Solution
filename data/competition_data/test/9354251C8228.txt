The challenge of exploring venus is is that the atmospheric pressure is over 90 time greater then what we have here then what we ever will have here on earth. The normal temperatures on venus is about 800. The most we every get here is about some where in the 100s if you go to venus you will cook like your diner would. And there is way to much mercury on the plant. The plant havs a rocky surface. It has valleys and mountanins. It is kinda like earth.

NASA has an idea thst they want to send people up to go and study the plant but not put then not the plant cause you can't land on it. They want them to fly above it and study it. And see what they can learn about it and see about it. But still being that far away from the plant it would be 170. The air pressurse would be sea level on earth. They would be hovering about 30 miles above it. It would not be easy for them them but it still be survivable for humans.

NASA is working on a study on Venus with a diffrent approaches. One example is the silicon carbide that have been test in chambers. The have looked back at old technology. One called mechanical computers they where frist made in the 1800s. But they frist played a role in the 1940s.

They are looking for stuff that will give them more power. Modern computer are more powerful, flexible and quick. They need it to suroivoiur the heat of Venus. because it is not use to that much heat.
