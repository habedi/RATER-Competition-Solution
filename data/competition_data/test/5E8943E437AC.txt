NEW GRADE POLICY?

Hello and how are? First of all I would like to thank you for the time you are about to give, I do know you are very busy so I will try to be brief. I have recently been notified of the change in sports to grade policy. I think that, that is a bad idea. Many of the sports players have a C average so with the grade policy they can not play and we would no longer have as many sports teams as we do. I do know that grades should come first but what If instead of having a B average to play we make after school study groups which is mandatory for all of the sports players, and we can let some of the strait A students touter them. This way we are not only letting more people play but we would increase as a community.

We also should not follow that rule because as I said before a lot of kids would not be able to play. Some of the kids who wouldn't be able to play would lose there fun time. A lot of kids use sports to have fun and get away from there everyday stress. With taking that away kids may be discouraged and stop trying all together. I am also a sports player so I know how these people feel.

So as I stated before we should keep the grade C policy and make study groups to help people get there grades up. Doing this we would be helping many people and encouraging many people to bring up there grades. I encourage you to take these points into consideration and if you can change the policy back to a C average so everyone can continue to play the sports that they do. Thank you again for your time.

Sincerely, a concerned student
