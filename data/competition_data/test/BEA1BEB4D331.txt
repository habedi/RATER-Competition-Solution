Dear Principal,

I understand that you want to raise the policy for grades to participate in sports or other activities. Right now the policy is a C average and you want to make it a B average. Well personally I think it should stay a C average. For me it doesn't make a difference because my grades are higher. But I know that some people struggle to get C average and sometimes that is the best they can do because thing are going on at home. Some kids who would usually be D students try hard to get a C average so they can participate in school activities. If you raised it to a B average for some of the kids that would just be too far out of reach and they would fall back to a lower grade because they don't have anything to strive for. In the grading system a C is the average grade and a B and an A are better than average. So if a C is average wouldn't you want average kids to be able to participate in school activities. Other people may say that a C average is too easy on kids, my response is so you know every single kid that has a C average and know exactly what they might be going through. There are more reasons why to keep the school policy a C average but I believe these are a few of the important ones. I hope this letter helps you decide the right choice.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
