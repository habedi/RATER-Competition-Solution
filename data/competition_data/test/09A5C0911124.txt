The principal decided to put everyone in an extracurricular class and the students disagree with this decision, if we take extracurricular activities they will be energy, wasting time, and a waste of money.

Extracurricular activities are a waste of time, instead of being at a meeting for student council we could be home enjoying are families and friends while we can. These activities will just make it harder for us to wake up stable and functional for a new day at school especially sports. No one wants to stay three hours after school for a meeting with some other kids then have our parents pick us up. Those teachers/coaches also need to go home on time to get home to spend time with their families so keeping them here for extra hours is not the best idea.

These activities wont be cheap, the equipment for football, soccarball,baseball,basketball wont be cheap they will cost a lot of money. Football equipment will at leastÂ coat 10,000$ because of the gear that is bought every season and the 100 yard field that needs to be cleaned every month. Basketball equipment will probably cost the same because of the jerseys bought every season and the basketball court that is polished every week. Soccarball will not cost as much as football, because the only thing the school is buying is the jerseys and gear, they already have the football field to play on.

By the time we get home from these extracurricular activities we will be completely sore or completely tired and we need a good nights sleep to function, so why make us lose our good nights sleep just for an activity, We need to be able to wake up in the morning and say "ahhhh another day" and smile instead of " dang it man school sucks" and get mad. These activities will completely blow us out, make us not want to come to school, and deplete the energy right out of us. We need to come to school with a good attitude and good vibes not tired grouchy/grumpy, in conclusion the idea of the activities is good but the outcome is not, when we wake up the next day from the activity we will not be able to function at all, the school will just be wasting money ont these activities, and wasting other peoples time.
