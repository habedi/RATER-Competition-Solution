How would you feel if you had to join an extracurricular activity? If I were in that situation, I would be thrilled. Making students to participate in extracurricular activities is great idea because it's a way for them to meet new people, learn important skills, and get involved with their school.

Firstly, it's a great way for students to meet new people. Not only would they have the chance to meet new people, they could even make new friends! I have met many of my closest friends through sports; friendships that I probably wouldn't even have, had it not been for these extracurricular activities. It would be especially helpful to students who don't have very many friends or to students who are shy. It may even help them break out of their shells.

Secondly, these extracurricular activities would help students learn important skills. For example, playing sports. You aren't going to win every game, and that's okay. However, learning how to have a good attitude, win or lose is an important skill to have. Another skill that could be learned in these activities is learning how to work with people, even if you don't particularly get along with them. Both of these things are skills that you will use throughout your life.

Lastly, having students participate in an extracurricular activity is a way for them to get involved with school. Students who serve on student council have a place to share their opinions and bring attention to particular issues in their school. By doing this, they are making the school a better place. Not only are they making the school a better place for the kids, but they are also making the school a better place for the teachers and staff. These activities might even encourage students to work harder or put more effort into other things, such as their schoolwork.

In conclusion, I believe that having students participate in extracurricular activities is a wonderful idea. It gives students a way to meet new people, learn important skills, and get involved in school. And why would we waste an opportunity to help our students and teach them new things? The principal should most definitely make participating in extracurricular activities a new rule, and students should be open to trying new things.
