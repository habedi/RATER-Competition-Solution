One topic that is frequently debated is whether or not students should attend to classes from home by way of online. Some people think that students would not learn as good as they want them to learn by taking classes at home online. They feel that the teachers have to be teaching, explaining, and responding questions person-to-person to understand even faster. I believe that students would actually focus even more by taking classes at home because most of the them have jobs, expensives, and family to support.

One reason why attending classes from home online is it important is because students have another life besides school. Students would barely spend time at home. Students have to make their own choices, their own things, and their own path in order to have a successfully future. The majority of the students work a bunch of hours and get off from work very late. They would not like to wake up early to go to school the next day.

Another reason why is because students need to pay their expensives. They have the necessity to buy things as well, to pay their bills, food, and rent. Students would neither be able to achieve their goals, nor have a pacefull life without any struggle if they don't pay their expensives. In order to have a life out of debts, they must work for their necessities.

The final reason why is because some students have their families back in their countries. They support them and they also give them an economic aid. The more money they make, the better it is because not only their parents help them, but them. We are a diversity of students and each one of us have different reasons, purposes, and persuits.

As you read, everyone think differently and have different reasons. Only when we know our responsabilities, our effort, and our situation; we will realize that some of us need an opportunity to succeed on our own way. Our families will be proud of us. On that day our society will become good and the world will be a better place to live.
