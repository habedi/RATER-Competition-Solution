Throughout time, students from all over the world have been waking up early to attend school in order to achieve an education. With the new technology we now convey, students may not have to do that anymore. Schools across the country are now looking into offering classes online, or via video conference. Although some may say students would benefit greatly by no longer feeling obligated to attend classes at school but rather having them attend digitally, I believe that by physically attending to school you are not only being provided with superior education skills, but important life skills as well.

Most students of this decade have been known to challenge themselves by taking very complex and difficult courses. One advantage to taking these courses in person rather than online is that you are provided with multiple resources to ensure your success. For instance, at Generic_School, in Generic_City, students are given 45 minutes each day in which they call "Cougar Time", this period was designed so that students can travel to any one of their classes they wish to go to. This 45 minute period is a great educational resource especially for students who seem to be struggling in one of their classes and need the extra one on one help from a teacher. During Cougar Time, students are also provided with "The Center". The Center is located in the middle most part of Generic_School and is designed to provide one on one tutoring from fellow students. This option not only sets you up for success academically, but socially as well by allowing yourself to create new bonds with fellow students you may have not known before your tutoring session. Yes, by taking courses online you can also achieve one on one time with your teacher via video conference, but by attending classes in school you are not only supplied with that, but a whole period 45 minutes a day dedicated to help grant all your educational needs. By attending school in person you are providing yourself with helpful educational resources that no online class or course could ever offer.

Social skills is by far the most important life skill one can obtain. From job interviews, to making friends, social skills is an everyday necessity you will inevitably need. Lucky for you, by attending school in person, you are presented with multiple opportunities daily designed help expand your set of basic social skills. For example, by even just raising your hand in class in order to ask your teacher a question, you are developing a set of social skills that will help you later on in life when you need to ask for assistance from your superior, or boss, in the work force. Another way you are benefited from taking classes at school is by enhancing your public speaking skills. In school, you will often be assigned many projects throughout the year that will require you to face your class and give a presentation. By having these presentations required, you are benefiting yourself and your future in a variety of ways. For instance, after having participated in many school projects that require a presentation, you will eventually watch yourself grow to speak more confidently and fluidly in front of a group of people throughout time. Although you may also grow some speaking skills by reaching out to a tutor for help with your online classes, you inevitably will always grow more by inserting yourself into a social setting through attending classes at school.

Without a doubt, by attending your classes at a school rather then digitally, you are not only allowing yourself to be granted with much needed academic services, but also allowing yourself to grow much needed life skills as well. In conclusion, students who decide to attend classes from home by way of online or video conference, are depriving themselves of skills and opportunities that will end in them succeeding both academically and socially throughout life.
