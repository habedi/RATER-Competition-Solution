Should the principle force people to do extracurricular activities like sport, work on the yearbook or serve in the student council?

I do not agree with this because the student shouldn't be force to do stuff is fine if the students wants to do then but they shouldn be force to do then.

For example the principle is forcing people to do sport but there is a kid that can do sport because they have problem of walking he shouldn be force to do sport because he can do the sport because he's leg are in some condition.

The activity are helpful for students, that by doing this activities they can learn more stuff that can be helpful for the future but shouldn't be force to do then.

What if the student is force to work on the yearbook but he mes up on a yearbook of someone and that someone complains to the office, the fault of messing up the yearbook is that person who created the yearbook. and that person that mes up the yearbook is getting in trouble for messing the yearbook.

So the conclusion for this is that they shoudn be force to do this kind of things like sport, work on the yearbook or serve in the student council.
