All around the world car use is declining and we are witnessing different approaches that reduce pollution and reliance on cars. In Vauban, Germany, an experimental suburb does not allow any cars and is compact so that transportation can be by foot or bike. In Paris, a number of days banned the use of cars for a large part of the population due to the amount of pollution and smog. In Bogota Columbia, one day a year is reserved as car-free day in which all cars are prohibited. Many other cities are joining in this "Holiday". Obviously the over-use of cars in todays society and the pollution it causes in large cities is a problem. These societies are taking steps toward making the areas better places to live.

The car-free community experiment of Vauban Germany was completed in 2006 and is home to 5,500 people. Many of the residents in the community including Heidrun Walter feel "...much happier this way". In my opinion a car-free community in which I can walk to any friends house or store sounds exciting and enjoyable. Also, the amount of pollution it would decrease would be outstanding. Many communities are noticing this trend and are interested in how it is catching on.

In Paris, France a ban of cars with certain license plates was enforced to clear the air of the city. The ban was enforced after near-record breaking pollution. The smog created an unhealthy atmosphere full of congestion. After nearly a week, the smog cleared enough that the ban was rescinded.

A car-free day is taking hold in Colombia, started by Bogota, in which one day a year all car-use is prohibited. The citizens are often excited to participate and for the last three years the turnout has grown. This participation helps the pollution in the society and influences other communities to do the same. All of these societies are taking different approaches to reducing car-use but they are all working. Hopefully limiting car usage will continue to grow throughout the world.        Â
