Dear Principal,

I believe that you should consider a policy allowing students to bring their phones to school. They should be able to use them during free periods but no other time during school hours. I believe that even if you did not allow phones at school, that the students would bring them anyway. People with phones believe that they are a way of communication. They can talk, video chat, or text to one another. Just because there is a policy of not having phones doesn't mean they will listen. They may still bring them and have more of a chance to get into trouble, but if you actually let them use their phones, then i believe, phones would not be such a problem. If they are using their phones during free periods, they would spend more time on their phones than getting into other troubles. Students may also use phones for projects and studying during free periods. They may have a big test coming and use the internet on their phones to get research. With a phone, they won't be walking back and forth across the halls to get to a computer lab. So, in conclusion, phones would make for less problems in the halls, help them study for tests and projects, and communicate to each other or people from other places. Phones must be necessary to some students or they wouldn't be carrying them around all the time. It would reduce the use of computers in the lab and the use of the school phone. It would cost the school less if there would be a policy of phones. It would also give the students responsibility to keep up with there phones and to not get them taken away. With that said, I hope you take this letter into consideration and think about it.

Sincerely, Student
