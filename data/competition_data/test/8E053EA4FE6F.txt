Should schools offer distance learning? I think yes because first of all the counties would be saving numerous amounts of money. One we wouldn't need to worry about buses no more, transportation it self is probably very expensive. We as students wouldn't have to get up so early no more we could chose what time we start learning. Also students wouldn't have to worry about disgusting school lunches the county would be saving more money, because students would be at home making their own food at the comfort of their own house. They also wouldn't have to worry about bad friends no more.

If schools were using video conferencing it would be so much easier for students to get ready for school. Students would just have to brush their teeth and then they would sign in to their video conference website and they would just call their teacher. Also their would be less distractions it would just be one on one, teacher and student no classmates distracting each other. It would be more easier for students to learn also because the teacher could focus on the student, then the student would focus on teacher and get all of their assignments done, students will learn better if its one on one. It would also be much safer with all these school shootings happening in today's society.

Another thing students wouldn't have to be stressing about food getting them sick no more. Because the school lunches are just nasty and terrible. Students will be more comfortable at their home eating their food instead of the counties food. Think about all the money we could save with the website they could make. No one has to spend no more lunch money, on cheap food that will make your stomach hurt for a week straight.

Also we could stop bullying by starting this program up. Students wouldn't be able to get picked on no more because it would be a one on one conversation. Parents would not have to worry about bad influences on their child because they're child would be safe at home not with bad people at school. They wouldn't be around any other kids unless they go outside. Students will be more ready for the real world if we start this program.

If we start this program the county will be saving thousands of dollars and we could be spending that money we need in the world. If we start it students could chose a time in their day to start learning for at least four hours they would log in and say hello to their teachers through a screen. They would have to wake up at six o'clock in the morning then brush their teeth, then go pick a outfit they would like to wear in school. Instead of all that stress they could just wake up brush their, then make breakfast and if they wanted to start class now they could. This a terrific idea if the county starts a program like that.
