"Get up and try something new," someone once said. Imagine if the local school had fun activities after school that got students minds off of all the stress in their lives. I agree with this statement because extra circulars can introduce new friendships and create fun while exploring hobbies.

After school programs can provide new friends. Many people that join a club or school sport are just trying something that they haven't before and need some encouragement from a peer or someone to talk to. When I joined the school play last year it was a requirement to tryout. I was very nervous, but with the help of the rest of the cast I sang in front of a whole crowd and was cast a role. Sometimes there are students who are in the classes of others and may never talk to them, extra circulars are the perfect time to ask them questions and make them feel comfortable. In my History class there was a girl named Generic_Name, she was very shy but also very sweet. We rarely talked until we both joined the Best Buddies program and were partners for everything, we became very good friends and still talk to this day. Lastly, there is a chance to meet someone with similar interests as others. My mother met her best friend from the school basketball team when she was in junior high, they both loved basketball and continued to play together throughout high school. Extra curricular activities can bring together so many people and create new friendships.

After school programs can bring so much excitement and joy into students lives by trying new hobbies. Extra circulars come in many forms such as; plays, art, sports, or even technology clubs. By joining a sports team the coaches provide fun activities while still exercising, and in a club like the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) the leaders teach life lessons and helpful skills. I am a NJHS leader and our goal is to plan meetings after school that others enjoy while being informed as well. In these programs there may be a hobby that people never knew they liked. My friend went to the field hockey interest meeting and learned all about the sport from real players, she had so much fun that she tried out for the high school team and made Varsity! The activities are also beneficial to more than one group of students. Some kids with disabilities stay after school waiting for a ride home from their parents, as a result programs were created for scholars to stay with them and help do entertaining projects. At many schools they have the "iCan Bike" club, a club also for kids with disabilities to learn how to ride a bike without training wheels, using help from student volunteers the club fund raises money for the Special Olympics. Extra curricular activities make trying new things fun and helpful.

In conclusion, I agree that students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These programs can help others meet new people that are similar to them and create enjoyment with taking part in new hobbies that will provide happiness.
