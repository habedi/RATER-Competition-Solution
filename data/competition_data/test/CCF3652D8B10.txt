Do you think that reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I think that it can be a good idea if used properly because if the system can detect how someone is feeling it can adept to the person emotions and make it more intresting or entertaining for the student. This is good because this will help students stay on task with whatever their doingin class. But the only problem i could see with this is some students probably would not want system knwoing how they feel. This could bother the student even more or maybe the system would not even have an effect on certain student's emotions.

But i belieave it would be good to have something like this for exmaple the passage say's "For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. I thinks is a good exaple because he say's if the student is happy of what he is being shown the computer would continue to do similar things to keep the student going. Also if the computer detect's if the student's makes a frown it would continue to change and adept to the student intill he or she shows signs of change or entertainment.

Another supporting detail is that the computer can also recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored. I think this is really important because not all students would learn at the same paste. An if the computer can dectect this and help the student this is really helpful because some students or shy or don't know how to ask for help when confused on something. Having the computer detect when a student is bored is good becuase it could change the way infromations is being brought up and make it more useful and entertaining for student's. This would help them remain on task as well as help them learn even more.

My last reason why i belieave this would be a good choose is the way it can change the students mood. Imagine if a student all day was feeling sad/mad about something during school then they go on the computer and it changes its way of teaching to appeal to the student. This is really good because if that makes the student happier they would most likey but more in the mood for school. An example form the text is that "(Putting on a happy face"actually works!) A reowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy(feeling someone else's emotional sate) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

So in conclusion i do belieave that having a system that can read student's emotions is a good idea. I Belieave this because the way it can change so quickly to help a student. As well as it can determine if a reader is bored or if he/she is enterained .Overall i think it would help student's improve as well as stay on task. But this is what i belieave do you think that reading the emotional expressions of a student is a good idea?
