The value for this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a bad idea. Because then we would be in there faces every day trying toget them to feel better and what if they don't want help.

An example i could use is the fact that what if they have a blank expression and the technology doen't work. Then what would happen if they're anrgy with you because you don't leave them alone. Also we don't need this technology to tell what is wrong with our friends, like whats it says in paragraph 5 it says "you can probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the looking his or her face". And another thing we do not need the software to get in people faces with. Iust cause Dr. Huang can tell your facial expression by a certain way we smile doesn't mean his soft ware will always be right.

In conclusion I think this software is not a great idea to do any thing for the human enviorment. Because we are just fine without this software update.
