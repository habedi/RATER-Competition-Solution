phones in school

I think that we should have phones on schools because we can update our parents what we are doing in class and the phones can help us in class like use it for a calculator. But if a emergency happens during school we can tell our parents to pick us up or tell them what is happing in school, But phones can be distracting too some examples are if your friends texts you that can distract you from your school work Another example is you can play games on the phone when your not supposed too and listen to music. Some schools don't want cells phones cause they think it is really distracting and they could be texting other kids in other class. But the most important reason is they can use the phone for cheating on a very important test and teachers don't want that. that's why they don't want cell phones in school. That are some of my reasons that phones should be aloud in schools and some other reason that phones shouldn't be aloud in schools but my answer is yes phones should be aloud in schools.
