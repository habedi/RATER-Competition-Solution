Dear Principal,

I think there should be a rewards program for better grades. Something like the A B honor roll, but bigger. If you make the class with a passing grade you should be rewarded, with a chance to win something or a reward that you'll enjoy. You can always have money rewards or dance rewards or if you get straight A's you'll be in the school paper. Something big but not too big just to encourage students to try a little bit harder. If it doesn't work, try to make the prize or reward a little more wanted. Maybe randomly give off a electronic device, like an iPod or a laptop to one lucky person every semester. This will make people try more and more to get better grades.

If it doesn't work, try to contact their parents and let them convince their kids that they wont get anywhere without an education. Make more tutoring sessions. And tell the teacher to help ones who need it.
