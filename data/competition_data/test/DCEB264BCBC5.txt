In "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" Luke joined the program because his friend Don Reist asked him if he wanted to come with.

He knew it would be a once in a lifetime opprotunity, and because he would go to different countries.

In paragraph two it said,"World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins."

To help these countries recover 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA to give them food supplies, animals , and more.

The "Seagoing Cowboys" were hired to take care of the animals onboard the ship as they were shipped overseas.

They also had to clean the animals stalls and give them food and water.

Luke liked doing it so much that he did it many more times.

He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II.

When they were coming back they played games in th eempty stalls to pass the time.

In conclusion,

I believe that you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" to help the people can be affected by any wars or other things.
