The arthor has this great idea of exporing Venus in the future because as of now our technology can't sand the presure of Venus's atmosphere pressure. His idea, is to expore Venus since it was probably once very simaler to Earth.

Yet " Each previous mission ws umanned, and for good reasons, since no spacecrft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this isse explains why not a single spaceship has It tuched down on Veanus in ore than tree decades." It far to risky as of now. You see we can't even get to the deepest parts of our oceans and they want to send a spacecraft to Venus. The conditions in Venus are nothing compared to anything we humans have experamented on earth. Even if we do get to the deepest part of our oceans that is still nothing compared to what Venus is like."These conditons are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and wouls liquefy many metals." Thats not even all of it the temperature is also noting we've seen before. "On the planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheroc pressure is 90 times greater than what we experiece on our own planet." It seems imposible to even try to going to Venus with everything that us haman need to live . There is to many facters that they'd need to look into the temperature and atmospheroc problame but also the weather on venus. Weather presents additional impediments like eruoting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking ao land on it's surface." There is to many facters that they'd need take into consideration before they move on with there plans and ideas.

NASA thinks they have a solution to be able to explore venus. "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Veanus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imgine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or s miles abovee the roilin Venusian landscape." At that distance the temperature would be arounf 170 degrees Fahrenheit and air pressure woud be close to sea level. Yet even there the condestions would be harsh for the scientists onborde. Inside the ship and out side. Plus scientists aso dont know all of the facters with going to Venus Since they haven't been able to gather samples of any rock, gas or anything else from our sister-planet. "Therefore scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to undersand

Venus would needto get up close and personal despite the risk."
