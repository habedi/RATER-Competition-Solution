We all know that not every student learns the same way as others. Also, there is not a teacher for each single student in the school. With the use of Facial Action Coding System students may find a more comfortable or more efficient way to learn or understant a class lesson.

The use of Facial Action Coding System in schools can help teachers know if their methods are effitient for their students or if a student feels confuse about what they are doing. In the text it says, "A classroom computer could reccognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." With this, we can see how it could become a lot easier for teachers to identify which parts of a topic are more confused for their students or how comfortable students feel about what they are trying to learn.

Some people may think that each student should be free to feel the way they want about school, but by knowing how the students are feeling can prevent problems about how they learn. Some students may have problems understanding that can lead them to lose care about school, but by recognizing this problems those students can recieve the right help or advices for their education.

Another reason why Facial Action Coding System should be used in school is because it may also recognize when a student does not feel happy about its own life. FACS can even recognize specific emotions and not just if someone is happy or sad. In the first paragraph it says, "She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." This is what FACS can identify about only a picture. Now, imagine how more extensive can be a analysis about a student who is constantly making different expressions. This can show if a student feels very angry or vey frustated and not necessarly about school. It maybe familiar problems, even personal problems.

Some people and even parents may argue that the use of FACS can make the students feel spied. And this can make the students try to hide their emotions, but it can also be detected by the FACS. The FACS is not ment to be use to spy the emotions of students. Its goal is to undertand how the student feels so he or she can recieve the right help.

Finally, the use of this new technology can be very helpfull because it does not only identifies the problem. It actually can do something to solve it. If a student feels confused, the computer may show easier examples of more context so the student can feel comfortable about what he or she is learning. Another advantage of its use is that it will keep helping the student until he or she feels comfortable with it. Also this can be recognized by the use of FACS.

Some people may by against the use of FACS in schools because how expensive it may be, but this could be and effitient and usedull tool for teachers and students that can improve the way people learn.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System should be used in schools because it can identify if students have problems uderstanding a topic, or personal problems, and it also will do something trying to solve it. For those three main reasons, FACS should be used in schools.
