Have you ever wondered what was on Mars. NASA did and in 1976 they got a very weird picture, it was a face. We know the face is a natural landform now, because we have landforms that look like the "face." Also they took pictures with a great amount of detail. The conspiracy theorists thought that it could have been made by aliens.

One way we know that they "face" was natural and not made by aliens was we have landforms like that on Earth. They said "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." This proves that the "face" was not made by aliens, because we have them here on Earth also.

Another reason that we know that it was not a "face" was, because Garvin said thet you can make things out very well even if it was small with the camara they took it with. What Garvin really said was "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." This also proves that it was not made by aliens, because the picture they took is very precise.

The "face" was not made by aliens, and we can tell this by looking at the mesas we have here on Earth. We can also tell that it is a landform by looking at the pictures that they took. They are only two reasons that they "face" was not made by an aliens.
