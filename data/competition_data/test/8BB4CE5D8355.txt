When assigned a summer project, students should receive the project from teachers. When students are assigned projects from their teachers, they are more likely to work and finish it, as it will be turned in for a grade. Furthermore, when students are not pushed to complete something, they often dont worry about turning it in on time. Having teacher assigned projects will prepare the students for future material, allow help to students when they are struggling, and force students to turn their papers in on time.

Often, students are assigned projects to help with upcoming material that they will be learning. Having a teacher that knows what material a student may be learning in the future can help to prepare them and give them more time to learn about something.

Students struggle more when they are not given enough time on a learning target, but when assigned a project in the summer that goes over the material in advance, it can help a student have a better understanding of the topic. Also, when a teacher assigns a project in the summer about upcoming material, It can lead to better leaning when the teacher actually has to teach the lesson or material. Therefore, when the student is then tested or quizzed on the topic after the lesson is taught, it will help to result in better grades because they were already given a preview of the material. Students learn better when they are not rushed through a topic, so when they are given the material through a summer project assigned by the teacher, it will result in better grades.

Teachers play a major role in students lives. When a student is struggling with a topic or something they are being taught, they automatically go to their teachers for help. Studies show that when students have one-on-one time with their teacher, it helps them to understand what they are learning. Therefore, when a student is assigned a project by a teacher, they can always count on them for help if they have questions or problems. When a student doesnt have the help they need from a teacher, they tend to just give up and not even try. This results in bad grades because they didn't have the help they needed when assigned something. When a student is confused about something, teachers are the first person they go to, so having a teacher assigned project is helpful when a student finds them self stuck.

Many students dont do well with turning papers in on time and completing their work. Having a teacher to put a deadline on a project will force the student to complete their work on time. When a student isn't given a due date, they procrastinate and dont feel the need to get any of their work done. Teachers need to be strict with their due dates and hopefully that will push the student to want to work harder and get their work turned in on time. In today's world, students arent pushed hard enough to turn something in on time, or they are given many extra days to turn something in. This results in the student's feeling like they can turn in late work all the time and still get a good grade. Teachers need to be more strict about due dates and not take late work. Student assigned projects will lead to nothing being completed on time or turned in. Therefore, teachers should assign projects that will force students to turn papers in on time.

Students should be required to complete summer assignments, but being assigned a project by a teacher will result in projects actually being done and turned in. Summer is for students to have fun and have a break, but they can't forget about school and the material that comes with it. That's where teachers need to come in and give the students a little brain refresh. This won't be done though if students were to assign projects to them self. Having teacher assigned project's will prepare the students for future material, allow help to students when they are struggling, and force students to turn their papers in on time.
