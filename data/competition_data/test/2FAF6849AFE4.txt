C Average

Many students at Poston love to play sports and do many other activities. Changing our policy about students having to have a C average to having to have a B average would be a horrible idea. We should keep it the same because C average is passing and if we change it many kids will not be able to participate.

Changing the policy to having to have a B average is bad because a C average is considered passing. Parents may complain to the school that their child is doing their best. Many kids struggle in classes and work so hard to get a C or better. Do you really want to punish them even though they are doing their best?

If our policy changes that means many students will not be able to participate. This may cause our school to win less championships. Will we have enough students to participate to even have a team? Other kids may be missing out on school activities because someone got a C which is passing.

We should not change the grade average to a B to be able to participate because a C is considered passing and we many not have many people participating. I feel if we change our policy that many students will be very upset. So keep the policy the same don't change it to a B average.
