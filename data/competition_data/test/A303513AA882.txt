Technology is extremely helpful in our everyday lives and is a great way to interact with people. We use it to gather information and learn, as well as overall communicating with people all over the world. But do we really need it to guide us on human emotion? Emotional technology could actually keep us from understanding people on our own, and could make us too dependent on electronics.

Do you have a friend or family member who always knows how you're feeling even if you're trying to hide it? Analyzing other people's emotions is a good way for people to understand eachother and to grow close with one another. But technology takes away our ability to do that on our own. The author of "Making Mona Lisa Smile" states, "In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face". This is clearly a way to show how humans minds naturally can do the same job as the Facial Action Coding System. If humans rely on computers and technology to tell us how we or other people are feeling, we don't need to figure it out on our own. And if we are always relying on technology and not using our own experiences and analytical skills, then we will eventually lose our abilities to understand others on our own. People in the modern day are already very dependent on technology, we can not let it tear down our social skills. Having an emotion generator can slowly tear at people's social skills and will make us less able to relate to people. Identifying other's feelings can give people a sense of closeness, understanding, and relation to that other person, and if we constantly rely on technology to do those things for us, it would seem as though we are losing connection from person to person, and are making it a connection from person to technology.

Some people believe that technology is keeping us from the simple things in life, and we are more engaged in our cell phones than engaging with people or nature or any of our surroundings. So in that particular case, would using technology to read people make us to connected with electronics, or would it allow us to further connect with people? The answer is fairly simple. Nobody knows you better than you know yourself, and that means that nobody knows people better than people themselves. We have been able to read people's faces and emotions since the beginning of time, and are still currently able to. No technology can read the psychology of humans as well as humans likely can. So why would we add the element of technology to interfere with person to person contact? It is important that people are able to associate with other people without depending on other resources, and including technology to help us would in the long run actually hinder us. A person had to understand humans enough to create this kind of technology, so instead of making everyone dependent on technology, why don't we allow people to understand humans more on their own?

In conclusion, although technology can be useful, technology determining emotions could effect our generation in a negative way. Humans were born being able to understand basic human emotion, and we should not take away that skill from others through relying on technology.
