All students should participate in activities at school to keep themselves happy and to prepare themselves for their future lives.

First, students should participate in activities because they will learn to be more responsible. Students will learn to bring the material they need in order to participate in the activity they are in. Furthermore, responsibility will help them a lot in life and it would make their lives easier, because if people are not responsible they end up being losing their homes, lose their money, and then they would have to live in the streets and start begging for other people to help them. People should learn responsibility to prepare themselves for any trouble.

Second, Students will learn skills they have never learned before such as, Cooking, Painting, Drawing, etc. Some students when they grow up they would want to take the skills they learned from their childhood and earn money from them. Some students become famous artists or famous chef because they learned those skills from their school days.

Third, Students will learn to be mature faster. For example, some students are there because they want to take the job in the near future, so they will have to take in seriously and they will not have time to play around, they will be focused on learning the skills more then playing around all the time. Some people might agree with this, and some might not, some people think that a lot of kids are only there for the fun of the class and they dont take the class seriously, but kids are kids some times they will be playing around and some times they would be serious about the class. Some kids might want the job in the future and some are only there for the fun of the fun of the class.

Fourth, students will make even more friends when participating in an activity at school. For example, PROPER_NAME doesn't have any friends, so he decides to join a club or activity he likes and there he starts telling people what he loves and why he joined that club or activity and in a few days when he keeps talking to the other kids they become friends right away simple as that. Making friends in a club or an activity is that that hard all you have to do is tell people what you love and what you don't love and some people might have the same things that you love and they might become your friends right away.

Fifth, students will enjoy doing what they love to do. One reason why kids don't participate in activities is because the activities dont have things that the kids like. It is important to let kids do what they love unless it is a good thing, dont always stop your kids from doing what they love, this might affect their life, some kids dont get a job when they grow up and start living in the streets and selling illegal stuff, so it is important to let kids do what they want to do.

Finally, Kids should participate in activities they love in order to keep to help themselves in their future lives and keep themselves happy and keep themselves away from trouble and protect their future families.
