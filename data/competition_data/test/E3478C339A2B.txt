What are your chances of having an undivided attention while taking your classes at home? Many students who take classes from their houses haven't found it very interesting. Students who take classes online or on video conference aren't get much of what the students that take classes in school. In this computer, i will argue that students who take classes at school have more advantage than the students who take their classes online. Students should take classes in school because they get help from their teachers.

Distance learning isn't good for students who have difficulties in a subject especially Math. Some areas in math isn't hard to understand, but some areas require constant practice and teaching for you to master it. Students who take classes inside the campus would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers for tutoring. It is easy to understand when you are seeing the teacher face to face. that way you can ask questions and tell him/her the area you do not understand and need extra help on. Students who take classes in school also have the opportunity to talk to their classmates about a task and they get the chance to work in groups that way you can get your work done faster. Some students cannot read very well and that can affect them if they are taking classes online.

Students who take online classes have a much greater disadvantage. Some students who are usually late for school would then advantage to come to school and ask the teacher what they've missed, but if you're late for your online class and miss a class there's no way to go back and take that class again. that means they just wasted their money for nothing. Some students do not have a computer/laptop at home because they cannot afford one. The students who take classes in school can go to the library and do their work. Not all online classes cover every part of the topic. Some online classes only covers the important parts of that topic and leave the rest. Online teachings are nothing compared to the what the school teaches you. The school teaches can make the topic fun to talk about.

Students who take classes at home are most likely to get distracted from their work. They can get distracted by a single text message/phone call from their friends or relatives. Some of them have baby siblings who tend to be crying all the time. Some people pay a lot of money to take theses classes online but with all these distractions around them they won't make them concentrate.

Some say taking online classes is better than being in the class itself, but they are wrong, because they are missing all the fun that goes on in the classroom. Taking your classes in school is more affordable than taking it online. In the future i hope that students would know the importance of coming to school and learning from the teachers instead of using technology.Â
