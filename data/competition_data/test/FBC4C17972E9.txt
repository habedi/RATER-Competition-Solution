Community Service

TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you are thinking about making community service a mandatory requirement. As you know many of our students already volunteer in our community, but many also don't. This is a shame. Community service should be mandatory for our school because, it will give students a sense of community, it will help put a good name out there for our school, and students will get a sense of how lucky they are.

Community will help give students a sense of community because it will give them the chance to work with people who are helping the community. They will learn more about what is wrong with our community and how to change it but also what is going right with our community. They will be able to say i helped that person in our community or I made that park nice by picking up trash. Students today do not have a strong enough sense of community they don't think or know enough about what goes on in this community. And you have the power to change that. Making community service part of school would help students understand what it means to be part of a community.

People always think of middle school kids in a negative light. They think we don't care about the community. If we volunteered as a school we could change that. People might say hey that school has good kids. They might be more inclined to come to school events or to give money to the school for new laptops or desks. People would see that we do care hey and maybe some people who don't volunteer might say if kids can do it so can I. People need to see that kids care to and that we will do something. If people got the chance to see what a good school they are then maybe they would give us grants or participate in school concerts and activities. Volunteering will help people see what a great school we go to.

Kids these days often forget how lucky they are to have the things that they have. Like a flat screen T.V., ipod, or a Wii. But if kids got to volunteer they would see that some people are not as fortunate. They would understand how lucky they are to have what they do. Maybe seeing this would make them want to give back more. If kids got a better sense of how lucky they are they would be able to mature faster and people would respect them more. If volunteering was part of school kids would get a better sense for how lucky they are.

To not make Volunteering mandatory in our school is not only making the kids loose out but you are also making the school loose out. Lets show people what a great school we are. the only things that can come from volunteering are good. If volunteering was part of school kids would, get a better sense of community, put a good name out there for our school, and get a better sense of how lucky they are. So what's to loose!

Sincerely

A Student
