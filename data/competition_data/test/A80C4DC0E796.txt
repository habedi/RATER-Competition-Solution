To the Principal:

Community service is a very fun and easy way to learn about volunteering and what job you want to have when you get older. Many kids in our school believe community service is a waste of time and that it s boring. Others feel differently. I believe that community service in our school should be required so that students can get a good work experience, do a good deed to the community, and learn while they are doing so.

In our community there are many jobs and places to go for volunteering. Hospitals, schools, pet shops, are all examples of places young adults, like ourselves can learn and have fun at the same time by volunteering. Taking part, and working hard to help your community is very important, and lets face it. When we are doing community service, the community is thanking us, at a young age, for helping out.

Making this mandatory at our school will give us a chance to have a work experience. We can learn what it feels like to have a job and get "payed" for it, with community service hours. We all know that no body wants to get a "summer job". But you know what? If you go to a summer camp regularly, why not try volunteering at one? You could finally be in charge and take an initiative to help little kids have safe experience, and have fun at the same time.

If community service is required during the school year, i don't think that to be a very good idea. I believe that requiring about one-hundred hours in the summer would be enough. Why? I believe that kids my age like to procrastinate, in which if you only give them a little bit of work, and a lot of time to do it, they will wait until the week before school starts to do their hours. Also, requiring it in the summer will give kids the will to do something instead of sit there and watch television while eating, and then finally going to sleep at the end of each day. Wouldn't you get tired of having the same routine every day for about 80 days? I would.

Another problem in our community, that is becoming very severe is obesity. Kids are sitting down doing nothing, while stuffing their faces with junk every day of the summer. With community service, this will encourage kids to hop off the couch and go do something whether its walking the dogs in the neighborhood or running a marathon for cancer. Requiring community service will allow kids to get up and do something with their lives.

Furthermore, I think that requiring this will help our generation greatly. It will prepare us for the real world and what's coming next. If we don't prepare ourselves, how will we know what to teach the next generation, after our own? Also, community service is just a downright good thing to do. You are helping your community in a way that you cant imagine. Its just another step towards the future.
