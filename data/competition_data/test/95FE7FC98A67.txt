The new technology called Facial Action Coding System should should be used in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of the students. Why? you make ask. I belive it will actually rise the students smartness and test scores. Also it would be the best for years to come! It will hepl the students more smart becasue in classroom there are kids that are to scared/embrassed to rise their hand and ask questions. So if the teacher see a student is confused and sees that kid is to sacred to rise their hand then he would rexplain what he was teaching. Then if the technology shows he or she isnt confused then he would move on. This will be so great years to come because kids wouldn´t be left behind and wouldn´t feel that they have to drop out. If they will see their selfs being something big in the futer. Then we will have more doctors and mostly likely to find new medinces for illness like cancer. We will get sincetes to help us live in this earth longer and maybe hopefully keep the earth clean. They would be smart enugh to find new ways to keep the earth clean. Not even just to help the eart but help kids prevent from doing things that will harm themselfs and others. For an exmaple if the teacher sees somoene is so mad they can try to help and talk and that could help a school shooting because sometimes all we need to someone to talk to. So in conclusen i belive the new technology called Facial Action Coding System should be in the classroom because it will help the earth and thw world but mot imporantly us humans.
