School Sell Phone Policy

Dear Ms. Principal,

I think that the students should be allowed to have cell phones in school because if they are walking home and something happens they will be able to call their parents but if they don't have a phone they cant call anybody.

In my opinion i the phones should be off and in their pockets or even i their lockers so that they are not distracted by them during class. I also think they should be able to use then during lunch and other free time but when its time for class again they should put them away and turn them off.

If you do not allow cell phones in school at all students are going to thinks that's wrong because if its not distracting to you or the class, off and away, then they should have the right to have them, in case of an emergency.
