I do agree with making students do one extracurricular active such as sports, clubs ,and teaching program it would make the school healthier, kinder,and smarter. The student body at my school isn't very healthy, smart, or kind. Most of the student body isn't very involved with the school and that needs to change. Having student do things such as sports, clubs, and teaching program would change the student body as a whole.

First, most students at

Generic_Name are in as much shape as a billboard, they arent very active. By making students sign up for a sport would change that, not only would it make the student body healthier, but also it would bond the school. Sports could even pay off in the end for students but also schools. The way sports can change a school are endless but you can't have a sport team with out students. By making students sigh up for sports you are not only grantee a sport team but also a healthier and kinder school.

Second, Sports aren't for everyone maybe students want to become smarter or kinder in their school and community. Students could do that by joining a club like the F.O.R club. Students could also help their school by joining S.C.A

both of these clubs are very active. They are active in both their community and their school. Having students join clubs would benefit the school in health but it would benefit the schools community. If students were to join clubs the schools would be a safer and better place for both students and staff.

Third, some are students that aren't very active in both sports and the community. Those students could join teaching program to help benefit students. Those students would also be benefiting the school too. These student would most likely want to be come teachers. This program would benefit them, other students and the school. It would benefit them because they are getting early teaching skills. It would help teachers by not having them teaching program student when they could be making lessons and by having smarter students. All around this program would make the school a smarter place.

Is making students join one extracurricular active a good idea? Yes it is both students and the school would benefit from this rule change. The schools sports teams, clubs, and teaching program would be booming. When you have people coming to your sport, club, or program you can do bigger and better things. All around the pros out weight the cons that is another great reason the make the rule change. The schools health, kindness, and smarts would be greater than ever.
