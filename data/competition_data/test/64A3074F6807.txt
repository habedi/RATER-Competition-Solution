"The Challenge of Exploring Venus", suggests that we study Venus despite the dangers. The article gives good examples such as oceans, familiar features, conditions of what it would be like, and how they are going to go about this journey.

Before the reasons of why we should keep studying, there is some stuff on Venus on why people say that they shouldn't keeping doing research. The conditions are more extreme than anything people have experianced before. Venus is also the hottest surface teamperature of any other planet in the solar system.

Even thought there are risks astronomers are surprised by the fact that Venus could've been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. Venus is the second planet from the sun it was probably covered with large amounts of ocean and could've supported various forms of life. It even has a surface of rocky sediments that includes familiar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

The articles talks about how the temperatures can be dangrously hot even at 30 plus miles above the surface. It states, "Solar poer would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earths levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." This is saying that it would be hard to adapt to the enviroment but it is possible. This might mean there would never be seasons. It would alsways feel like summer.

Another thing that is being looked at is old technology called mechanical computers. This was important during World War II. These devices can make calculations by using just gears and levers. There is not required electronics. Modern computers are too powerful and delicate when it comes to the physical conditions.

The article says that human curiosity will most likely lead us to equally intimidating endeavors to push them to do more tests and reserach. There are many people in this world that travel and would want to go beyond the limits. They shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts. For these reasons it is worthy to continue these studies despite the dangers.
