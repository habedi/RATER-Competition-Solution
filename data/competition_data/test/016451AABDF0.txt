I think that would be very stupid. Not all kids are that smart. Some more than others. There may be kids that gets C grade average. Not all kids are smart as the rest of the kids. Some kids may be smart and good at sports others are just good at sports. Some kids are just good at school and nothing else. If the would do this to our school there would be a lot of kids going to different schools just so they can play in sports.

like me, I am not the greatest student I am a C average kid. I am a very good football player and it would kill me not to be able to play the sport I love the most. Most of my friends are just like me and are better at sports then they are school. It would kill most of the kids in our grade. There would be a lot of high school drop outs. You would see an increase in the violence in the area because kids will have nothing to do. That means kids will be more likely to do something stupid.

This also might change grades. It could increase the numbers of As and Bs and then again maybe not. It could wreck the lives of some. kids will be more likely to drop out of school and go to jail. If there is nothing to keep kids active in life then they will grow obese and out of shape.
