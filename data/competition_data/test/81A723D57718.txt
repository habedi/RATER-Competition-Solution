I think that students should be able to bring cell phones to school as long as they not used during class. If there is an issue that comes up after school then how would students get a hold of there parents or anyone to let them know what is happening. Sometimes I am told to bring my phone to school everyday but I have to keep it turned off until after school. There are days that I need my phone to contact my mom or my older brother to let them where I am at, who I am with and what we are doing. If i would like to go to somewhere after school with my friends I have to call in with my mom or my brother to tell that I am at Jamba Juice with my friends.

I have a suggestion, each student gets three chances if they are using their cell phones in class and they get caught three times for it then they will have to give up there phones every morning to the office. Then everyday after school the students will get their phones back, this would go on for 2 weeks for each student whose been caught. to remember the students name and face they will have to fill out a sheet of paper filled out by their parent's signature and brought back to school the next day along with their phone. Students may also leave their phones at home but the form still stands.
