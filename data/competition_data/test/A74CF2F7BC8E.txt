Over the Summer, students tend to disregard and ignore all things academic. This causes students to forget vital information. This can result in a challenge for students when they return to school after break, because they are expected to remember and build off of previously learned information. In an effort to lessen the amount of information lost, Summer projects are put in place and assigned. The teachers in the school should be in control of creating these projects, and assigning them to students. Teachers have a better understanding of what information is most important to retain, as well as what will be expected of students during the following school year.

When a student forgets information over break, a teacher must spend valuable class time reteaching information students should already know. This makes it difficult for teachers to move on to new information, when students need to back-track to information from the previous year. Then teachers are faced with losing time to focus on new information, causing students to feel overwhelmed when needing to make up for lost time curriculum. Summer projects eliminate this problem, because students will not need a refresher course when they return to school. Having Summer assignments keeps information from fading.

In a students perspective, these projects may not seem ideal, and students may feel as though their break is being compromised by still having work to complete over a break. However what the students don't realize, is that continuing to grow their memory of a subject over the Summer can be greatly beneficial. Teachers should create these projects based on what is believed to be most useful, so students can continue to learn and practice certain information that needs to be retained. Some students may protest these assignments, however keeping information over break is vital. Even though teachers know what was important and what will soon be expected; students know their own individual struggles and where they need to strengthen themselves. However if it were up to students to decide what was assigned and completed, not much would be done. This is because students would rather relax and forget information rather than have to do work over their Summer break. This is a main reason it should be up to teachers what information, and how much, is assigned.

Although students know where they individually struggle, teachers know what information will be incorporated into the expectations of students for the next year. These projects should include information from the previous year, but also provide insight into what students will be learning when they return from break. Students can also brush up on their own problem areas to strengthen themselves, while focusing on what teachers have assigned them.

To conclude this argument, students forgetting information over Summer break is not unheard of. It is extremely common but it is a problem students and teachers everywhere face. Teachers making Summer projects helps eliminate some of the information that fades from students, but also keeps their memory fresh to be able to continue to apply the information. Studying and doing schoolwork over the Summer may seem bothersome and laborious to students, but the results will help students secure information, influencing their academic success positively. Teachers should have the ability to assign Summer projects, but should also consult with students on what they believe would be beneficial to include, involving what the majority of the students need extra help understanding. Summer assignments prevent the hassle of reteaching information, giving students more time to learn and understand new information after their break, in the new school year.
