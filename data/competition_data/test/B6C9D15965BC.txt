Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think all students should be required to perform community service. I think this because community service can help the community grow into a better place for everyone. If the students were to perform community service it would show that the school was a good learning environment. My reasons for thinking that this should be required are that it would clean up the community, and help children that need tutoring. Also, it would make people see the importance of community service.

First, this would help clean up the community. No one would like living in a community full of thrash everywhere, well that least i wouldn't. Keeping our community clean will show that we care for our environment. Having a nice community without garbage everywhere would be a good thing for our homes ,but also will help to reduce a bit of pollution. Cleaning up after ourselves is something we should do all the time.

Next, helping children with their learning is something important because they are the future of the past. Learning is a important factor in life, what you learn you use. You might think I'm not going to use any of this stuff but you do without knowing. These children might also need a lot of help with tough work in their schools. We should be willing to help them learn what they need to know.

Finally, we should understand the importance of doing community service. It helps the community become cleaner and not filled with thrash. Helps children with their learning , and school work. Community service also helps the community become a better place for everyone.
