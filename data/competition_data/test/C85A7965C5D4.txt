Life at Sea

In my point of view this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for anyone back in 1945. His friend made a huge part of him going into Seagoing Cowboys. Growing up said he had two jobs so that mae it perfect for it beacause he ahd the expirence of working hard. He also helping his Aunt Kate's farm helped him get used to working hard for something. Luke and his friend Don was planing on doing this together. Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat, before he probaly wouldnt even had done it. Luke literaly almost died because he almost fell off board. Maybe if Don didnt tell him maybe he wouldnt never almost died on the cattle ship.

Luke said it was an adventure , it opened up a new world for him, he said ," I am grateful for his opportinity," he says," It made we aware of other people of other coutries and thier needs." he said he was grateful for it he didnt think of it as just doing it because you have to he wanted to do, he saiid once in a lifetime oppuntity, he wanted to he wasn't pushed his choice. In Luke's point of view that was probaly the best choice of his life.
