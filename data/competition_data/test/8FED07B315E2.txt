Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it would be a good idea to do community service because if we do it its helping. Then it will help the community. Also it might help the people learn to do good and not to get in as much trouble. I think if we have community service then it will give people something to do besides staying home and being board. Some people just like to stay home and be lazy and play video games.

I also think doing community service is a good idea because if people wants to exercise then they can get out and pick up some trash or help the environment by help cleaning peoples yard.

Some people cant get out and help because there not in shape or they might not have the strength to get out and help.

if we do community service then our environment we be in better shape.

I think doing community service would be a good idea because the more stuff we pick up the more we can recycle. If we recycle more things then we can have more and more of that product or supplies. Some people hates the idea of doing community service because most people when they even think of the word community service then they think of having to do it because there did something wrong. Community is not all about having to do it because you did something wrong its about helping the county or town.

I think community service is a good thing because every body can get to gather and have a good time cleaning up the town. Community service is not all about having to do it because you did something wrong its about showing how much u care about your community and showing it. So people really doesn't really care about there community at all.

I think doing community service would be a good idea because the more you pick up the better the community looks and fills. Also it might help the people learn to stay out of trouble and be nice. I think it would be a really good idea so the community will be nice and clean.
