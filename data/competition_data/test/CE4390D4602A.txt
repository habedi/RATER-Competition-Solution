Dear principal,

I think you should require students to perform community service because of these reasons. The first reason is because if some students behave bad they could do community service for as many hours you think they deserve to get and it depends of they did if it was bad or really bad.

The other reason is because students should care about taking care o f their community, so the community can stay clean and nice so people could say that is a good an organized community. Students could show an example to the little kids to keep their community to stay clean , nice and organized so people could say something nice about their community.

Another reason is because maybe many students are bored or care about their community so just have them help out in whatever the community needs help on and maybe thank them for helping . But some kids think that community service is a waste of there time because they don't want to help out maybe cause they're to lazy or cause they don't want to help.

The final reason is because kids need to learn not to litter and to be clean so in the future it would be nice for new born babies . That's why i think you should require community service to the students at a school .
