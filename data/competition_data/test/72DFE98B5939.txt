i say policy one because what if we had trouble at school and no one could call the police or a teacher how would we tell any one or what if a fire happened and i got stuck and everyone else got out how would people know i' m stuck in there so i really think its a good idea to have our phones at school and besides why aren't we aloud to have our phones out in class i' m mean its freaking heppicriticle because teachers are aloud to have there phones out and be texting there husbands(if they have one) or boyfriends(again if they have one) and we're not aloud to do that yea there teachers but doesn't mean they are better than us we are all they same no one is better than anyone (unless your Neil Patrick Harris) but yea i mean if they are aloud to then so should we the rights the teachers have a student should have to its not like they going to stop us from learning but yeah i go for policy one because we do need our phones at school just in case something might happen to you.
