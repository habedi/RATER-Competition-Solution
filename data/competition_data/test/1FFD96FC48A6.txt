Dear principal

I a student of this school thinks that no student should be forced to do community service thats just not right, I think it should be a choice to do it or not, kinda like a club there's two types of kids the first type is the lay back do nothing all day. they don't pay attention in school and really don't care. there parents don't care there cause they spoil him/her till the point they get everything they want and when they want. this kind of kid doing community service? ya right good luck then there's the other type of kid who works his/her butt of in school everyday and tries his best in school. they do it because its there goal. there parents encourage them to do better and set a goal for them they don't always get what they want but, to me parents satisfaction to me is more than enough.

for example if there's a kid who would do it just to hang out with friends and get in the way why bother forcing kids to do it when there just going to get in the way. there just going to bug your staff and give them a hard time.

then the kids that look forward to helping the community and will help something. in the long run they find joy in doing it.

Let me ask you a question if you were a kid in middle school and after school would you'll look forward to it or would you rather spend time with your friends. ya i would want to spend time with my friends too. so if you wouldn't do it then why make kids do it?

This is STUDENT_NAME and i approve this message.
