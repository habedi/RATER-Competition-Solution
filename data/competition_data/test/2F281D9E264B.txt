Should students create their own summer project instead of teachers assigning them it? Students like to goof off in them summer and could care very little about school. If students did their own projects some of them might be a good project while others students projects looks like they didn't try at all. Teachers should come up with summer projects because it is more organized for the students to do, easier for the teacher to grade, and it motivates every student to try and put in effort in their projects.

Teachers should assign summer projects because it would be more organized. Many students that I know hardly put in any work writing their own essays in school even when they can write about whatever they want to. Some students don't know how to write a essay or how to even come up with the structure of one so how do people expect students to come up with their own personal summer project. Some students, however, are very creative in coming up with certain project ideas and are able to create or finish a essay easily. Not all students are like this. A lotÂ of students need to be told what to do for a project because they aren't that creative in coming up with ideas for projects and need help.

Assigning summer projects by teachers make it easier for them to grade the project. Teachers usually have a hard time grading essays already even when they assign a certain book that the students are suppose to read. It makes their job twice as harder if the students were allowed to make their own project because its all different topics rather then 1 topic. Some teachers are really good though at grading peoples assignments and know some of the facts students projects. Most teachers, however, are not like this at all and they find it easier for them to just assign one topic for the student to make a project about so that it is easier to grade.

Students lack motivation in doing schoolwork, especially projects. Some students that I have meet could care less about projects even if they have the choice to come up with their own ideas. They see projects as a pointless thing because they are already doing bad at school and the feel like its not gonna help their grade so what's the point. Some students are more motivated in trying to get their grades up and if they were able to make their own projects they would feel more motivated to get better grades. However, not all students think the same way and would rather feel more motivated if teachers handed out the topics for projects rather then make their own project.

Summer projects should be assigned by teachers rather then students make their own summer project. It makes everything easier for both the student and the teacher. It also allow students to easily research the topic so that they can enjoy their summer rather then worry about it all summer. Some students would also procrastinate it and wait till the end if they were to make their own summer projects and it wouldn't be as good of a project as if the teacher were to assign the project.
