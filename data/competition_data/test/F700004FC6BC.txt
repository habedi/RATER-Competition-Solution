Venus today is bizarre to many scientist. It's green appearence and similarity to Earth is why Venus is a must-visit planet to scientist today. Scientist claim it used to have life, habitable for humans and animals, Which it is said to have had water long ago. Proof of it being is because of it having formed structures that we know water would. It has very familiar features with Earth, those being; valleys, mountains, and craters.

The author supports this idea well because of Venus's bizarre terrain and very similar features with Earth. The author includes details such as it's form, relation, and body structure. It is the planet closely similar to our Earth in size and density having the author suggest that their may have been life on the planet of Venus. The author is very interested in Venus because of it's landscape and structure; similar to Earth, it could be a planet that once before held life.

Even though the terrain and atmosphere of Venus is extremely inhospitable, scientist are trying to make a way upon the planet. Idea's like mechanical machines are trying to be used, which a mechanical machine that was tested, has lived on for three weeks in the simulation of Venus's extreme heat. Today, NASA is working on other approaches to Venus as mechanical computers have potential to be used in this giant project of getting a close good look or view of Venus.
