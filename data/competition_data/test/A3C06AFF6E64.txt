There is NO way the "Face on Mars"

was created by alieans. There is definte information that proves anyone wrong that thinks is was created by aliens. First it was proven is was just shadows. Second in 2001 we took a picture in extremely high reslution that shows that is just a mound. Finally if it were created by aliens we would have a man on Mars by now.

The article states in the end of paragraph 2 that is it fake. it says, "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah" This is coming from the leading scientists in the field of space, and that is a small field in witch only a select few get to be in. Just that alone is engouh to prove any conspiracy theory wrong!

In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture in its highest resolution, each pixel was only 1.56 meters wide as opposed to the 43 meters of the Viking photos. what the picture actually showed was a Martian mesa, a landform similer to the ones found in the American southwest. The face as it turns out is only just a mesa, and that is nothing special.

Finally if it were created by aliens don't you think we would be there. The funding that would poor in would be more than enough to put a man or woman on mars. Since it is just a rock formation not created by aliens we have ablsoutely no motive to go there, none at all.
