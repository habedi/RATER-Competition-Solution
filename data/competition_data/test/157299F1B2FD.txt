Venus is our lovely neighboor that we know the basics of. Venus needs to be our pursit despite the dangers of it's challenging surfaces and it's known proximity.

Venus is well know for being Earth's "twin," because of how similar they are to each other. Venus is one of the brightest points in our sky, so why shouldn't we learn more about Venus in depth?

Venus is a lot harder to learn about than what you think. NASA has never been able to send an aircraft to venus because of it's very harsh conditions. Venus atmosphere is very differnt from ours. Venus atmospehere has a blanket of ninety- seven percent of carbon dioxide. As well as a high rate of corrosive sulfric acid. Since venus temperature can range from eight- hundred degrees fahrenheit. NASA has a possible solution that is ready to be tested by floating over Venu's hostile surface and observing. Even though Venus's temperature is ninety times a lot harsher on Venus then what we are used to on Earth there is still a big possibility that NASA is able to do further research and is able to expand our knowledge. Venus is a beauiful planet that we have very limited knowledge about. If we could look over danger posiblities and do more research we could have plentiful visit's to our neighbor.
