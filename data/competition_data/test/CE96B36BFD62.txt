Dear Principal,

I think that community service is good for the students as well as our community. The students should be required to do community service to graduate just not so many hours. I sat this because some of the students also need to do school work, for example some students might need to study for a big test or they might have a lot of homework to do. Some students would love to help but they just might not have enough time in there day. For example lets say that I get home from school at three then I finish my homework at four and finish eating and doing my chores at five thirty then I remember I have a test tomorrow and have to study, I finish studying at six a clock But then I have to take a shower and then walk my dog so I finish at seven and by then it's to dark to do any community service. This is how most kids spend there day at least I do . So you see principal this is why we need to have a limited amount of community service to do. Thank you for reading this letter and I hope you take what I said in consideration.

sincerely,
