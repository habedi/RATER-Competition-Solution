the idea of tis computer is great because this way we could stop kids from being too depressed and go to suicide. this can also help people realize if youre actually helping a studen or child actually happy for them ot to fake a smile. the facial scanner would be a great invention so you help someone whob is sad before they chose their last option.

this machine would help thousands who suffer from depression because it could sense it so it could tell us that we need to see whats going on and how we as friends or even people they dont talk to much help make a difference. i think this could help the teen suicidal rate go down because many do it because they feel alone so if it could pick that up we could talk to them about it and help them.

so therefore this computer recognition idea shoulld be sold everywhere to helpothers realise how they can or what they an do to help or realize that people have feelings too.
