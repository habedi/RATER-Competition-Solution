I would type the more thorough answer, but being timed prevents me from doing that, so I'll make it quick.

The main advantage I noticed is the decrease in air pollution. Being able to produce smog across an entire city like Paris is impressive alone, but...after reading

Paragraph 17 in Source 2

("Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..."), I'm not all too surprised. Another thing I'm not surprised about are French delivery companies whining about not getting paid enough during the ban (

Paragraph 18, Source 2

). Guess what: It's just money, green sheets of decorated paper. Deal with it!

Also, I noticed that Bogota holds a "Car-Free Day" once a year. Honestly, I say "Well played." Treating it as an annual tradition is the right move to get a group of people, regardless of amount, to do something. It's been getting positive comments (

Paragraph 24, Source 3

), as well, which is a sign that it will last a long time. To sum it up, the second advantage is that it gives people the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors.

That's basically the most brief explanation I can give that makes sense.
