Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that changing this policy will affect a lot of people in different ways. This switch will probably be a good thing in the long term for most people, motivating them to get better grades. Colleges and Universities that are looking for athletes look for grades before they even see them on the court or field. The same goes for other activities like band or cheer leading also. For some people, who are to lazy or just don't care, this might get them to do their homework, or even pay attention in class, because most of these students really like sports and are probably pretty good at them. This change might make parents' of these students mad or frustrated, because they think their kids cant do any better than they already are. So you might want to increase the margin for error to right between a B and a C average. I would like to see this change take place to make my surroundings better for everyone.

After college is a whole new story in life and trying to get a job or starting a career is one of the main problems. All the well paying jobs look for high grades in college and good conduct. So getting motivated at a young age to get good grades is a great thing in my opinion.

Sincerely,
