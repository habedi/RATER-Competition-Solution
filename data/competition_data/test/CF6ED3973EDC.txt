Statistics show that when teachers help students one on one they are more likely to recieve better standards on school work then when teachers do not work with students. Many people believe that summer projects are un-necessary because students work all school year and now it's their summer break. Although, in reality, summer projects help keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers themselves because this gives the students insight on the teacher's style of instructing, it maintains equal opportunities to all students, it keeps the structure of a standardized school project.

To begin with, as a student, being familiar with the teaching style of your instructors is a very necessary component to doing well in certain classes. All teachers have a differnet style of teaching; depending on the way they feel comfortable conducting their lessons. However, not all students may be able to adapt to the style of a specific teacher. By assigning a teacher-designed summer assignment, this gives students the opportunity to take a quick glance at the way specific teachers conduct their lessons. This allows students to not only be ahead but also prepared at the start of the school year, knowing how their instructor assigns work.

Furthermore, teacher-designed summer assignments maintain an equal opportunity to all students. This means, all students will be assigned the same project by the same teachers. Sometimes when students work together they may not be able to completely agree, meaning when they create a summer assignment; some students may not like the project and its format. However, if the assignment is created by the teachers themselves, it means the students can't question eachother, but only rely on the teachers abilities.

Additionally, throughout the school year teachers will assign projects to students using not only school-wide but their own standards. If the summer projects assigned to students were created by the teachers themselves, the project will maintain this standard implemented by both the school board and staff. Unlike students, teachers have plenty of experience when it comes to educating young adults. Due to the experince teachers have in their field of study, they can create a better, more structured assignment using their personal views and insights on the subject. Many people may say that if the project was student-designed then the students could relate to the project more or the project would be more understandable. However, the students may accidentally cut corners when creating the project anf be held accountable. When teachers design the summer assignment, it maintains a well-rounded format and is also related to the lessons throughout the acedmic year.

In conclusion, summer projects keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Projects that are created and assigned by the teachers are more reliable knowing the assignment has a standardized structure and will contain all the details in conducting the project. Allthough students may want to create a project they can easily complete due to the fact they created it, the project may not have all of the details it needs and will not contain the format implemented by the staff themselves.Â
