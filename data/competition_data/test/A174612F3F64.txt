Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

I wrote this letter to ask you to remove the "B" average rule. I think this should be changed because some kids highest point might just be a "C" average and in fact half of the students on the school's sports teams has a "C" average.

I think it would be fair for the players and coaches if you let this go by. I'm not saying the students should just stride just for a "C" average so they could play school sports. I just hate the fact that if the policy of a "C" average changes to a "B" just to play sports that most kids would get put off the team when probably half of the students with "C" averages are putting all their effort into their class work and a "C" average is probably the best grade they could look at following their hard work they put in. I hope this letter changed your mind about changing the school policy to a "B" average to play sports.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
