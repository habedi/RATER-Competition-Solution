School can be overwhelming for students. Some students might not like being at school because of the people it consists of or it might be because they don't want to be here. If a student is responsible and would like to take classes at home, I think they should. I think students could benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it can be more comfortable, convienent, and life preparing for the student.

Students may not like the classroom environment. Therefore, attending classes from home could help benefit by making them feel more comfortable in their environment. Some students may not like interacting with others which could lead to isolation in the classroom. This could make students feel uncomfortable and not want to come to class. If a student is at home they will feel more comfortable with the people in their household than the students and staff at school. Along with that, some students and staff can make students feel uncomfortable. Students constantly bully one another, making them feel bad about themselves. Staff members can make students feel uncomfortable by their disrespectful behavior. Personally, I have delt with both of these things. I've been bullied before because of what I used to wear and my facial features. I was recieving endless comments and hate. Due to this I never wanted to come to school, then later I realized I shouldn't care about what people say about me. In a situation like this different students could have handled it differently. Some students could have not come to school and persue in homeschooling and could stand up for themselves and come to school. Teachers and staff also have an effect on the students. Sometimes teachers show me attitude when I haven't done anything to them. To teachers especially I have never talked back, shown attitude, or even made facial expressions. Even if my teachers show me attitude or blame me for something I didn't do, I never disrepect them. The fact that they're rude to me and disrespect me makes me feel uncomfortable in the classroom because it shows that they have something against me. An example would be when I walked into my marketing class late. I was talking to one of my teachers about my personal problems which resulted in being 10 minutes late. I walked into my marketing class with a pass my teacher signed for me and my marketing teacher snatched the pass out of my hand, ripped it in half and said "go sit down and do work". She said that to me in an awful tone making me want to cry. Most teachers don't know what I'm dealing with and the fact that she said that to me made me want to cry. Some staff members can also make others feel uncomfortable by glaring at them. An expample would be when I had a male substitute for a class and he always stared at me and smiled. He also asked for personal information which I didn't feel comfortable giving. If students took classes at home it could benefit them because they don't have to directy interact with teachers and students regularly. Both of my situations could've been avoided if I took classes from home.

Taking classes at home can also be more convienent for students. Students will have the ability to use the bathroom whenever they need to without having to constantly ask their teachers. Leaving the classroom to use the bathroom it creates a distraction for others in their learning environment by having to open and close the door. The doors are a little loud when opening and closing which could disturb students. Also, many kids use the bathroom during class and teachers often tell them to wait till instructions are over. This causes the student to feel uncomfortable because they really need to use the bathroom. Some teachers also have a certain number of bathroom passes for students to take. One day in class I really needed to use the restroom so I went to get a pass and there weren't any left, so I patiently had to wait for the student to come back. The student did eventually come back 20 minutes later which made me really mad because he didn't even go to the bathroom. I found out that the student was roaming the halls for the past 20 mins. Also, if classes were being taken at home there wouldn't be any bathroom fights or mishaps. Students often vandalize the bathrooms for their own enjoyment. This is a terrible thing students do and can be prevented by taking classes at home.

Students can become better prepared for the real world by being able to attend classes from home. It allows them to have more responsibility on themselves by actually completing the tasks assigned by the instructor. Some students may take advantage of this time by thinking of it as "free time", but not doing the work will bring them to a disadvantage in the future. Students who complete the assigned tasks are preparing themselves for the real world because they are taking responsibilty to do the work. They are doing the work with out the teacher or instructor telling them to. They show integrety which most jobs look for when hiring. At an actual job there isn't going to be someone constantly making sure you are doung your work. If you decide not to do your work, you'll be fired. Being able to do work by yourself with out a teacher looking over you will better prepare you for the work field in the future.

School is a very important aspect of our lives. It allows us to make new friends, gain new experiences, and to make and learn from our mistakes. Taking classes at home could greatly benefit students by having them feel comfortable in their environment, having conveinent personal problems, and by preparing better for the real world. Taking classes from home could be a gateway to a new world.
