Dear Principal,

I think the new school policy is a great idea. Playing sports and participating in other activities is a privilege. So if students can't maintain a B average then I think they don't deserve to play sports or do other activities. I like this policy because there are many students who are struggling with their grades that like to play sports or do other activities. So this will encourage them to boost their grades up. If students are struggling academically then this will give them another reason to try and keep their grades up. Even though they may not realize it, this will be helping them in another way, it will also help their GPA and make them more qualified for better schools rather than students with C averages. So if these students really have a desire for sports then they will try their hardest to keep their grades up. Frankly, I think this would work because I know there are a lot of students that love sports and other activities so they will keep striving for that B average.

Yours truly,
