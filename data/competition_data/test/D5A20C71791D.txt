Dear Principal,

I think that giving every kid in the school community service would be good for the school because it will help the community out and help others. I will give out three examples to prove it would be a good thing to give kids in school community service. First example, most kids always say they have nothing to do after school, so make a program with a lot of kids that have nothing to do after school because it will give them something to do.

Second example, most kids also like doing things that will help their community because it helps other and more people will want to do the same. Third example, make community service ex. credit for all the kids that want to join the program of community service because it would help every kid out and then in the next year, a lot of other school will want to do the same thing. I think community service should be required to all student in all schools because it would help them out if the principal would make it ex. credit and then again it would help out the community to look better. That's why I think community service would be great for kids in all schools. Maybe their parents would help the thing go on as well and others would come and join the community service for the community. It would make the principal and other teachers better and learn things from students. Thank you for reading my letter about community service (if kids should or shouldn't have to do it for school.)

sincerely,
