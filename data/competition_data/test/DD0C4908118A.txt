Dear

TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a good thing. Students that are my friends should have to help out their community. I mean we live here. Some people like to be lazy and take no part in our community. One day me and my friend were on a walk, and out of the blue, she threw her wrapper on the ground. I told her that, that is wrong, to pick it up so i made her. she said sorry and picked it up. then a different tie me and my friends went up to the OTHER_NAME wreck park and we decided to pick up the trash. we were so amazed how much of it there was so then this group of kids came by and started helping us pick it all up. That was awesome! I would be scared to see our community completely trashed. I think keeping our community clean and, having students do community service is very important.

From,
