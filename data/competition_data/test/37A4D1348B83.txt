Dear Principal,

I think the first policy is the best because if a student needs his or her cell phone for an emergency they will have is to call for help. If we had the second policy then if a student sees someone with a gun for example then they can't call the police. Or if some one if beaten and needs medical attention they can call 911. If someone uses them in class or when there not supposed to then the phone should be taken until a parent come to get it. People can save a life with a phone or report a crime that happened before their very eyes.

Policy two could potentially spell the end of someone. Most would break policy two because they might need to call someone after school. The first policy is very easy to follow, just use your phone during lunch and other free periods. There will be the occasional rule breaker for the policy one but policy two will have a lot more. If a schools power is out and people are locked in they will need cell phones to call for help.

In the end policy one has a more beneficial affect for students. Without cell phones someone's life could be in danger and they have no contact with anyone else. With a cell phone a life can be saved or an accident can be prevented. So please if you have to pick any policy let it be policy one.
