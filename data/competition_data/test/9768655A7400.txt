I believe that it would be a cool thing to have in a classroom. It would entertain kids after they are done with work and it would give you an idea of who is happy more often.

First of all, the technology would be able to tell what percent happy, disgusted, fearful, and angry someone is. The technology might even be able to turn your day around. If you make a funny face into the experiment do you think it might turn your day around just a little? As stated in the article, "putting on a happy face really works!" The things this experiment can do may give children an idea of what they want to do when they are older. If a child is interested in the software then he or she may pursue that as their occupation when they are older so they can make things for younger kids like the ones who did for them.

There are so many positive reasons I would enjoy them being in classrooms. The negatives are slim and just for that they should be slowly moved into schools.
