Dear principal,

I am a student here at the school and I am going to tell you the phone policy that should be chosen for this school. The policy best for students would be policy 1. The reason for this is so that when students have an emergency they can just pull out their phones and use them to call or text any one they need instead of going all the way to the office. For example if they get hurt and no is around they could call for help.

The second reason for my decision is because during class they could always use their teachers phone or class phone and it will show the teachers that students can be responsible enough to do their class work while their phones are off. The third reason for this decision is they could maybe talk to their parents about if their is practice or something like that. For example if the school closes for a weather emergency, the student could call any type of parent and tell them what the students plains are for the day if needed so the parents don't need to worry about their children while they are at work. As stated above in the sentences I as a student here

Thank you dearly,
