Projects, we all had them before. Usually when given a project a teacher gives them,and projects by a teacher isn't exciting its rather boring. Especially when it's over the summer. The projects are boring because teachers doesn't have a very creative mind like students. With that being said students should design the projects even the ones they do over the summer. Students should design the projects because they have more of a creative mind than teachers, they know what other students would like, and they will have fun with the project.

Students have more of a creative mind than teachers. Their mind can help them with finding unique things for each of the students to write about in their projects. With them doing that they can show that they learned something and they found something interesting to talk about with the class and the teacher. Also the teacher can see that the students are responsible ,can do things by themselves, and can make a good project worth talking about. The students projects can also show the people who are higher up in the school systems that you can let students be in charge of things they usually wouldn't let students be in charge of.

When doing an activity such as a project, you should let a student conduct it because the know what other students would like. Since students typically know what other students would like, students would be interested in what the project is about because it came from it's peers and not the teacher. If it from their teacher than the students would find much interest in the project at all because teachers typically would give students something that they don't find interesting and it turns into something they dread doing,but they would have to do in order to get the grade they need. When students do that you can tell they didn't like the project. You can tell by how much effort they put into it and how the presented it to everyone. So it's best to let the students control because they typically know what other students like.

Whenever you let students take control,students will have fun with the project. Students will have fun wit the project because their getting to do something they want to do. With them doing that it helps them have a better project. If they enjoyed what they were doing because it shows in their work. You can see the extreme amount of effort they put in and how happy they were to present it to everyone. You can also see how proud they were of themselves in the process of doing this project.

Some people may think that students shouldn't be in control of a project. Some people may think that because they say that students are irresponsible,to playful,and disobedient. They may also think that since they're kids they won't follow through with anything. Little do they know students are hardworking and can finish anything they put their mind and their heart to as long as their dedicated. Just because they're kids doesn't mean you should underestimate them on what they are capable of doing.

People should start giving students a chance including teachers. They should start giving students a chance because they never know what students are capable of. Students are capable of a lot of things when they are dedicated to do it. With the reasons that i have explained above projects should be student- designed because they have more o a creative mind than teachers,they know what other student would like, and they will have fun with the project.
