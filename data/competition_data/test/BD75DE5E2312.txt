The use of cellphones while driving should not be allowed at all. People put themselves and others at risk, safety should always go first. Throughout the years cell phone use has increased a lot. People use cell phones daily, sometimes when walking you don't notice where you're going and bump into someone. That's something minor but let's say you're driving while using you're device that's major, a car accident may be caused.

I believe cell phones should not be used while driving because it's a big distraction. Car wrecks would be avoided, which decreases the amounts of deaths. Also the person that was distracted is most likely the one to put at fault this may lead to lawsuits. Even if texting while driving were to be legal that does not mean it is safe. We should avoid all types of distractions while driving.

Another reason is because if you are caught using you're phone while driving by a cop or because of an accident. You're car insurance will be affected, if you were already paying a lot it's most likely that the payment will now be doubled. That could be easily avoided, another reason is that you shouldn't put at risk your passengers. It is better be safe than sorry.

There is a lot of reasons this should not be allowed. Safety should be taken serious. Car accidents, lawsuits, being hospitalized is not a joke, people die due to others being distracted when they're on their phones while driving. We should avoid any type of distraction while driving to avoid bad consequences.
