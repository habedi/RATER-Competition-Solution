Emotion's, a common thing in every day to day life. Something to us that indicate quite easily, either being a guessing game, or knowing for a fact what they expressing. But can a computer compet against the human mind? After many of learning/performing the same task that a computer can do to figure human emotions and such? I think not!

First thing, I'll like to point that yes, Dr. Huang created a computer software to,"Precisely enough to convey specific emotions.", but you gotta think, computer can mess up. Emotion's can not only be indicated my facial expression, but also tone of the individual. Plus, is it really a big deal to spend money to figure out different peoples emtion when we can simple just look at them, and say, "Hey!

He/She looks quite upset.".

Secondly, I'll like to point out that, what the hassle to make a program, when a normal "Home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode" emotions. This can even done even better by just looking at a mirror and just copying down their exact facial expression to figure out how they were feeling, and wasting time to encode and create a software to see different types of emotions that could possible fail at doing.

I'm not saying that computer shouldn't be able to perform task humans do always, like there are time where this can sorta useful. For example from the text,"Make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games... communications." having some benefits. But just for seeing facial features for emotions, we could easily do that on our own.

So, can i computer can copet to the human to the human mind, to compet to figure out if someone either feels happy or said? Well, that's your desicion to decide that. But do remember, can a PC compet to us human ?
