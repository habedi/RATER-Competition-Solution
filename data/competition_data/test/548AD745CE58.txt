Driving & Phones

For a couple of years now a lot of people have been dying, getting hurt, and a lot of car crashes happen because of texting and driving. No one ever realizes what texting and driving can do to a person and anyone on the road. If there is one person on their phone around a bunch of other cars that puts everyone else in danger no matter what. The phones is what gets everyone killed on the road because it is such a distraction to people behind the wheel and they don't have the patience to get somewhere then check it. Phones are pretty much taking over a lot of peoples life's because they are so hooked to it.

In my personal opinion people should not be able to use their cell phones while driving or when operating any kind of vehicle. It puts the person using the phone and all of the other pedestrians around them. Every cell phone company should make all their phones have censors in them for when people start driving their vehicles and would make the phone unusable. The worst part is that people could carless about the other people about themselves. That's why there is so many deaths coming from crashes because there is always that one person that is on their phone and not looking where they're going.

The fact that everything is on your cell phone makes it worse because you receive a notification and you automatically have to check it. People nowadays do not have the patience to wait to get somewhere to answer the message or whatever they receive. Everyone is basically addicted to their phones which isn't a good thing at all because as technology gets better maybe it could fix the being on your phone while driving or it can make it worse. If cell phone companies were to find a way to put sensors in a phone and then when they sensor you using your phone it automatically locks it. That would put all of the drivers in a better environment because now they won't have to worry about getting hit by a driver that is too busy distracted on their phone.

Putting sensors into phones won't be a bad idea but not everyone will buy the latest phone and getting drivers to not use their phone while driving will probably impossible. Companies can also change that if u get a notification it says it out loud so you won't have to pick your phone up. They could also make it to where you can only answer phone calls if someone wants to contact you instead of receiving text messages. Although they did pass a law where you get pulled over and given a ticket they are still not stopping texting and driving. There will still be those couple of people that still use their phones.

Basically to sum everything into one paragraph I was talking about how texting and driving is so distracting and putting all of the people around them in danger. It is not safe at all to be using your phone while driving and even if you are at a stop at a red light you still shouldn't pull it out to check something on it. When getting a notification you should just wait until you get to your destination and then check and answer it. Even with saying all of that people still won't understand how many people they are putting in danger and only worry about them selves. Just don't text and drive and wait till you get somewhere to answer the text or whatever you received.
