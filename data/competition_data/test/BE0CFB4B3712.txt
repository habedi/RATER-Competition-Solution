I am a Seagoing Cowboy. I have experienced many different places. I have been to Greece, Europe, China and more. You should definately become a Seagoing Cowboy because you get to experience places you would not get to experience if you were not a Seagoing Cowboy.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you make many friends. You get to help take care of horses, cows, and mules. By 1947, I made 9 different trips, the most of any seagoing Cowboy! Not only do you have fun doing all of this, but you also get prepared for hard work in the future. You also play fun games such as volleyball and table tennis. We also fenced, boxed, read, and whittled to pass the time. Being a Segoing Cowboy makes you much more aware about the world and its people. There are many things countries need. You also have lots of fun on board, especially on return trips from unloading the animals. All of the fun on board made the month long trip to China seem short. When I was in Greece I even got to see the Acropolis! It was very special. I also turned 18 before arriving in Greece, so i could be drafted in the military. We finally arrived on August 14, which was the day the Pacific war ended!

In Conclusion, I would definately recommend becoming a Seagoing cowboy, because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and it is very fun, while you also learn a lot along the way.
