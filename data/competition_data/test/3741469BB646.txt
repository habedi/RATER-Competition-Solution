Is online school the best way for students to learn in this generation? Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. By giving students this option they will continue their schooling through being home schooled. Many parents would most likely have their students take an online class especially if their student is a student who plays sports. I think students should refrain themselves from taking online classes because they could have a lack of focus, if they need help in a subject they can consult their friends or a teacher in person, and they would be better off working in a class setting.

In a general class the max of a high school class is about 30 students. If you're a student who likes to focus in a smaller class they can always make arrangements. Working in a classroom can help you stay in check and prevent you from losing focus. There are so many distractions that can come towards taking an online course. You could be persuaded into watching t. v or playing video games. With that being said, you would have to set a lot of ground rules for yourself to prevent you from falling into those temptations.

Many students tend to find subjects that they are taking very difficult, but that shouldn't discourage them in asking for help. That is the bright side of taking classes in school, because you will always have people to help you. Having that one on one communication with a teacher, in person, is the best way to help. You can never go wrong with communicating with a teacher or a friend. Being able to sit and listen to ways that can give you a better understanding on something you don't understand is a great way on getting better.

Working in a class setting would be better off than online. With a class setting, students can work on their assignments hands on. In that way, the students are familiar with the source and can help them to remember in case they would ever need it again. Also, you wouldn't have to worry about working on assignments by yourself, because you will always have others to help if needed. Although there are benefits of working one on one communication with an online teacher, being that you will always have that teacher there for yourself, a student will not get the same learning skills as they wold in a class setting.

Overall parents and students should communicate within themselves to see which area would be best for their students. When it comes to school and sports there should always be a balance and not one way out. Online school might be tempting to take, but there's nothing better than taking classes in a school. There are also many source if you are having trouble rather that would be with online databases or teacher/student help. There is always a better way to strengthen your education. Taking courses in school is the way to go. Be ready to see your friends and teachers in person everyday!Â
