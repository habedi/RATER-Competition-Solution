Summer projects, some schools have these projects to complete during the summmer so students do not have to completley stop learning during the break. The assignments are more than likely created by a teacher; What if the students created the assignments though?

i believe that if student's created the project it would probably be easier than a teachers project, for the benefit of summer. On the other hand if teachers designs the project it will come with more work and more information for the benefit of real learning.

Student designed projects, in my opinion, will probably help teachers in the short run because of the fact that teachers will not have to worry about creating a project. In the long run though, i believe students will not learn anything new. i think student's will just create it and make it easy just to get it over with and begin their summer. Or make it easy enough to just procrastinate about it all break and complete it at the end of summer. Even creating the project is more work for the students which i think will have some students not even trying to do it. If the project is created by students i think mostly all of the students will complete it and turn it in because of how easy they made it to be.

Teacher designed projects, These projects will have what the teacher's and school want students to study during break. Teachers will actually create it to be work that will leave students with information that is needed and that should not be forgotten, for future puposes like for classes that they will be taking when back from break. I think a good amount of people would not complete the assignment due to the fact that teachers make them hard and actually have you do work. Students would rather be doing anything than a project during the summer. Teacher designed projects will help students out more in the long run because teacher's know what students need to study and focus on.

So, in my opinion a teacher designed project is for the benefit of the student's learning. A student designed project though, is for the benefit of the student's summer. In both cases though the student is going to be working on it thoughout summer and keeping in touch with learning. I think it would be best if a teacher designed project was given for the summer. If the chance was given to me to create one though, i would definetly rather do that.Â
