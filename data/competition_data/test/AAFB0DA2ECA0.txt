In my very honest opinion, phones should not be allowed to use while driving. There are so many reasons why they shouldn't. There could be children in the car. Also, getting stopped by the police is everybody's worst dream. Lastly, it's not safe.

To begin with, texting and driving could be extremely dangerous when kids are in the car. First, while somebody is using their phone while driving, it could cause a big accident if they aren't paying attention to what's going on in front of them. There are more texting and driving accidents then drunk driving accidents. People mostly focus on their phone then focusing and staying behind the wheel not crashed into a tree.

Moreover, everyone knows getting stopped by the police isn't the best thing. The tickets cost a lot on money and sometimes is very hard to pay. Even some police may be harsh and might even take you in to court. Nobody wants to get stopped and pay for the price.

In addition, texting and driving is obviously not safe. Every year, at least 200,000 people experience accidents caused by texting while behind the wheel. The way the number keep increasing is honestly awful and so sad. I'm hoping that more in the future the number will decrease rather then increasing.

In conclusion, I have made my point that texting and driving is no where near acceptable. There is accident after accident each month & dealing with a loss is very sad. Not only can it affect whoever is in the car, but it can also affect those around.
