Dear Principal,

I understand that cell phones can be a distraction during school and that you are trying to decide on a policy. I think that it would be a good idea to allow students to use their cell phones during lunch and free times. We should allow students to use their cell phones because it would give them time to text their friends so that they wouldn't have to do it during class and become a distraction, they would be less tempted to use it during class if they knew that could have it out right as class was over, and need their cell phones to call people in case of an emergency.

If students had time to use their cell phones during free times, they wouldn't have to have to sneak in text while walking through the halls, and it gives them time to get one last phone call in, or one last text in so that they wouldn't need to text during class. And turning your phone off when you get in class really isn't that hard at all. Students like to socialize with cell phones so I think it is good for them to be able to socialize a bit more.

They would be a lot less tempted to use it during class if they had the opportunity to use it during lunch or while walking through the halls. It wouldn't be such an essential to text your really good friend during class because you could just use it before or after you get to class. This could also help with tarties, students wouldn't have to go all the way to the other side to the school to find their friend and be late to class, they could just text them or call them telling them what they wanted to tell them on their way to class making tarties less of an issue.

Emergencies can happen at any time of the day and students need to have their cell phones to call someone to come get them or call the police. Cell phones can be very helpful in any emergency. If a fire happens they can just call their parents to come pick them up rather than waiting for a long time for the school to call all the kid's parents that don't have cell phones. Also if you have a cell phone and your friend doesn't they can just use yours instead of waiting like all the other students, and it can help out the school by creating less people to have to use the schools phone and it will be less of a hassle for the school.

Cell phones can be a great use for everyone and teenagers like to have their cell phones with them. Having a cell phone and being able to use it during lunch and free time would make students not need it as much during class time. It would make students not be tarty as often. In emergencies a cell phone can be very useful. Giving students the opportunity to have cell phones during free time and lunch would also teach the students responsibility and it would make them much happier.
