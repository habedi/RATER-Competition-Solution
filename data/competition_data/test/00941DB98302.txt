Kids should do things like extracurricular activities, so they can have fun, make new friends or be with your best friend, and get something bad off their mind. Yes I agree that the principal should do something nice like that for the kids.

I think it is a good thing for the school because the students can do something they like. I also think the students should do it because they have many choices to choose from. The student will have fun doing something they really love to do. If the students really love what they are doing, they might want to do it in the real world to help others out. Thats why I agree with the printable because it can be fun for the students and do something nice for them. I also think all schools should do this so your school can have fun to and your student will have more things to choose from.

I also think it will be good for the students because they can make new friends. For the kids that do not have any friends they can go to one of the extracurrcuirs activities and just start to talk and maybe someone will want to be their friend. You can also pick one that your friend is in so you and your friend can be together in the same extracurricular activity. This can also helps schools because more kids will want to do to extracurricular activities and will soon become friends with each other then it will be less problems in the schools.

This could also help because some kids can be going through some things and this can help relax their mind from all the negative things that is going on in their life. This can help them have fun and don't think of the things that is going on outside of school. The actives can also help solve the problems that is going on in this kid life so the kid can get some help. I think this is good because this can help many kids and schools.

I think this is good because this can help a lot of kids and many kids will like it because they are just having fun. I think all schools should do this because it will be good for the students and will problem help out the community in some ways. I really do agree that this is a good to do I think my school should do this to one day because I know my school will love it.
