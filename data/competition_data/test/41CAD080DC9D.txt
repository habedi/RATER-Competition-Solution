Dear principal,

I strongly believe that you should choose the first policy. One reason is that, even if you ban cell phones from school students will still be bringing them to school no matter what. Also, if there were to be an emergency in the school, I don't believe that there would be enough phones at the school to inform each parent at once. Next, cell phones wouldn't cause a problem if each student were to turn it off in class and then be able to use them at lunch.

Each student should be able to bring a cell phone to school so that they can carry it around in case of an emergency. For example, lets say that someone breaks into the school during the day and the students are in danger. There would not be enough time to call each parents, but if students were to have a cell phone they could call or send a text message to their parents telling them what's wrong. Also, if you ban cell phones, I know that there are students out there that enjoy getting in trouble, but if u were to not ban them, the students wouldn't feel the need to be a pet peeve.

Then again i strongly suggest you choose the first policy due to emergencies and the need to save yourselves from getting mad at students if they bring their cell phones to school. Please consider my suggestion and thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Student
