The possible consequences which may stem from forcing anyone to set aside one of their most essential resources, that being time, in favor of performing an activity that, prior to the former action, had neither affected nor interested are not observed clearly enough, in many cases. A person's free time is, for the most part, an opportunity for them to enjoy themselves, if they wish, or to not. The choice is surely their's and their family's, not that of an outsider. Indeed, no student should be made to unwillingly take part in an extracurricular activity. This is due to their extremely busy schedules, as well as the necessity to protect their personal freedoms and interests. Free time is such a valuable commodity to school children that taking it away could negatively impact them in various ways.

Children are exceedingly busy. Their schedules may allow barely any extra time, and they are therefore forced to sacrifice something in order to engage in an extracurricular activity. A student of any grade deals with large amounts of homework, and the quantities only grow as they progress through the school system. They must also complete their chores at home, as well as any jobs, such as walking dogs or baby sitting, that they have chosen to take on. Interfering with their lives could result in declining grades, a loss of interest in formerly enjoyable activities, and rising tensions at home, a place where schools should possess little power.

A principal should be unable to control students' activities outside of the school. Students have their own livelihoods wherein schools would be remiss to interfere if they are unwelcome. The interruption of the day to day life of their families may not be welcomed, and could result in spats between members. A boundary is being crossed when a principal is able to force a student to participate in an activity that is entirely separate from the school and which they may not want any part in, for the child may already have their own personal interests that do not involve any extracurricular activities.

Forcing students, who may simply have interests which lie elsewhere, to take part in extracurricular activities may only succeed in becoming a deleterious factor to their enjoyment of their work and activities. Students who enjoy other pastimes, such as reading and spending time with family, would find the time utilized for the aforementioned activities cut into or taken away. Those attempting to focus on succeeding academically may suddenly be mandated to decide between complying with their principal and completing their assignments. It is cruel to expect students to comply with a rule which throws their interests and aspirations to the wind.

Seeing as how students struggle with busy schedules, the principals of schools ought to be prohibited from mandating them to engage in extracurricular activities. Student's freedoms and interests are experiencing the risk of being overturned. The interference with families and free time may harm the students a great deal more than it would help them, and the principal has no authority to step that far into a student's personal life. The consequences of such an action must be considered, as they have the potential to severely harm a student.
