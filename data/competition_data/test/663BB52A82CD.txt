"Venus, which has often referred to as Eart's 'twin,' it is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasnally the closest in distance too." Was stated in the article "The challenge of Exploring Venus". The author argues his point that studying Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the danger it presents by inform the data that collected by different reaserchers.

The article first described the climates and the condition on Venus, also how it is different on Earth. " A think atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even moore challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." By giving out more information of a planet that is unknown to audience, it creates a more clear setting of what it is like on Venus. "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals," describes how much hotter it is on Venus and the living condition on that planet gies up more backgrounds.

After enough description of cruelty on Venus, it leads to author's point, "If our sister plaet is so inhospitable, why ae scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?" He also gave out the reason in the next sentence," because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."

In paragraph 4, he states that although Venus has more pressure and extreme hot temperature, there is still some features that are similar to Earth, such as valleys, mountains and craters on the surface of Venus, just like on Earth.

In paragraph 5, NASA's data was used as an evidence to prove author's point. Although the temperatures would be still a lot more higher than Earth, but the air pressure woud be close to the sea level on earth when it is at thirty-plus miles above the Venus' surface. This prove that it is survivable for human, just not easy conditions.

In the end, author emphases that "venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers it presents" by stating how this study could benefit human. "Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." Also he mentioned the study shouldn't be limited by dangers and doubt.
