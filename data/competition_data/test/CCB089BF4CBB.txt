When it comes to talking about choosing between a project over summer break, should it be where the student can choose their own design, or where the project is designed by the teacher.

I think that if a school has a summer project it should be student-designed, so that the student will want to do the project over summer.

When a student does something one does not like; one does not usually remember doing the project when one needs to present in class.

If a student can have a choice of any subject to do a project as long as school appriorate over summer the one can enjoy and choose; also will make students more energetic to complete the project on time.

Students should be able to design their own projects because the students will be able to express their feelings, emotions, and inner thoughts.

When students usually start working a design made by them they start with how the feel in the moment and how they have felt in the past.

The first thing that starts to show when a student is working on a design made by them is one's feelings towards the subject that the student's is working on.

When someone expresses their feelings in this way one puts a lot of effort into the project and will make the project really show and really speak.

Mainly because it is a reflection of how the student's feelings are shown on the subject for the project.

Also when a student tends to show one's feelings it tends to make the student work and be more positive and happy.

The reason being the student is able to do something they like and not being forced to do something they do not like.

When students are working on a design that is their choice and the student is working with one's feeling on a subject the students true emotions start to show.

When it comes to the second thing, the student starts to add their emotion about the subject deep down and how their emotions are truly.

When a student shows their emotions one wants to be heard in a positive way; if the student has a choice to design a project on a subject student's choice the student tends to be happier and is will to work on the project.

Meaning the student is not upset when they are forced to do a project over break because they get to choose and show their own emotions on the subject that the student chooses.

When it comes to choosing between a teacher most likely making the project based on book work, or the student enjoying summer doing a project that the student designed.

Also the student would be able to work with either a friend, or a family member.

When a student starts to show one's feelings and emotions towards a subject of the students choice, the student tends to start to show their true thoughts towards the subject by choice.

The third thing that shows the most when a student designs their own project over summer it will show their true inner thought on the project that the student is designing.

When a student starts to show their true inner thought on a project; one tends to be more vocal on the subject the designed because it is how they really feel deep down.

Meaning when one starts to talk about their own thought; they talk in a more positive direction and try to be more friendly because the student wants someone to listen.

Also when students are talking about their opinion; the students get a chance to express how they feel inside.

Mainly because in today world students do not have a say on how the schools are run and the students should be able to choose their own design.

When talking about student-designed projects and teacher-designed projects people needs to talk about both sides, teacher-designed projects can be fun and helpful to learn from also to teach with.

When talking about teacher-designed projects, people need to also realize some students are not capable enough to create their own design and needs a teacher-designed project instead of a student-designed project.

When talking about projects designed by teachers for over summer; some of the projects are fun and exciting, but some are just book work and studying.

Mainly because the students should be entertained by what they are learning and being able to learn something from the project.

When mentioned a minute ago, teacher-designed projects can be helpful in the meaning of learning how to grow plants, or learning the chemical reaction in putting mentos and coca-cola.

The reason being some students when they grow up want to be a gardener and some want to be scientists.

The main thing is that students should be able to choose their own design for their projects during break because it is the students own time and they should be able to express their own feelings towards subjects they like.

When it comes to talking about teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects, people have to remember that everyone should have a choice on the work they have to do during their own break.

When a student makes a choice on what they have to do over break is based of how they feelings about the topic at the time.

Also when a student works on their own design they tend to start putting more emotion into the design because they chose what they wanted to do.

Mainly, but most of all, when a student works on a subject the students share their inner thoughts with the world.

Students should be able and be capable to design their own projects and choose the subject so they can express how they really feel deep down about the subjects so they can talk about how they feel.

When wondering which side to take both are good but there has to be a choice either teacher-designed projects over summer break, or student-designed projects over break.
