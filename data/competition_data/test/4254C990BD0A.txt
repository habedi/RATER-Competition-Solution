I think that students should have to do community service in their schools. If students have to do community service than that means that the more needy people that need help will have more people to help them with something. Another reason why I think that we should make community service needed is that there would be more people to help the environment which would reduce pollution in rivers and lakes and also it would reduce litter on the ground in public places like parks. One more reason why we should make community service needed is because it would also make teenagers more responsible.

If more people did community service that would mean that more people would be able to help out other older people with things that they cannot do like lift boxes or something else that would be difficult for them to complete. If older people had to do something that is hard for them then they could get injured seriously with what could happen to them. Like if an older man tries to lift a heavy box and tries to carry it upstairs he could fall down backwards and break his back or maybe even something worse.

If more people helped out with community service than that means that there would also be less pollution and litter. The more people that help out the more people will pick up garbage off the ground or out of rivers. If there were less people helping out that would mean that there is more litter in parks and in rivers and we are contaminating our environment. It would also keep animals from dyeing because they ate the litter or pollution in the park or in the river where they live.

If community service was needed that means that teenagers would become more responsible because they would not just throw their garbage on the ground because they might have to pick it up later. Also it would make them see what happens when you litter even a little plastic bag. It would allow them to take charge for what they do and how they do it. So instead of throwing a water bottle on the ground they might think twice and throw it in the garbage or maybe even into the recycling bin.

So if we make community service needed then we would have a lot more teenagers and other people working on it. It would help our older citizens because instead of them lifting a box and falling down the stairs a teenager could do it and not get hurt at all. Also there would be not as much litter and pollution in the parks and rivers. One more big thing is that they would become responsible and not do as much stupid stuff as they are now. So these are my reasons why I think that community service should be needed in schools.
