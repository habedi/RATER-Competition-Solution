Can a computer recognize the subtke facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? This text is explaining how technology is identifying humans facial expressions and if it is valuable or not.

The use of technology to read emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuble because in the text it states, "Infact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Dr. Huang new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps his emotion algorithms are a different sort of "Da Vinci Code"! The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Based on all of this information, this is basicaly telling me all the benefits this new software computer can do. In my own personal opinion, I think it would be a great idea to have software like these to have at school. Ideas like this one could actually end up helping a very long way.

In conclusion, a software identifying human emotions is a great idea to bring into this world. Throughout all of the sadness, the happieness, and all of the aggressiveness, it could help people a long way.
