Thousands of people died because of texting and driving. Every day one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and around 1000 people are injured in some way in crashes by these irresponsible distracted drivers. One of the most dangerous activities that many people do is texting while driving. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the vehicle and could cause a crash, or even worse, could kill other people. When a person is texting she or he is thinking about other things besides concentrating on driving. This is very dangerous, because it could make the driver lose control of the car and slow her or his brain's reaction time in case of a potential accident.

One of the dangers of texting and driving at the same time is the attention it takes away from the road. A driver who is focused on looking at their phone is not paying enough attention to other cars or what is happening around them. Something as simple as an animal running out in front of their car can cause serious damage to the vehicle and cause the driver to swerve and potentially hit another car. Texting while driving is the act of composing, sending, or reading text messages, email, or making other similar use of the internet on a mobile device while operating. Just by looking on your phone you can easily get yourself killed or kill someone without paying attention.

For this reason, it is very important that we find some ideas to break off this bad habit of texting while driving. I think that one of the easiest and best ways to break this habit is simply to turn off your phone. In this case the driver wouldn't be distracted by the ringing of the phone and it wouldn't make the driver to text while driving. Another way to break this habit is to download some of the new applications that can disable cell phones while people are driving. Also, there are other applications that automatically send a text to whoever is texting the driver to tell that person that she or he is driving, and that the text will be answered later. There are a great variety of applications to choose I think that we can use these to help us with the problem of texting while we are driving so that you as the driver will not get hurt.

Something as important as your own life is more important than your own cell phone. People all over the world need to realize how much danger they are putting other people in when they pick up that phone. It is not just other people you are putting in danger, but also yourself. If for one second you paid more attention to the road then you probably wouldn't be in a situation where you're severely injured or possible killing someone. There should be a law for your phone being out while you are driving because this problem will possibly never stop and will continue harming innocents around the world.
