The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" does a good job supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers. The author uses interesting and good facts/ information regarding this topic.

The author tells us all the bad stuff about Venus that makes it "inhospitable" and says that it would be a very dangerous and risky mission. He tells us that humans can not handle the atmosphere of Venus. He gives us all the bad news and then lightens up and gives us the good news.

In the exerpt the author informs us that we can make it work if we float above the fray. The excerpt then tells us to imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Still, being so far above the surface the conditions are still not easy but they're survivable for humans.

Since we would have to hover over the surface, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. But to understand Venus we would have to be up close and personal despite the risks. The author tells us that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. NASA is also working on other approaches to studying Venus. They are looking into and testing different technology that can withstand the harshness of Venus's surface.

In the end the author concludes that "striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. I think the author did a good job on supporting his claim with good evidence and facts.
