In this story talks that mona lisa wants to invited a technology object thst can see people's emotions. And this is why mona lisa is trying to come up with technology object. But I disagree that she should not invited a technology object that can see peolpe's emotions. Someone people will say that they will feel worried that a technology object is see how their emotions feel like. Other thing is that people saying bad things to mona lisa that why she invited a technology object that allows to see emotions. And also mona lisa says that most people have trouble describing each of their facial trait. And also she wants to see if people are always happy or anger or their sad. And mona lisa thinks that it is good idea to come up with a technology object. She wants to see how people react to danger things in life. On the other their there is other doctor called Dr Huang that is trying to develop better ways to humans and computers and to communicate. And this doctor thinks that it is good idea to develop better ways for human people. But i also disagree with this doctor too. Because we can never changes people ways. We even can not make people's life make them in a better way. In conclusion I both disagree with this two people because we can never change develop people in better ways. Latest, is that we schould not invited a technology that we can see people's emotions. Because people will feel worried or get mad about inviting a technology object.
