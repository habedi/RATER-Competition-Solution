Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become an addiction to the human race. We as humans tend to use them for everything in our lives. People use their cell phone for communication, social media, alarms, schedules planning, etc. Often times people are so distracted by their cellular device that people use them at the wrong time. One of those wrong times are when people use their phone while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous for people to use their phone while driving.

There are a lot of issues that can come with using your phone while driving. Others lives are put into danger, fatal car crashes, accidents and using your phone shows that you are willing to risk your own personal safety. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging (teendriversource. org). "Statistics show that the use of a cell phone behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (teendriversource. org)."

Distractions from cell phones cause death rates to go up. Society has a bad addiction of being on their cell phones for long periods of time. This addiction is causing people to be distracted while driving. Many people have been in car accidents where people were brutally injured and some have had fatal accidents. Not only did the distracted driver hurt the opposing driver but the loved ones of the opposing drive goes through a lot. Their loved one might be hurt and need full time care or they may have to plan a funeral.

Situations like these should make us think about the actions we take. Society should pull away from their phones to save others lives and save heartbreak from others. Most adults think it is the teenagers that are causing the problems with distraction of cell phones. Adults are a big problem when it comes to being distracted with cell phones while driving. However, society should not accuse each other but we should work together on making a change in cell phone usage.

In conclusion, society should take time out and stop being selfish about using their phones while driving. People should stop trying to check their messages, read the latest tweet, or catch up on the latest post on instagram. Society should think about the safety of themselves and the safety of others. Waiting until your next destination to check your phone could help bring down the death rates of fatal car accidents. Our states have laws in place that demand that we don't text while driving. People have bought devices to hold their cell phone on their car dash but that doesn't help. The driver tends to look a the phone instead of the road. They especially look at the phone when making a video call. The purpose of driving is to arrive at our next destination safely. Face to face conversation should be practiced more and that could decrease the use of cellphones while driving. Everyone should stay safe and keep the world safer by focusing on the road and not our cellular device.
