in my thoughts i prefer policy one because well students are going to have their phones with them either way. if you go with policy 2 students would just rebel and use their phones when teachers aren't looking or around. The free time given to students such as lunch and passing periods are for their use if they want to text let them text if they want to study then so be it.

i, like most students prefer policy one because well some students don't have classes with their friends so if they don't see them during the passing period they could text them. people say use your time wisely and some students will. there's a time to learn and a time to socialize and free time could be a time to socialize. personally i think it may cut into time that could be used to study. hey its their life so if they prefer to socialize let them do that as long as they keep their grades up.

i mean do you prefer for a student to go to the restroom and text and be late or text on their way to class and get there on time. of course students will text when teachers aren't looking and why because we cant during our free time we have at school. i see people secretly texting at lunch all the time so if you put policy 1 students wont have the fear of getting their phones picked up by a teacher.

what if you need your mother to bring you something you forgot at home you cant tell her if you have policy 2 ,but if it were policy 1 you could tell her and she'll bring an d it'll all be fine. like once i forgot my shorts for athletics at home i was gonna text my mom during my passing period to bring them but i couldn't because i couldn't use my phone, so i had to bear crawl in athletics. So i prefer policy 1 over policy 2 for those reasons.
