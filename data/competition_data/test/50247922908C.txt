Dear Principle.

I do not agree with the new policy. I find it unfair that students with a grade C average are not allowed to compete in school sports. I think it should be up to their parents whether they should play or not. The school needs to know that getting a C average is normal. C stands for average, B is good, and A is Excellent. Sports are for exercise and they help you stay in shape. Some of the reason that we have obesity in America is because schools don't let kids that have bad grades play sports. In college your grade point average needs to be above a 2.0 to play sports. That is reasonable.

In middle school your grade really isn't getting recorded. Colleges do not look at your middle school grades. They actually don't start looking at your grades until high school. In high school they look at your grades and sports. In middle school they don't look at anything. There is no reason that we should not be allowed to compete in extra curricular activities. That is what colleges want to see. They want to see what you do out of school. They don't want a misbehaved late teenager coming to their school to disrupt class. Some kids are like that, they are very smart in school but they misbehave during class and get into trouble at home.

Sports also keep us out of trouble. Which would you rather us do, play video games, get fat, and do drugs, or would you rather have us stay in shape and be well behaved. I think you would rather have us be well behaved. Sports are fun, school is not. You wonder why it is so hard for us to concentrate and do well. Its because we are so pressured into doing well that it makes it no fun. Sports are fun because you get to relax and not worry about school for just a little while. We have way more school than sports, can't you give us a little freedom. It isn't like whenever we aren't playing sports we are studying or doing homework. We have extra time to play sports, why can't we use it?

Sincerely,
