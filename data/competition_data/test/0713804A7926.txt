Dear Principal:

Cell phones should be allowed to be kept in school at times.

They are a students way of keeping in touch with parents.

It is also good to be used in times of emergency.

However, it can also be bad because the use of it in inappropriate situations could cause a student to not pay attention in class.

Cell phones are a helpful way to keep in touch in difficult situations, but can also be distracting in class.

Cell phones are a necessity at times to have.

Especially with how much kids are up and about these days, they may be needed to contact parents as needed.

Also, in an emergency situation like, for example, a bad snowstorm, a cell phone could help students receive the message that their ride home may be a little late.

This way they aren't blindly walking around the neighborhood looking for their parents' car.

However, this good technology comes at a price.

Without being strongly reprimanded, students would be able to text in class.

Not only is it being rude to the teacher, but it is also hurting them.

Say the teacher assigns a project or a big test.

The student not paying attention will not do the assignment or fail the test.

Therefore, if students are allowed to bring cell phones to school, teachers have to be vigilant of the facts that they might be used in their class.

All in all, cell phones should be allowed to be kept in school.

They are necessary in a modern students life to keep in touch.

However, if not addressed thoroughly, students might be able to sneak them in class, and that could be really bad.

Moreover, Policy 1 should be passed to let students bring cell phones to school.
