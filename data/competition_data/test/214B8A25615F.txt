Dear Principal,

I am well aware about this idea to let kids bring cell phones to school and let them use them in free time, but I believe that kids should not be allowed to use them.

Kids need to be learning, not texting and talking to there friends. They do that enough out side of school. If they can do it any time during school, then they might as well do it the whole day because that's exactly what their going to do.

I believe that they should only be allowed to bring it in case of an emergency. While they are in school it should be turned off and in their locker. Kids spend so much time on the phone that it is becoming a habit. We need to break that habit, not encourage it. Letting them bring phones to school is only going to make it worse.

I hope you consider what i said. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

Your student,
