There are many reasons I think you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program. But I am going to tell you about some of my thoughts. I was just a small town boy when my friend brought up this proposal. I couldn't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. You get to go to Europe by cattle boat. You get to take care of people and animals. Who doesn't love animals? You get to bring them food.

These animals and humans have been through too much. It is the least we can do. During the trip I became old enough to go to the military, but the recruits saw what I was doing and they told me to stick to it. I was serving my country in my own way.

I also got to take multiple trips, so if you are really into it you get multiple chances to help others. I think I took around 9 trips. But it isn't all work and no fun I actually got to see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, go on gondola rides in Venice,Italy, explore an excavated castle in Crete, and I was astonished by the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have seen any of those places if I hadn't taken the risk and become a "Seagoing Cowboy." But don't get the wrong impression it was hard work, definitley. But it was worth it seeing people and animals treated the way they should be.

I also had some cowboys I got to pass time with. We would play baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. We had table-tennis tournaments, we would do fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other various games.

But being a cowboy taught me many lessons. How to not be greedy because there are those who are less fortunate then us. It taught me to take a risk, work as a team, succeed as a team. I gained awareness about the people from different countries and different races. I almost lost my life on one of those trips but I would have lost my life doing something I truly loved. So that is why I think you should become a "Seagoing Cowboy." So are you in for the long haul?
