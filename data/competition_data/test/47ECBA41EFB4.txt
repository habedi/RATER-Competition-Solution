In this story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,I go on a trip with my friend to Europe and get a once in a life time opportunity, to be a Seagoing Cowboy. In this essay I will be covincing you to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will talk about how you get to see the world, go site seeing, and get to have fun but also help your country.

First off, seeing the world. in the story I talked about how besides helping people I got to see the breath taking view of Europe and China but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was just beautiful. I also traveled across the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States. Now who wouldn't want to see the world like I did and still help people in need?

Next, site seeing. On my journey to help, I got to take a gondola ( a boat) ride in Venice, Italy a city with sreets of water. Wouldn't it be amazing to go on a gondola and to go explore Italy? Also,I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Is'nt that just amazing?

Last but not least, what is a Seagoing Cowboy? I can't persuade you to be one if I don't tell you what it is! A Seagoing Cowboy takes care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas . Don and I signed up. When we were Seagoing Cowboys it was 1945 when World War 2 was over in Europe. We helped countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you like helping people this would be a great job for you.

In conclusion, I hope I convinced you to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Now that I've told you about how you get to see the world, go site seeing, and what a Seagoing Cowboy is I hope I've helped you make up your mind. In the future, I hope more people will sign up and help better our would.
