Have you ever wondered how many kids would not be able to play sports if the principal said you must have at least a B average? That would be interesting.

Your principal is considering changing school policy so that students cant participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average. Many students in school who play sports have a C average, i would disagree with her because some of our best athletes have trouble keeping there grades up, students who dedicate there life to sports would probably switch schools, and people would complain.

First i would disagree with her because some of our best athletes have trouble keeping there grades up, boys in basketball, girls in basketball, soccer players, especially football players, and all the rest of the sports. Middle school is tough, yes we should try our best and some of us do and we still have a C average or lower. i wouldn't say a D or F average for sports but, at least a high C average.

Second, i disagree with her because some of our football and basketball players dedicate there life to there sports, and are really good at them! If our best football player is struggling with a C average, are you just going to shut him out of playing football? Then you know he's going to be upset and most likely switch schools if he can. SCHOOL_NAME doesn't need to loose any great kid, we have some of the best football players and need to keep them.

Last i disagree with her because people would complain, coaches, and parents. some of our coaches love there players absolutely love there players, and i' m sure that would be a big disappointment to loose them out on the field or court. Parents would complain im sure of because you should see some parents at the games, they really get into it! Sports really take control of some peoples life's and they become a part of you.

In conclusion i disagree with her because, some of our best athletes have trouble keeping there grades up, some of our football and basketball players dedicate there life to there sports, and also because people would complain.
