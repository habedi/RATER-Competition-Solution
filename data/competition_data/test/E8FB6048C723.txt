A life without cars sure sounds like a great idea for saving up less pollution and have less traffic jams, right? Well, that's a true fact, facing the reality that over the past few years we've had times and times again where we've polluted our own air over the repetetive over use of cars, specially because now-a-days there's way more cars being sold from car dealerships like Ford, Mercedes, Chevrolette, and etc. On the contrary, there's now been a few areas and cities in a few countries where there's been a shortage of using cars or none used at all. A life without cars can indeed help out so much more in many various occasions and issues like pollution, smog, and traffic.

Car-free cities are the best ways to improve in somewhat of a way for easier transportation and reduced air pollution. For example, as said from source 1, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, on the first paragraph, "VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up on cars." explains how this residence from the few in Germany have made it possible to be car-free. To add more, the author, Rosenthal, from this passage also explains that Vauban contains 5,500 residents making it the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life, in lines 4-7, pargraph 6. The main idea of this is that it's best to keeps cities, or even better whole countries car-free or low ratings of cars being used to help stop such as pollution and traffic jams.

Just like Vauban, Germany is car-free some other countries do their best as well to keep their cities and border safe from the damages and difficulties cars cause. As an example of this, source 2, "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, explains in paragraph 10, "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." As this clearly states, Paris has as well moved towards a much closer car-free city itself. Reason for this partial driving ban is because of smog caused by the pollution of cars, this explained on paragraph 17 on source 2 as the author, Duffer, says, "Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found." In comparison, soruce 3, "Car-Free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky, explains how Bogota, Colombia in has a car-free day for devoiding traffic jams. As a few perks that were gained from this car-free day, in pargraph 28, said are: "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."
