Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning. Students summer projects should be teacher-designed because it will be easier to gradeÂ and students are more likely to do it.

If students summer projects were teacher-designed then it will make grading easier. They wont have to change up their grading system because everyone will be doing the same one. The teacher will base all the projects off of the one that got an 100%. Also they will grade them faster. If students designed their own projects, the teacher would have to grade each one differently. Instead of the doing the same project and grading them the same. Teachers also have other things that they need to grade, so when all the students do the same project it makes it easy for them.

If students were allowed to design their own projects, they would be less likely to do them. One reason is that students would forget about them because it summer time and they have better things to do. Another reason is because some of them would wait last minute to do them and wouldnt have any time to do or finish them. When a teacher assigns work and gives you a due date for them, students will make sure they get it done. Its different when a teacher gives you a project and when you get to pick your projects. Students have a mindset where its more important when if a teacher tells you to do it, so that means they have to get it done. If students pick then it wouldnt be important because its what they want to do.

A reason why students shouldnt pick their own projects is because no students wants to do work over the summer. Giving students the option to pick their projects, theyre going to pick to forget it. Summer is the time that students dot have to worry about school work, grades, teacher, basically anything thats related to school. Some students dont even do projects the time that theyre in school, so theyre definitely not going to do it outside of school. Especially when they can be using that time to have fun and do what they want.

If teachers want students to do a summer project then they shouldnt pick it because students are not gonna do it. They would be more likely to do it just because teacher are picking, so they can continue learning during the summer.
