Did you ever thought about doing some of extracurricular activities after school and how they impact you and your community? Well,I agree that students must praticipate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's fun,it helps your community,and you can get service hours.

My first reason is fun. Do you know that feeling when you have nothing to do and then you get bored? Some activities like sport or things that you enjoy to do outside of the school are solution of this problem. If you really enjoy your activity,it will keep you away from being bored. Also,it is a great way to get some skills and improve yourself. On other hand,it is fun because of the other people. Imagine a student that never does activities outside of the school sits at home and does nothing and a student that communicates with many people and meets new people during the activity. I think that the person who has a extracurricular activity has more social skills that will be useful in the future and is never bored.

My second reason is,it helps community. For example,I have an activity outside of the school. It is Russian scouts. We meet up at church in Washington D.C and we talk about how we can help our community and environment. Sometimes we pick up the trash or give away food for homeless and people who needs it. Sometimes we visit old people and help them. Also,we donate some of our collected money for many things. So,I think it's a very good way to help your community by doing kind things like that. Activities like that make a really great impact on you and your community.

My third reason is service hours. All teenagers understand how it is important. For example,if you do extracurricular activity like serve on the student council or like me,be in organization that helps community you can get service hours. They are really important for high school and college. This is why activities like these may help you a lot. I have an expirience of getting eight service hours by helping my Unity time teacher Mrs. Generic_Name with decoration of the Snow Ball dance after school and also I got 6 service hours by helping Russian Scouts with Russian Festival in Washington D.C.

In conclusion,I think extracurricular activities do impact you and your community in a good way. That's why I agree that students must praticipate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's fun,it helps your community,and you can get service hours. What are some impacts of your activities? Do you think extracurricular activities are something that student must do?
