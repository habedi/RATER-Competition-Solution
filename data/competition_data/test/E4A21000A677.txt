Do you believe in aliens? Some people say to have evidence and proof that aliens are real. Today I will talk about a particular piece of evidence people are said to have, ''The Face on Mars.''

''The Face on Mars'' is a natural landform found on mars that resembles a human head, but people belive it's an alien landmark. ''The Face on Mars'' is a landform and not an alien because, in the images in the beginning it looks like a head but as technology developed over time and they were able to get clearer pictures it looks more like a landform.

''The Face on Mars is a landform. I say this because if you look at the beginning pictures it looks like a human face, but towards the end it starts to look more like a landform. In the middle of the article it starts to talk about how in the beginning it look liked a face, but the article states, ''April fifth nineteen ninety eight when Mars Globlal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the orginal Viking photos. ''That is proof that back then their cameras weren't as developed and that in nineteen ninety eight there technolgy wasn't perfect, but able to get clearer pictures to prove it was a landform.

In conclusion, ''The Face on Mars'' is a landform and not an alien landmark because in the images you can see at the beginning it may have looked like a face but towards the end of the pictures it looks more like a landform than a face. When you look at the pictures, I believe that in the beginning I would have believe it was an alien landmark because it does look ike a face. As we see in the pictures it does start to look more like a landform because there technolgy develops so they can get a more clearer picture.
