dear principal,

I think that students should be able to play sports and do activities without having to have a B average. i say this because many students don't have a B average. So many students wouldn't be able to play sports and we would hardly have any sports teams. not to mention students wouldn't be able to get the strength and exercise that they need.

To begin with, many students don't have a B average. For some people it is hard to achieve. For example my school has about a C average. therefore my school would not be able to play school sports and do school activities as often as they should. according to SCHOOL_NAME right now 89 percent of schools are allowed to play sports and do activities with at least a C average at the moment. our students should have to work harder than they should have to just to play a sport and i don't think that's fair.

Additionally, if every one had to have a B average just to play sports then our school would hardly have any SCHOOL_NAME teams. if we don't have any teams then we cant verse any other schools and that would make us very unexciting. our students would not be able to enjoy the excitement of getting team uniforms and have school rivalry's. we also wouldn't be able to interact with other schools. like one time i met my best friend through out a volleyball game and she didn't even go to my school. she was from SCHOOL_NAME and was on the other team.

Also, when your playing sports or doing activities you getting tons of exercise. this is another good reason why TEACHER_NAME should definitely not consider only allowing B average students to play in sports and activities. According to health magazine, 74 percent of kids are overweight due to no exercise and lack of agility. This idea would just add to the percent... do you want this for your students?

In conclusion, i once again say that i believe that you should allow students with a C average to play sports and be involved in activities. as mentioned before, most of the students in my school don't have a B average, not many schools do. Do you really not want SCHOOL_NAMEto not have any school teams. and do you want your students to be healthy? and to not to be able to interact with other schools. well if not , please consider not going along with your plans.

S

incerely, student.
