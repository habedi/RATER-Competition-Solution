If some schools require students to do summer projects over their break, how can one insure that students will complete it if it were designed by a teacher? Students never want to do work over the summer, but if its a requirement it should at least be something that intrigues them. If the project is teacher-designed many students probably wouldnt like the assignment that the teacher assigns them over their break. which leads to a possibility of many students not doing the project at all. Students dont want to have a project that'll be confusing and time consuming to them. They would rather have something that can be productive and fun. A student-designed project allows for: students to be more interested in their project, to have a project designed by students will be more intriguing, and students can work together creatively to create something that'll help them to continue learning over the summer.

Many students like doing things that interest them, it makes them enjoy what they're working on. If the summer project is student-designed. It will be something that they create, not something that a teacher made up and gave to their students to give them a hard time over break. It's indeed a way for them to learn but its not how a student would want to learn. Students want to learn during their break with something that doesn't bore them. They want something that can keep them entertained and want them to keep learning. overall a student learns better when they're fully committed to it and want to put their focus on, especially if its designed by them.

Almost all teachers know that students enjoy working together, students are very creative and intelligent, thats why having them design a project like this strengthens the reasoning behind why these summer projects should be student-designed as compared to being teacher-designed. Does one really believe that students enjoy doing projects that are designed by a teacher, no, students enjoy doing things their way, something that can relate to them and understand a lot better. For example, a student would prefer working together with other students to create something fun for them to do over their time off, as opposed to being restricted to do work over summer by ones teacher, with boring ways of learning; therefore, leaving students demoralized. Students always perform well when on topic and working together, if a students can come up with something creative together. It'll make them feel comfortable with completing this summer project; furthermore, allowing them to continue learning through a unique, fun, and creative assignment.

In conclusion, a student-designed project would: intrigue students, make them more interested in it, and it allows them to work together. Having students design a project for them to do over the summer would increase student productivity over their time off. Therefore enabling that student to continue learning and maintaining their intellect. Most teachers try to relate to students but they cant, having a teacher-designed project wouldnt be as a effective as having one designed by a student. The amount of creativity that a student has in ones mind is overwhelming. Students work best with others and together they can create enjoyable tasks for themselves. The probability of a student doing a student-designed project is much higher as compared to a teacher-designed project. Summer projects will be more enjoyable and interesting if it were designed by students instead of teachers.
