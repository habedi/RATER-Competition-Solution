Dear Principle,

The two policies you are having to choose from are very negotiable. Having no cell phones at all at school probably would not go over very well. I think that will not stop students from bringing them, and will just influence them to using them in secrecy. This policy will bring more on you, by having to punish the kids that are bringing them to school anyway. Most students break this rule as it is. There is no harm in having cellular devices on school property, unless there is misuse of them, or they are distracting the class from learning.

My opinion is that we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school, and use them during free time, lunch, or passing periods. During these times we are not supervised by s teacher, or are distracting anyone from the school regulations. Plus, it would be very helpful if you have an emergency, or need to get a-hold of someone for a ride or anything worth needing contact. You could have a rule that if your phone is not turned off during class, than you may serve a detention and get your phone taken away for the rest of school.

I see my teachers on their phone constantly. They occasionally have it turned off during class, but every once and a while it will disrupt our class. If it is their job to be here and they have their phones on, then why cant we? Teachers nor students should have their phones during class, or while learning. You must keep the rules mutual.

Phones are a minor speed bump during our school day. We should not let it become a big deal, and just keep the use at a minimum. I believe you should make the rules that you may only turn your cell phones on during passing periods, lunch, or free time. Any down time of your day is acceptable. Other than that there will be consequences. This new policy will sound fair to everyone and will keep the commotion down. Students will respect that you let them use it then, let alone at all. They will most likely follow the rules. This is the best way you should go to have a fair school day. Keep your options in mind.

Sincerely,
