A start to a new beginning. Last summer a group of friends and I, started a summer program. A program where kids can learn different things, different ways to do things, and of course have fun. We built things such as, wooden boats, wooden hats, and wooden cars. We showed them different ways to do project. For fun we took the kids swimming, hiking, and fishing. At the end my friends and I got great feedback from the kids and their parents. With my friends and I taking on such as big program like that, showed me that any child could do whatever they wanted to, if they put their mind to it. That is why I think it is a great idea for students to design; because, they could come up with fun things to do, could be able to show others what they are able to do without a teacher's help, and they would already know what people their age like to talk about and work on.

First, most students have great imaginations. That can cause them to come up with great, fun, and different things to do. Such as using 3D objects, using liquids, and maybe even using things from nature. Those different things can really get someone attention.

Second, there may be someone that is trying their best to show everyone what they can do. Designing a project can be great way to prove themselves. That way when they finish designing, they are able to show everyone. That student would be able to call themselves a great independent worker.

Third, when students are let out for the summer; they do not want to do thing involving school work. Having a student design the project can make sure it is on something that would make them want to work on something related to school. It will be something different for the kids. They will be doing something instructive, as their summer goes by.

In conclusion, student designed would be the best choice. Some people might say teacher design would be best but I disagree. I beg you to consider my opinion.
