The Face is on Mars, Im a Scientist at NASA and, I can tell you that the Face is no Alien artifact. It is a landform of its own just like our Earth makes its own landforms like lakes, rivers, hills, ect. This Face had became a big pop icon. It started in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio and even talk shows. Some people think the Face is bona find evidence of life on Mars.

"Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This illusion is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. The so called "face" is not a face it is not a alien monument artifact at all this is just made by the plant.

Some scientists beliveved the Face was an alien artifact. Latter of they founded out that it was not. When up an took a better photoghraph of the "face". What the picture actuallshws is the Martian equivalant of a butte or mesa-landforms. The landform is just a landfor nothing special to it at all. The "face" is just an illusion.
