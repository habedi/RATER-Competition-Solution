Dear Principle,

I have been made aware of the fact that you are trying to decide whether or not to require all students to perform community service. As a Catholic eighth grade student who has done her share of community service, I believe that everyone should participate in this friendly gesture. Here are some reasons on why I believe this: kids will see that helping the community can impact their lives greatly, people will be more open to helping our school because we have helped them, and lastly kids will see that community service makes you a more caring person and they will feel better about themselves.

If our school decides to enforce the requirement of having everyone perform community service more things will be able to get done. Think about it, every single kid in our school helping out their community will make us able to perform more complex tasks because we will have such a large number helping out. Once people see how much our school cares about the community they will want to help us with our school programs, donations etc. They will feel like it is their job to give back to us since we helped them. Participating in community service is very important if you ever want things to get done in your own community. For an example, if you think that your community is not doing a good enough job at cleaning the streets after a snow storm, then you need to become involved and help out with that problem or else it may never get done the way you want it to.

I know that when I completed my community service projects I felt like I had really made a difference in my community. I didn't do extreme changes, but by just taking time and cleaning up the soccer fields and going to the local soup kitchen I knew I made a difference. It made me feel really good about myself and ever since then whenever I get the opportunity to help out, I act on it. I know that our students will want to do the same because you cannot deny the feeling of feeling good about yourself.

Sincerely,
