dear principle, helping your c community is very important. we need play our role by helping the elderly because maybe they need assistance. help or tutor kids in their homework at the community center because sometimes they have trouble solving some problems. you can also organize a community clean up so it could be a polluted free area.

living a clean , garbage free area is very important. some people just liter because they are to lazy to throw their trash in their trash cans. some people even let their babies walk outside their side walk, filled with bacteria and trash. little kids are tempted to eat the trash and sometimes end up indigested the trash. if we do a team were we pick up the trash once a month , mother nature could be proud of us. also by cleaning our community we make people happy, and we can live in a healthy and friendly community.

kids need help with their home work every time. sometime parents do not have time to help their kids because they are busy .if we do a homework help club, we could help these children be smarter so they could succeed and achieve in life. also we can save their parents time in their work and have time to play with their son or daughter.

the elderly sometimes need assistance or are lonely because nobody come and visit them.

sometimes old people feel lonely because either they were abandoned by their families or their are just one person. if we visit them once in a while, we could play a game with them or read a story with them, they cold be happy and enjoy they have company.

once we do does task then everybody would be happy. we should help each other hand in hand . with our good deeds and actions we could live in a blessed community. we need to enjoy life and helping others.
