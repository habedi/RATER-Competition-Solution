The principal of my school has said that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. I think that this requirement is wrong and I disagree with it. There are many reasons why I think this is a bad idea. One big reason is many students do not have someone to take and pick them up after these extra curricular activities. Two other reasons are that it could take away from academics and some students could not afford activities that cost more money.

My first reason for disagreeing with this rule is that some students don't have transportation. For one thing there are buses that pick these students up and take them to school and buses that bring them home after the school day but there are no buses to bring them home after leaving an extra curricular activity after school. I believe that there being no buses is something that hinders many students from participating in after school activities. Because there are no evening buses, students that want to do an after school activity have to be picked up by their parents who may not have time to pick them up because of their work schedule. If a student truly wanted to do an after school activity but their parents couldn't pick them up they could walk home, but for some that would be to far to walk.

I also believe that this as a rule can take away from student academics. This rule is not agreeing with a rule that I have heard from administrators and coaches. That rule is that if you are failing any classes for a certain amount of time you are off the team. Those two rules conflict each other, also a student who may have trouble in school can be subject to much more trouble in school by being forced to do an extra curricular activity. Some students that want to do better and do extra work to get better in subjects and do better in subjects will be hindered by this rule and have less time to get better in their areas of weakness.

My final reason is the money factor. Certain extra curricular activities are free and some cost money. The sad truth is that some students can not afford to do an extra curricular activity that costs money due to their family's economic situation. If a student wants to do an activity that costs money but can not afford to this rule will force them to have to do another activity and some students will feel like they were forced to do their activity because they are poor and that is a bad look for a school and a bad feeling for a student. so economically this rule would be unfair.

To end this essay I will say that I think forcing student to do extra curricular activities is wrong. Doing this can force students to have to walk home or force parents to change their work schedule. Also this rule will conflict with other rules and take away from student academics. Finally, this rule is unfair to the economically challenged. The last I have to say is that I believe this rule is wrong, obnoxious and unfair to students.
