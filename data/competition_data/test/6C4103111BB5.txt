In emtions there are different ways you can tell if a person is happy or sad but you have you ever thought you could be everyone of them at once. I feel like you cant know for certian what people are feeling becasue people only know what they truly feel. There are ways you cant tell for examples by there facial muscles. You can tell the differenece from a real smile or a fake smile. For a guniene smile you will seee that the cheeck bones lift up the corner of your mouth. If its a fake smile your face streaches sideways. You can also tell by taking a test of a computer. You can immaute other peoples emotions. For example if your showing empthly for someone. I feel like a person can feel a lot of different emotions and that may not be the true one but you can try to figure it out by doing these things. It has helped me learn how to figure of people emotions better and especially when you take a pic with them.
