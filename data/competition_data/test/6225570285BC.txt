To me students should be required to do community service. It would be good for some people to learn the work ethic so they can use it later in life. The most important reason students should be required to do that is that they might be trouble makers. Trouble makers need to learn to do something good for their life. Some bad people have to community service to make them learn. Some people might not learn and keep doing what they were doing before like getting in trouble. If there was a perfect student that has good grades and doesn't get in trouble I still think that they should do community service. If they know how to work then they'll probably use that knowledge and go to college and might do some good for the community. I'm not just saying students should do it. Take some time to think for all adults to do it. Some adults may have not learned a good work ethic as a kid, but they can learn it as an adult. Tutoring is a very good thing to do. Some kids might not be as fast as a learner than you are. You can try to get that child to be on the same level as you. I just think that a couple of elementary kids should be tutored. I say that, because if you have every single older kid teaching little kids the little kid wouldn't learn a thing just by having someone helping them with their homework. You could also shovel snow in the winter for you community. For example, when I'm watching the news it shows that a major amount of elderly people have heart attacks, because of shoveling snow. Every little thing that you do can help a majority of your community. Sports is a great example of community service. I see NFL football players on TV about NFL play 60. They are helping kids 15-20 years younger than them. Also in the instructions it says that some kids say it takes up time. I think that it is well worth their time. You can easily make a good reputation of yourself for helping some people. I'm not saying to use up all your free time to help people. If your outside riding bikes with your friends or something and you see a person drop garbage or something, you can easily pick it up and throw it away for them. Like I said small actions can turn into big good or bad things. Community service does not just mean helping out your neighborhood it also means helping out your town or city. To me some people that you work with might go around town to people and tell them about you, and they will probably respect you. There are so many pro and cons about this. Right now I'm just thinking about the cons. There are probably less cons than there is pros. I'll tell you that on con about this is that people would think that you are a suck up to your town. To me, who cares what people think about you. All you have to worry about is yourself and how you act.
