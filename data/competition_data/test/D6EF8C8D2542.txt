Should students have to participate in extracurricular activities? I believe extra curricular activies should be required in schools. Extracurricular activities have been proven to benefit students in many different ways. I believe students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will meet new people, discover new interest, and participate in some friendly competition.

First, students can meet new people if they were to do extracurricular activites. If students were in an extracurricular activity then students could see things from other student's perspectives. Seeing things from other student's perspectives might influence students to think differently about something or might let students see something in a way they never had before. Also, if students were to partcipate in extrcurricular activites students could make new friends which improves their social skills. Heightened social skills could help students later in life with things like job interviews, applying for college, and maybe even finding that "special someone". Maybe, if students were to meet new people, students could find things that they enjoy about someone else and try to apply that to themselves. For example, maybe someone is filled with charm and they love that about them, so they try to be more charming.

Next, students could discover new interest. It is possible that students could find something that they had no idea intrested them. Finding new things about yourself is very beneficial when trying to look for something new. The world would be a very dull place if everyone always did the same thing over and over again. Therefore, students should step out of their comfort zone and try something new every once and a while. Trying out new things might even help students see people and the world differently. Students could learn things about the world that they never thought possible.

Lastly, extracurricular activies could promote students to paricipate in friendly competition. A little friendly competition can strive students to do their best. When students give it their all, they usually feel proud about how much effort they put in. For instance, if students do their best, students will feel motivated to work harder and push their limits. Students may set new goals to be the best that they could possibly be. Also, everyone wants to win but friendly competition can teach students that it is okay not to win everytime, which can improve sportmanship.

In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because students will improve multiple skills, they can learn more about themsleves, and students can learn to work well with others. Another point is that, many students do not participate in extra curricular activities. I believe there are multiple reasons why students do not participate, but I think because they take time out of the day and students believe they will not be interesting and that they will not enjoy them are the biggest factors. Therefore, if students are obligated to participate they might change their mind and join more activities as the years go on.
