TEACHER_NAME,

I feel community service should be required.

Community service is required at the high school so why not start now?

Giving back to the community looks and is great on college applications, and community service can help decide what kids want to do in life.

Also, by performing community service kids can turn into model citizens.

SCHOOL_NAME requires their students to get so many community service hours to graduate.

Well, when some kids go to high school they have no experience in this area.

By making community service a requirement, students will get a head start on a way to prepare for their future. Also, this can mold students into model citizens.

Colleges are always looking for extra clubs and acclivities on applications.

Community service is a great thing on college applications.

Giving back helps colleges decide if they want you as part of their community or not.

If you have a long history of community service colleges will appreciate it more!

People are always saying that they want to be the president, or a professional sports star.

Some community service involves things like tutoring and coaching little league baseball, so you get to do what you love and give back.

Take me for example, my community service was coaching boys and girls club volleyball.

I loved what i was doing and I gave back.

TEACHER_NAME, helping the community is a great way to prepare for high school, contribute to kids college applications, and to do what you love but at the same time giving back . Please, require community service.

Isn't turning kids into model citizens a goal of any administrators?

Let kids give back to the community! to make a better future for everyone.
