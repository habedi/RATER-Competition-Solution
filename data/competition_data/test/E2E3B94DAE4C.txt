Dear TEACHER_NAME, concerning the school policy change to having a B grade average to be able to play sports, I would like to express my opinion. If you change the policy, will have less people on the sports teams because they have a C average. Yes you may think this will make the students work harder. It will actually make most of them drop out . The reason they maintain a CY average is to play sports. Maybe that's all they have to look for in the future. Also the sports like foot ball keep the kids from using any illegal substances, Because the have to stay healthy t play sports.

What if they were going to get scouted for high school soot ball teams, And you stopped them from playing because they didn't have a B average? What if that ruined his chances of going to a good high school that they liked?

What if they aren't capable of getting a B average, because of something like dyslexia? Your not going to let them play sports because the have a disability? Think about how life in school would be for the children without sports. It would be very feeble. people would try less harder. Some might change schools, or even not show up!

Please take what I have written into consideration.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
