For example, some simplifed eclctronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers exiting in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronis at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to tablet to acid or heat capabel of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our tavels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

It still important in those day , learning about Venus and what is near by our human world .So, we should keep learn about NASA.
