School is over and summer time is finally here. For some students it is the only time they have to feel free. Some schools often feel the need to give work to students during the summer. The work they give students can at times be a little boring. Teacher and students always have this arguments about who should make are summer projects ,should the teachers or the student make them .Many feel as if the teachers should make it because they are more experienced,but I on the other hand feel as if students should able to make their on projects. By students making their own summer projects it lets them show what they've learned. It will also promote more students to actually do their summer projects..Summer projects also show the next set of teachers know what they need to expand on more. The summer projects were made for students to get a chance to develop and grow over the summer.

Students making their own projects would be a great idea. At the end of every school year students should come out knowing more than they did in the beginning. Moving forward to the next grade students should be able to show what they've learned and know. The summer projects are a great way for students to better develop what they've already learned. Students don't do the work just to do it they do it to learn . When students can show you what they've learned it means the actually know it. Some may say if they only show what they know how are they expanding their knowledge, if they show what they know they end up getting better and better eventually you will be able to branch off to do bigger and better things. It's just like cooking if you do it over and over you'll get better at it and eventually you will be able to branch off. The summer time is a great time for you to expand your learning , you could come back and show your teachers what you've learned. There are so many games and sites that can help you develop .

When students are able make their own projects they can make it however they want. If students make their own project they can actually make it fun. Which can promote them to actually do the work. The summer project that the school assigns can get pretty boring. For teens you have to have something that grabs their attention. If they aren't excited about it they aren't going to try their best. Some students have short attention spans .When students are able to create something they really want to do they put their all in it. Students always wants things that are exciting and fun. It also has to be something that they are passionate about. You can't expect them to do something if they don't like it . A student is not going to do something if they dont like it . Some people say that if they make the project they aren't going to do anything because they are going to be playing all the time,students can control themselves when it comes to something when it come to something they really like.

The summer projects were created so students wouldn't forget what they learned .Some students end up forgetting what the learned. So the summer project are a great way to show the next set of teachers know what they need to expand on more. Coming from a long break and then trying to go back to learning is kind of hard. It's only hard because some students forget what they learned or either taught themselves. When they come back from the break the teachers can go over the projects to see what parts they struggled on. Teachers don't always give students a refresher. Some students need a reminder when they come back from a long break .You may need a reminder in a certain subject because it all connects .For instance in math you take all these maths and some how they all connect. You need a refresher for the last subject so you can succeed in the next part. Learning may be hard for some people ,but if you have that one teacher that ca refresh what you've learned everything will be better.

Your always learning there is no way around it. The little things you do can make a difference .Students are given special things like projects to help expand their learning. These projects are students ways of showing people that they know what they are doing and that they learned something. These things were created by the school now its time for the students to take control.
