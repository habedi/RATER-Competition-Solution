If I was asked to go for driverless cars or against it, I would be against it. Yes I know we're at the point when technology is used for everything, but I believe that the use of technology can be harmful to us. I'll give you four reasons why I am against driverless cars. It will affect our skills about cars, how it's function. Second, teenagers or anyone won't learn how to drive. Third, it might be dangerous because of the weather. Fourth, the driving laws can be changed.

If we had driverless cars, how are we going to learn or know about them? We can't always learn from technology. There is going to be new engines and everything, but I bet we can't learn about it that quickly. It took more than 60 years to understand this cars. We cant just throw all that away.

How are we going to teach teenagers how to drive if we have driverless cars? We won't be teaching them nothing, except to just put itself to drive. I bet teenagers want to learn how to drive on their own or from their parents, without the use of technology.
