Dear Principal,

The first reason that would make this a terrible idea is the fact that a C average is the main grade in all schools around the country for eligibility. The other reasons are: how bad do you want the school to look when the sports teams do not have any of it's good players. The other fact is that it would be unfair to the students for you to make some type of sudden change like that when being eligible for a C average was the old rule. Kids would freak out and people probably will not support your new school policy as I am now. This could really start a huge issue against your self and it might even back fire and not work at all, I do not recommend trying this.

I would not agree with your new policy, you should not carry this out it will hurt many students and you may even lose kids from the school that sports means their life to them. So, please take my thoughts into consideration so you do not make a bad decision that may get you not wanted back as principal for next year. Also, if you are going to make this decision at least add it in the student hand book before the year starts so you do not throw everyone off. You will ruin the kids entire year if you do this new school policy. Parents will be raving about it and students will talk about you badly and dislike you greatly.

The only good part about this policy is that it will drive students in their academics to make the extra grades to be able to play on the sports teams. The students will have to become more dedicated mentally than they have ever been before. Your school will get attention by all of the hard work that the students have displayed to pull up the average higher, this could lead to other schools following your policies as well to see how their students do. This is better for the students long term affect, so that they can have better work ethics and maybe keep using them throughout their lives.

Do whatever you think is necessary and should be carried out, but make sure you watch very closely to all of the students to see how they are reacting and if they are doing more well or worse. If your students are doing worse, then I would recommend you to talk to the teachers so that they can try to reach out to the kids more to help them make the grade that is necessary for eligibility. You have good ideas, but just be careful and do not make any mistakes you might regret. Read other students letters to get more opinions about the topic, do your research, and make your decision wisely. I'm sure you will make the correct analysis as to what should be done and what should not be messed with. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope it makes a change and fills your mind with the ideas of a fellow student.
