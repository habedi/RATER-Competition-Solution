In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. Because of the many uses of this innovative software, it is evident that FACS would be valuable technology to use with students in a classroom.

As we walk further into the world of more and more technology, a large majority of schools across the United States are beginning to use iPads, Chromebooks, and laptops for their everyday schooling. Textbooks are online, lesson videos are posted to Youtube, and practice games are played on apps. Students are relying more on technology than ever before. Because of this, FACS would be beneficial in the learning of students. For example, the passage states, '''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, ''' (D'Alto, Paragraph 6). If technology could save teachers time from teaching material students already know, and if a computer could efficiently determine the needs of students, this generation of kids could excell in a much greater degree than it currently is.

Another great benefit of FACS is that it would be able to sort and filter material based on your emotions to previous content. The computer software is able to detect six different emotions in addition to being able to tell if your emotions are forced or truthful. Each muscle in your face helps to show your emotion. FACS can determine which muscles were used to make your expression and therefore differentiate between real and fake emotions (D'Alto, Paragraphs 7-8). In the classroom, teachers spend hours preparing lesson plans which sometimes include videos and games. If FACS could determine the teachers emotions to the different videos and games, it could sort additional videos and quickly find content that the teacher likes and can use for his or her class. This can clearly be done because the author states, "For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different," (D'Alto, Paragraph 6).

In addition, FACS could detect the emotions of students after watching lesson videos or playing class games to show their reactions to the content or even to show if they understand the material or are confused.

Now is a time where technology is growing and taking over places such as schools. It is important that teachers and students are provided with the best possible ways to teach and learn in order to ensure that the next generation of doctors, engineers, and CEOs is ready for whatever comes its way. Facial Action Coding System is clearly a piece of technology that will change the way classrooms work and will benefit students and teachers alike in the goal to train kids for generations to come. It helps teachers save time spent teaching material kids already know as well as sorting out content based merely on the emotions of the face. Finally, it provides a way for teachers to recognize confused students in an attempt to create the most efficient classrooms in which students can learn.
