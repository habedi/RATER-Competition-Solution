"When the car of destiny was released it was a bomb, and all the critics said that the G was done. The sun had set and the chapter had closed but one thing they did not know about was the G would rise again just like the pheonix, the G will rise again."- Tenacious G

With a strong upcoming of the future, many car company have been working on cars that can help the economy grow into a huge future. Google being one of the biggest company's to make a car that can do this. This is my opinion about it.

As of right now the driverless car is still needed to be worked on. It can only go 25 miles per hour and still need humans to be aware of what is going on. If a human is not paying attention there will be an accident waiting to happen. I believe driverless cars should not be illegal in any state and I think this will greatly help towards the future. I understand the pros and cons of this and I think there are more pros to this than cons. So I think we really should allow this to happen but not to take over the full car game.

Google is a big enough industry to fund something like this. But a lot of states illegalized it but we all know the country is known for making things that shouldn't be illegal illegal. I hope Google continues to fight the system and get stronger so this could be something new. I believe that Google can fight back and push for this to happen.
