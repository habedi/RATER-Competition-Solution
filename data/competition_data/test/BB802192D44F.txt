There are some individuals who attend school everyday and do not apply themselves, now imagine if it was summer time and they were given the task to design a project for themselves. When the next school year begins it would be a lot of zeros that would have to be put in! With teachers creating a summer project it allows students to not only use creativity but it gives them motivation and challenge as well. Normally when teachers create assignments they put a lot of thought into it so that the student would have to think and be really creative. The goals of the projects during the summer are: to keep the students brain stimulating, for them to put the knowledge that they have gained the previous year to use, and to also prepare them for what could be coming the next year. Teachers should create the summer projects because it gives students a challenge, prevents them from getting distracted, and requires them to retain knowledge rather than plagiarizing.

Have you ever done an eight thousand piece puzzle? well, some teacher given projects are just like that. When people do puzzles it requires concentration, motivation, and interest. If students were to create their own project it is possible that he/she would not be as motivated or interested in it. If he/she isn't interested in it it's possible that he will/she will take the easy way out. Like puzzles, projects can be challenging and requires out of the box thinking. With teacher given projects students brains are still being stimulated and they are getting in a from of studying as well. Not only would the project be challenging the student to put forth their best work it would also be allowing them to get extra research in on the topic especially if they are interested in it.

When they do their research they get to analyze information that they may not have known about before. With gaining more knowledge than they left the previous school year with they are entering another school year with more new and fresh knowledge as well.

Summer time is the time that students take to relax and to hang out with their friends. If they had to create a project over the summer it is very likely that they would not get it done. During the summer a lot of students do not like or want to stay focus, that is usually the time when their brains shut down. With the project being created by a student it is possible that they will just choose a topic without having any knowledge on it, without even doing research on it or having interest in it, therefore it would be pointless because they would not be learning anything nor would they be maintaining information that has been taught to them previously. Usually friends help motivate their friends to do positive things but it is not often that you see the students motivating other students to get their work done. It is more likely to see students motivating each other to practice for a sport or to make bad decision but it still is not likely to see a student motivating another student to do a self made project over the summer therefore, teachers should design them. For instance, Last summer Generic_Name and Generic_Name were assigned a project by Mrs. Generic_Name, Generic_Name didn't want to do the project because she said it was summer time and it was time for fun. The project that Mrs. Generic_Name gave really caught Generic_Name eyes, Generic_Name really enjoyed Mrs. Generic_Name class so Generic_Name couldn't wait to get started. Once Generic_Name saw how interested that Generic_Name was she immediately changed her mind and wanted to do Mrs. Generic_Name project immediately. Generic_Name influenced Generic_Name to do her project all by him enjoying Mrs. Generic_Name's class. There are many positive things that teachers can do or say that can affect if a student does the over the summer project or not.

Throughout the school year teachers give out a variety of classwork, test and quiz grades and there are students who show up to school approximately two days out of the week and still receive an one hundred on the work, how is that someone may say? Although it may not be everyone doing this there are some students who cheat off of other students or use Google to find the answers. With students creating their own project it is extremely likely that they will not come up with their own work, however it is likely that they will use a little creativity if the project is designed by a teacher. There are also some students who would not do the summer projects because they aren't motivated, if the teacher put a prize for the best project it could give students more motivation and make them want to do the best project that they can possible do. When students are cheating and plagiarizing they don't really read and understand what they are putting on their projects, typically they just write what they see and read without understanding. With teacher given projects they are different every timeÂ which is good because it prevents the students from going and attempting to find an old project that belongs to someone else that is the same way. The method that the teachers use for the summer project should be different every time.

In conclusion, i agree that teachers should design the summer time projects because it challenges the students by giving them a task and requiring them to be an out of the box thinker. Also because it motivates them to gather the best information and as much information as possible. It helps them keep old knowledge fresh and gather new knowledge as well to add to the things that they already know. With the teachers designing the project it is better because it makes the project a priority for the students to get done which also teaches them responsibility. There are a variety of lessons that could come from teachers designing the summer projects for the students which could lead to many positive outcomes. Summer projects are really afftective in many ways but they have better outcomes when they are designed and influenced by a teacher.
