Dear Principle,

Policy 1, giving rights to students to use their phones during their free time, is a better choice to choose since it makes the students more comfortable, make them feel more open-minded in school, and it can even help students in their education by having a source to help them with assignments

First, it will be more comfortable for the students. Most schools are big, which is why some students lose their ways during first week of school. If you wanted to meet a friend during a free time or at lunch and you can't find them, what's a better way to find them than calling or texting them? Also, if you don't know where a new class is located, why struggle finding your way when you can text and ask your friend?

Secondly, students will feel more open-minded than before. If you ask an average student, whether they like going to school, most of them, honestly, will say no. Now we can't change that answer since school's purpose is to educate the students and the students tend to not like it. However, we can improve the image of the school for the students. If we open the rights to use cell phones during their free time, they will feel way more open-minded than before. This is important because if a student hates going to school and has a closed-mind about it, it will give tons of stress to that student and may effect his/hers educational career.

Thirdly, a portable source for the students. Nowadays, most students have some kind of smart phones or maybe just a regular cell phone that has a connection to a web or dictionary. Now imagine you were doing your homework during your free time and you don't know what a word means. Usually, if the right of using a cell phone was not opened, you would have to go to the library and check the dictionary. Now let's say that you had to research a certain topic. You would have to go to a computer in the library or someplace to do that. However, what if the all the computers were used by others. You would have to wait for a while to go on the web. If all these examples were changed to having the right to use the cell phones, you wouldn't have to worry about wasting time because you can do all of these at that exact moment and spot.

By reading all of these reasons, I hope you'll choose the policy that's the better for the students.

Sincerely, a student
