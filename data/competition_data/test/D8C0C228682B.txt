Texting While Driving While there are many causes of deaths in the United States, a huge epidemic that concerns officials more and more is the amount of deaths occurring because of texting while driving. Texting and driving can kill in split second just the amount of time it takes to send a "quick" text message. Texting and driving is known to the world as one of the most dangerous things to do while on the road. Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but also much more dangerous to the people and cars surrounding that particular individual.

According to many people texting and driving is similar if not identical to that of drunk driving. For example texting and driving physically and mentally impairs you to drive straight down a road, without causing a danger to people. As a whole population, we need to stop the use of texting and driving whether it's putting laws in place or designing a program that shuts off the use of texting the moment you step foot in the car.

The effects of texting while driving also can cause extremely hazardous driving conditions that compromise the safety of the driver and their passengers along with other drivers sharing the roads and highways. Because texting requires at least one hand on the device and the driver's eyes away from the road, the focus of the driver is not fully devoted to controlling the vehicle. This often leads to lane deviation that could possibly result in potentially dangerous situations.

Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.
