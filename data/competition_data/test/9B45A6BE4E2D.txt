Can aliens really create a face on the moon? No, they cant! I know this because the picture snapped of the face from 1976, was bit blurry, once they got abetter camera the picture became more clear and looked less like a face. Only some of the scientist beleived the face was a 'alien artifact'. There is proof that it is just a landform that looks like a face.

The picture from 1976 was a bad quality picture, it was blurry and you couldnt see much of the real features that were there. Once cameras got better and more HD the pictures got more clear and you could actually see the cracks and the rough parts if the landform. In 2001, the picture was good, it looked less like a face when the cameras got better, but it still had that face effect on it.

Only some of the scientist beleived that the face looking land form was created by aliens, not all. When they snapped the first picture in 1976, some of the scientist noticed the face and the first thing that came to there mind was that aliens did it. They started to go back and capture a picture of the face looking landform. Cyndonia became a priority for NASA when they arrived at the 'Red Planet' in September 1997.

They finnaly figured that it was just a regualr landform that had been created like face, not by aliens but by nature. The picture actually shows is the Martain equivlent of butte or mesa, those are landforms common around the American West. Scientist state that " It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho". Also he says "Thats the lava dome that taks the form of isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars".

The face on mars could have been crated by aliens though. Aliens cpuld have easily managed the curves and the ways the face looks, the nose, eyes, ears, mouth and the way it was even shaped looked like a alien head. It is very possible for it to be alins who have created this face, maybe it was a sign that aliens are here or asign that aliens know about humas.

Most landforms mostly get created about how the surroundings are or whos there. There is stuff called man made and thats made by human, but no ones ever heard of alien made. Since they used the better camera with better pixels and better HD, it turns out that the face looking lanform on Mars was just another weird looking landform, no aliens, just landform.
