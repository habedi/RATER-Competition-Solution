Have you noticed? Have you noticed the sidewalk person-population is increasing? More and more people are taking public transportation, walking, and biking. smog and polution are coating our cities like a blanket.

"Passenger cars are resonsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Up to 50% in car intensive areas around the

U.S.

'' says source 1. There is an experimental town in Germany, named Vauban, whose streets are filled with people instead of cars. This seems to be the growing trend, a movement, called "smart-planning''. As cars decrease, the city of Vauban is more compact. They no longer have a worry about where to set parking. Stores are set on main roads, no longer having a mall on the side of a congested highway. Everything's just a simple walk away. Things are simple here, and air is clean.

Unlike Vauban, France had to take things to a new level. As smog layed heavy over Paris, a driving ban was set to clear the air. Though congestion was down 60% in the capital, cold nights and warm days caused a layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed in this case, the tax policy made by France, favors diesel over gosoline. "Deisels make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe" says source 2.

As France set a ban on cars for a little while, America seems to be just losing intrest in motor vehicles. Source 4 tells us " Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." As driving decreases so does the polution, creating healthier enviroments.

IN CONCULSION, AT LEAST MAKE THE TOPIC INTERESTING. PLEASE AND THANK YOUUUUUU :)
