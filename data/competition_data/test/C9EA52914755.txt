The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

It is only a coincidence that it looks like a face.

People want to believe that there is life on Mars, but they do not have the scientific evidence that they would need to prove this.

First of all, the cameras that are used are the best they can possibly make.

They even used the maximum resolution the camera can poduce.

It can even see if there were to be small objects near the Face.

They've used those cameras and they didn't see anything that proved to be life-like.

People are indenial.

They want to believe that there is life on another planet.

The media doesn't help with this issue either.

This idea of an alien monument is everywhere in the media and some actually believe it is real.

This Face is just being used as an entertainment value and a huge money maker for movie producers in Hollywood.

There are no facts that prove there are aliens on Mars, but some people are too stubborn to listen to what NASA has to say.

They would rather believe Hollywood or other unreliable sources with no facts.

The United States of America is proof enough that this Face is in fact a landform.

Natural things like this occur all the time in the American West.

We have all kinds of oddly shaped landforms that we know came naturally.

This case with Mars seems no different than what happens on Earth.

Conspiracy theorists believe that NASA is hiding alien evidence from the public, but the photos were released and it is plain to see that there is no alien activity happening.

The Face of Mars is just a regular mesa that is normal to people on Earth.

It only looks like a face because there are certain shadows that can trick us into thinking that facial features were intentionally added.

Although it is pretty incredible, it is nothing more than just a natural landform.

It's unfortunate that it was just a false alarm, according to scientists, but it's time to face the facts.
