Dear State Senator,

There is arising conflict on whether or no to abolish the electoral college system. It has it's pros and its cons but reasonablly, the cons out-do the pros. The electoral college needs to be taken over by popular vote in Presidential elections. It creates a more biased vote in the sense that the electors vote may oppose yours. On another note, the disaster factor is a negative factor of the electoral college.

First, in the electoral college, you will never be 100% that your states' electors will vote in your favor. By doing a popular vote, voters will be ensured that their vote is literally counting towards the candidate. For example, If you lived in Florida and wanted to vote for Mitt Romney, you'd vote for him. The electors may vote for Obama and just ignored the winner-take-all strategy and vote for Obama. In a sense, the electors may pay attention to the winner-take-all strategy. The problem is that in past elections, the popular vote has had majority and the electors vote for the minority.

Secondly, a flaw of the electoral college is the disaster factor. It is pretty much when a majority votes for a candidate and the electors give the minority vote. If the popular vote was to occur, then the candidate the majority wanted would've got elected.

To conclude, the electoral system should be removed because it is biased and popular vote will be more ensuring and 100% true. On my behalf, popular vote will be much better for everyone .

Sincerely,

Tj Gries
