Technology is becoming more and more advanced as time passes by. The Facial Action Coding System is a program that can tell a users emotion by using a 3-D model of the users face. This new technology is a valuable piece of equiptment for a classroom. This can assist teachers create better lesson plans for the students. In addition, it will clear up the confusion over mixed emotions concercing the classroom.

With this technology in classrooms there will not be a feeling of being left behind.

Less and less students will be confused in class leading to better test rates. Also modified tests and task due to the Facial Action Coding System will improve on the lerning material to highten knowledge. Knowing this, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable in the classroom.
