Dear Principal,

I feel that you should require each student to perform at least one community service task each semester. This would help students learn responsibility and sacrifice by having them give up their free time to help out their community. The services they do could be as easy as reading to people with disabilities. They could also clean up the highway, or help remove graffiti.

Many of your students are already doing these things and more. They also feel that it would be good for the school to aid the community. Some of them don't even go outside of their neighborhood while helping. It's just so easy to be a helping hand!

Requiring service community tasks may not help all of the students to become more responsible, but it will make many of them think more about helping others. This is good for them in the long run, for when they become adults. Many jobs require talking to and working with other people. Responsibility will make it easier to do your job. And making sacrifices is something that you are going to have to do sometime in your life. Whether you become a parent, or a teacher, or even a doctor, you will have to give up some of your time and maybe even something bigger. Having students perform community service tasks will only help in this area.

Of course, you will anger some students by doing this, but there will never be a decision made anywhere about anything that will make everybody happy. And only one task per semester isn't much. It's so much better than having them do at least four a year, or something like that.

Thank for using your time to read this letter. I hope this helps you in making your decision about requiring your students to be helpful in our wonderful community.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
