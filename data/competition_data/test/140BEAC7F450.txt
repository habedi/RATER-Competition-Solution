Venus is the secound planet from the sun and yet it is also the hottest. It is also the closest planet the resembile Earth. It orbits the sun just like Earth and it is decently close to Earth. Mars is also kind of like Earth but not like Venus is. I think that Venus is very worthly to pursuit but with all the dangers I don't think we should visit, but I do think that we should keep studing.

According to the text "Whille Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very callenging place to examine more closely." This shows that Venus is safe to study here from earth and that there is no dangeres with looking at it with a microscope. This shows that we can study Venus and still be safe here on Earth.

I also think that we shouldn't have anyone on a ship go to Venus just yet until we study it more and figure out how to land the ship. According to the text " Eah previous mission was unmmanned, and for good reason, since no pacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe the issue expalins why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." This shows that is is not safe to send people on spacecrafts to Venus woth out them dying in a few hours. I odnt think that someones life is worth a few hours on anouther plant, all though it would be very benfishal. If they owuld take samples of things that we need to look at and some how get it back to us so we can study and get to kow the planet more, but i don't think that it is safe or smart to send people there.

Last but not leasat Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet. According to the text " These conditions are far more exterme than anyhting humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hotterst surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun." This shows that Venus is not safe and that it is too dangrous to survive. It is too hot and it is too dangrous for any human being.

With all of this information we should jsust hang back and study, maybe even try to make a ship that can with stand the pressure or even a suit that can survive with all the heat. We just need to study maybe run some trials on gettings ships there but not with people on them.
