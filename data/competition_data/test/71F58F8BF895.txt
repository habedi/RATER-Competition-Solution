I do not think that the new software would be of any use. Yes it is a good idea. But in the artical it gives us an example of if a student is confused or if a student looks mad or angry, the new software would explain the steps over until the student understands. The way I see it for example a student is working on a problem and the see something unusal in the problem and makes a confused face for a least a second the prgram would explain it to them. The student knows how to do the problem and knows how to solve it already but the program brought up step to exaplain it anyway. It would be useless the student could have soveld it already and would have been to the next problem but the Facial Action Coding System got in the students way just to show them how to do something they already know.

In the artical it also tells us to look in a minor or at a friend and make a "smiling face". The friend would see that you are happy yes, but we were told to make that face we had no desire to make that face happy or not, we just made the face, it was a forced smile. In the artical also it says that the computer program would be able to tell a force smile from a genuingly happy smile which what I just explaind that a smile is easy to manipulate. The program could be taking in false information and the program itself would not even know it.

In the artical it also exaplains that ads. That if a ad were to pop up and you would smile the prgram would show another ad just like the previous one and visvursa. The real question is have you ever ever seen a ad so many times that you become angry or frustrated and you smile because the "Skip ad" timer is getting closer and closer to zero the "FAC" would miss-understand your face and bring another ad just like that one. With this program I see very many problems that would not be able to be avoided.

"The new emotion-recognition software tracks facial movements!" Oh great but world class actors and actresses and pull the fake emotions off like no other. Some people dont show emotion and sometimes can be happy but no show it. with all these muscles in your face it could also mean that the face tracker would miss lead the face expressions. You as might as well have a dog look at you and be able to tell if your happy or not, becuase they are much better at reading face expressions.

It is a really good idea but it can be easily manipulated and also be in the way of varius things. I think it would be much much easier if you were to raise your hand and ask for help or just click a button that has different emotions that you could choose from to tell how you are feeling.
