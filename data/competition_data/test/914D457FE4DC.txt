Dear Principal,

I don't think you should change the requirements to play sports to maintaining a B average. Not everybody can maintain a B average. Some things are harder for certain people. They may have got an A in Math because they get math but a D in Science because they don't fully understand how the body works. Not every body is going to be smart. Some people are smart and others aren't to bright. Some people may be athletic but some aren't at all. Very few people are smart and athletic. Different people have different gifts.

If it is evident that they are trying in every class then they may just not get the material. Some people understand the most complex things but the easier theories just don't click in their heads. A lot of people have this problem and if they are going through an easy chapter and they don't understand but if they are doing most of their work it is evident that they just don't get it and maybe could use an extra hand.

If the majority of the students have a C average it might not be the students that have the problem. Everybody learns different but if the teacher only explains the material the same way over and over the students aren't going to get it. The teacher may have to look up other way to teach the material so it can click in the other students minds. Sometimes teachers pick what is easier to teach instead of what will the students understand better. Sometimes the crowd can be sent off by the leader and only the crowd is effected badly.
