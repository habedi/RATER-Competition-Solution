Dear TEACHER_NAME,

From a teachers point of view, I completely agree with you and your policy. Many students here would do anything to be on a sports team and I think this will raise many peoples grades up and will make our school better. Although from a students perspective, nearly 90% of the students here have a C as there average grade. I honestly think that you should consider having the average grade to be a C because some students are doing everything they can and doing the best that they can and only coming up with a C. As a student, I know how other students feel and what they go through. Since your the principal students are often intimidated by you and don't feel comfortable talking to you about what goes on behind closed doors. For some unfortunate students, all they have to make them feel like there actually something is sports. They have many different emotions building inside them and they've got to let it out somehow without getting in trouble and they usually let all there emotions out in sports. Sports is some peoples passion or in other words there "get away." For me tumbling is my passion and i know when I go out there and do flips and other things it feels as if the world around me has disappeared. It's the best feeling in the world and I would hate for them to miss out on this just because there passing grade isn't good enough. Life is harder then others for some students here and they usually come from a bad home life and the best they can do in situations like that is a C grade which is still a passing grade. Please give these students a chance to do one thing in their life that they enjoy, let them have a "get away" so they won't take there anger out on other things like other students or themselves. I know you would like all of us to have an A or B but the honest truth is all of us are gifted in different areas. I think you should let these students have a chance to do what they love and if there grades aren't suitable for you then get them a tutor or take any other route then just not letting them play at all. There's always a better road or route to take, you just have to find it. Listen to your students TEACHER_NAME. It will make an effective difference on how you think or look at things.

Yours truly,

STUDENT_NAME
