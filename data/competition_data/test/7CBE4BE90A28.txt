The Face from the article, "Unmasking the Face on Mars." was indeed not created by aliens. Evidence from the photos taken show that the Face was just a rock formation with no artifacts of life around it. The Face was also in an area for formations like that to be common.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens because there is no proof in the pictures that were taken. Pictures were taken in the dates 1976, 1998, and 2001. In each of these three picutres taken there is so definate evidence that the formation was created by aliens. Instead, the pictures show that the formation is common and just happen to look like a face. The text states, "... Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located... a cloudy time of year on the Red Panet. the comera... had to peer through wispu couds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." Based on the information from the text, i can see why people could still believe that the Face was created by aliens. The text goes on to say, "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." this statement from the text verifies that any dicrempancies that were argued about earlier, were now out of the argument. Image was to clear to argue about anything. What was seen in the photo was very clear and there were no signs of alien trace.

The Face was in an area that was common for formations like it to be found in. The author states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa- landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle BUtte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava some that takes the form of an isolated mesa avout the same height os the Face on Mars." Therefore, this gives more evidence on how the Face on Mars was not created by aliens and was a normal formation.

The Face on Mars was a normal formation based on factual ecvidence from scientist. Pictures show that there is no sign of aliens on mars. If there were aliens, the picture would have shown eviidence concluding that the formation was created by aliens. Secondly, the formation was in an area that was common for buttes or mesas. For the reason listed above, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens, however: the Face was a natural landfrom just like we have here on Earth.
