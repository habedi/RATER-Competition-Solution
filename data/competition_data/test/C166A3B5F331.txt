More people should join this program because, you can travel to many different places overseas with many different animals. A couple places of those include New Orleans, and Greece. The animals you travel with get to be in a new place and get plenty of food and water on their trip.

Also your life could change big time. You an go from working one or two part time jobs to being in new countries! Thats what Luke Bomberger did, and he loves it! Best change he's made in his entire life.

You will be helping Europe regain it's food supplies, animals, and so much more! Which is why the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys. So they can take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Joining would give you an incredible once in a lifetime oppertunity. You won't find anywhere else that lets you travel around the world on a boat with animals. Also this oppertunity is only given to certain people!

In conclusion to why more people should join the program, I think you should because you travel to many different places, your life could change completly, you'll help Europe, and joiniing this will be an amazing oppertunity and won't ever come again! So please, come join this amazing program please!
