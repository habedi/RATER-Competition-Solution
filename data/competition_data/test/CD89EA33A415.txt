Do you think a computer would be able to tell your emotional expressions on your face? I think that would be crazy if a computer really could see how your feeling on the emotions on your face. There is six different emotions the computer will know happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. It works just like how you talk to someone every day there going to know your facial expressions.

While your on your computer if your on there for something for school or just scrolling to see whats on there your computer will know if you don't like what your on or not so it will change it to something you do like. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", Dr. Huang. This could be good for students who struggle with a topic there learning about in school and could help them make it a little bit easier. It will help student actually wanting to do the assignment instead of giving up on it right away.

Say if your little brother wanted to play a video call of duty for example they would animae it to be more of a kid virison or take them to another or easier cite. If you see an ad you like it will take you to a similar ad but if you dont like that ad it will try to take you to something you might like. It's just all how your facial expressions are.

Your probably wondering how the computer is going to work in the first place well the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. It will have 44 major muscles and the model must have move like human muscles. That is how the computer is going to know if your happy or sad ect. The computer will also have video imagery so the software tracks know your facial movements.

I think this computer will be a great thing in the future to help kids and even adults with work, and school ect. To see what a computer could do just by see your facial expressions is pretty cool. I feel like this computer will help a lot of students with there school work and improve there work.
