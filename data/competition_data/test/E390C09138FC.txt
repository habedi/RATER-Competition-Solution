Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students in our school should take part in community service. I think students should take part in community service because they could help tutor elementary school children, clean up liter left by others, or volunteer in food shelters. This is a great way to help the environment, the people and children.

One great way by taking part in the community service is helping tutor elementary school kids. This can help the little ones learn more and get higher grades. People at our school could volunteer in this event by helping every Monday and Thursday after school hours. They would meet up with the elementary school kids and tutor them in subjects such as reading, math, science, or social studies.

Another great way to take part in community service is by cleaning up liter left by others in the park or school grounds. This would help keep our environment clean. Students could sign up for this opportunity by joining a club. They would help clean up liter on free days during the week.

Another amazing way to take part in community service is by volunteering in food shelters. The students could help doing this by bringing food to the shelters and feeding the food to the ones in need of food.

Helping in community service would not take away much time away from what they want or need. People could do it during their free time. Students should take part in this excellent opportunity because it's going to help the community. Students should be required to perform in community service because it helps the environment. Helping the community is very important. Anyone in the community should help in tutoring elementary school children, cleaning up liter, or helping in food shelters because it's a great thing to do.

Sincerely,

The students.
