Dear. Principal

I think that your idea is good but very unfair. Cause there is students that always try there best and do there best that can play sports but just don't have a B average. At the same time your idea is good but then what about the students that never get to play sports because of there grades and everything. I mean great students do good grades and keep everything in place . So you could give them a change to play a sport by telling them if they get on the team they have to bring there grades up, or there out, you could tell them that. Some would even do anything to bring there grades up to a B average and be on there favorite team of sports.

Your idea is great because maybe that way some students bring up there grades and do better in school but sometimes you just have to give them changes to play in that sports so they can do better. Like lets say this student wants to play really bad so they bring there grades up and they play, but them there grades come down and they get kick off the team, they feel bad!! So Mrs. principal i like your idea cause maybe that way the students bring there grades up and do better and always have a better future. So for me anyway or another your idea has a good side and a bad side. Its just matter of fact what the students do. If they do anything to be on a sport team then they should bring up there grades and always keep a B average!

They can always participate and make part of a group but they always have to keep there grades up. Better grades for all students is just great cause that way they can always participate in clubs, and sports. So i would feel good if you took the time to look at my opinion and think about it. So anyway or another i like the idea but sometimes you have to think about the other students, you can always help them, so they can bring there grades up. Well that's the way i think, that's what i would do if i was principal of a school. Always tell them to try there best to get to the point where they feel good about them self's.

For me good grades in school bring a better life and future for us. So for them students out there that want to play any kind of sport, bring up your grades, everyone can do it, if you try your best!
