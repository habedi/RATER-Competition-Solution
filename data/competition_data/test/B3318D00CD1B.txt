Dear Mr. Principal,

I understand that you are considering a change in the school policy that will not let students participate in sports unless they have a grade B average. I think this is a horrendous idea! We should not change this school policy because it would be unfair to many students, students would not be getting as much exercise and less people would be no longer be able to try and enjoy new sports and the things that come from them.

It would be very unfair to some students if you changed this school policy. Many students really struggle in school and have hard times learning or remembering what they are being taught. A great deal of kids have lower than a B average and it would not be right to take away their privileges to play sports. Also, there would be a lot less students that normal who would be able to play on their school's sports teams. Therefore, many teams would have less players eligible for the team and they may end up having a horrible year because the best players did not have high enough grades. This is also a bad thing for those students who take pride in their school sports like cheerleaders or fans! Who would want to support a team that sucks?

Without school sports, I know for a fact that I would not be getting as much exercise as usual, maybe even none at all. We are already the fattest nation in the world and we should be creating new opportunities for children to exercise, have fun and stay healthy. In my opinion, this new policy would be the exact opposite. Kids need to learn healthy habits while they are young and being cut from school sports for not having good enough grades constitutes against that. Proven studies show that people who exercise more also have better eating habits than those who do not exercise as much as they should. Cutting grade C average students from sports can lead them to an unhealthy lifestyle.

Many people find out what they love to do because of school activities they can sign up for. School has definitely led me to some amazing things that I love, but would have never actually tried to do on my own. If students participation in school sports is based on how high or low their grades may be at the time, they are being taken away from some really great opportunities that could end up changing their lives. Part of what makes school a fun place to be is because of sports; it opens you up to a bunch of new things to try and enjoy as well as people to become friends with. Sports are a great way of taking up children's time and without them to fill our lives, we could become bored. This is often the reason that students start to try bad things such as drugs and alcohol. School sports are a way to keep students safe and involved.

We should definitely leave our school policy the way it is currently. Changing it is a terrible idea because many students would feel as if they are being treated unfairly, children would not be getting the amount of exercise that they need to be healthy and because dozens of students would be missing great opportunities to try, maybe even fall in love, with new sports.
