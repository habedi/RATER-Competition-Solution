Learning during the summer will cause many students to be successful in school; As long as they are learning by project that the designed to help themselves. The projects that students have to complete during the summer should be student-designed because it allows for students to improve their creativity skills, it causes them less stress during the summer, and it ensures that they are learning about what they need.

In this century, students do not have many chances to improve their creative abilities. Almost all students in America can choose their courses from middle school to college; by having the power to choose classes, they might only take classes to benefit their knowledge, yet it does not help their creativity. Today, teenagers are more interested in becoming a lawyer, doctor, or a business owner; which they do not realize also requires creativity. Becoming a doctor is a dream for many people of all ages, even though it is a long process that takes a lot of knowledge and hard work; the ability to be creative and work around the problem is very vital for this job. If teachers design the projects that the students have to complete during the summer, it will limit and weaken the creativity skills of students. It is known that every skill needs practice to so there can be improvement, without practice the skill might disappear. In order to be successful in life, people need variety of skills. If a person does not have any skills, they will find that it is very hard to find a job and they might find it hard to be successful in school. Learning may be a very stressful task for some children, teens, and even adults: The projects that need to be completed in the summer should be student-designed project, in order to reduce stress on the students doing them.

It is obvious that every person in this world faces stress; stress is an emotion that can cause many conflicts in one's life. Student's can easily have stress, possibly due to their school, home, or work environment. The stress students face can greatly impact their mental health in a bad manner; therefore it is very important for schools to try to create a stress-free environment to help students. To help reduce the stress on students, the school should allow them to design their summer projects themselves, so they are able to complete tasks based on their ability and without difficulties to maximize their successes. At the pediatrics office, teens and young adults are asked about their stress level; which showcases the importance of having low to no stress in their lives. Stress can lead to many mental health problems, which can create physical health problems; therefore it is vital that schools do what they can to reduce the stress they put on students. Allowing the projects to be student-designed will help decrease the amount of stress the students have during the summer, so students can better enjoy their vacation and as well work at their own pace to complete what needs to be completed. Student-designed projects will as well help students learn about topics that they lack knowledge on or topics they need to improve on.

Clearly, there is always room for improvement; Whether it is on a specific topic or a special skill, there is always something new one can learn. In school, teachers cover many topics with their students to verify that their students have knowledge on what they are tested on. Teachers may not completely know what their students do not understand, because many students study very hard for a test, yet not understand the material completely. If a student has an upcoming math test that they do not understand, they are likely to memorize their notes to achieve a good grade without fully understanding the topic. If the students could design their summer projects themselves, than they can relearn and having a better understanding of topics that they do not understand. The students can be more successful in their studies if given the chance to earn knowledge about what they need. It may be true that teacher-designed projects can be more effective in teaching students a specific subject or topic, but teacher-designed projects can be too hard, they can cause stress, and they may further confuse students. Teacher-designed projects can be very complex, therefore students may have a very difficult time trying to understand the project especially during the summer, where they are distracted. As well, the projects given by the teacher can confuse the students about the topic because the students lack of understanding, causing them an increase in their stress level.

Conclusively, the summer projects given to students should be student-designed. The students having the ability to design their summer projects will improve their creativity, reduce their stress, and most importantly ensure that the students are learning about the subjects that they need. The education system in America is known as the best education system in the world; yet it causes many students stress and causes them to be lose some skills by learning new ones. Allowing summer projects to be student-design will be a step in the correct direction to better the education system. It is important to reform the system and try to make it perfect, so the upcoming generations can have the best education possible and a better future. Students, parents, teachers, and even the common man can petition to better the system: By petitioning, people can create a brighter future for themselves, their children, grandchildren, and even their country as a whole.
