I agree with policy 1, but not without certain rules. Cell phones are used in almost everyone's daily life. It makes people feel safer when they can pull a phone from their pocket and call for help. Unfortunately, in today's society they are used for more then needed. I think it would be all right to allow children to use cell phones during breaks and lunch, but in classrooms the rules would have higher punishment. For example, making the cost higher to get it back or longer detention. That would be more suitable.

When people are stopped from doing something completely they will most likely do it more. In my personal experience, about six months ago I went to a school that had such tight policies about cell phones, if phones were even seen in your pocket they would be taken up. Therefore the children used them all the time, in class, lunch, anywhere and anyway they could.

Now, when I go this school, children are allowed to carry cell phones around and I see them being used so much less, the teachers aren't always talking about how the phones are never allowed, they make it easier on everyone. Seen and not heard.

Of course, in extreme cases, policy 2 would be better, it depends solely on what kind of environment your in. Although in my school I see no good reason why not to allow cell phone usage on breaks, I think it would create a less stressful place. Teachers could even send notifications to the students, if that could be allowed, about homework updates or due dates. Besides cell phone are probably one of the most used, most owned devices in America, why not use them to help us with school and not get us in trouble.
