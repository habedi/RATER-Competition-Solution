Dear Principal,

Your idea for changing the average from a B letter grade to a C letter grade is a very good idea.

Some people would extremely disagree with your plans to get the students grades up I agree to the fullest.

I would go along with the changes you wish to make because in doing so the students would work harder, they would have to set good goals, and get all their work done on time.

One reason why I agree with your changes is because students wouldn't work as hard as they needed to get a B grade.

Many students think that if they get a C it would be the same if that grade was actually an A or a B.

They would think it was the same because they would get treated the same by their coach or team mates because as long as they have a C they get to be part of a team.

Although the parents of these students might not be as happy with their child getting a C, the child wouldn't really mind because they still get all the privileges as the kids that are getting an A or a B.

The second reason I agree with your thoughts is because if the students can get by with a C then they would just be at the border of a C grade and wouldn't set any goals for themselves.

If students are doing well, then will probably want to keep it up and do better.

They can do that by setting goals for themselves.

For example, if a student has a C then their goal will probably be just to keep up with that C because they wouldn't have to do any better.

The third reason why I would go along with your ideas is because it would get the students to turn in their work on time and actually do the work to the fullest.

If a student turns in an assignment and gets a C because there is poor work done the student would not care as much because they would still have a C average and get to participate in sports.

Another reason why changing a C grade to a B would be affective is because they have to do the work to get that grade.

By actually doing the work the student or students would learn more if they are the type of student who learns by doing.

If they do it wrong on the assignment then they would probably get a question like that wrong on the quiz or test.

Although many students might give you a hard time for changing the system, or talk inappropriately about you behind your back, I am right there with you.

They are the ones who are deciding whether or not they get to part of the team by proving themselves in their classes and getting at least a B average.

For the reasons of working hard, setting goals, and actually getting work done the right way students should have to maintain at least a B average to participate in sports.
