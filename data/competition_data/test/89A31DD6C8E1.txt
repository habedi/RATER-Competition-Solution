I think policy one is better, standing on my own opinion if you have a phone at school and say a fire starts or someone is holding up the school and school phones are down, a student that has a phone can use it to call 911, family, friends, etc.

Even though I think Policy 1 is better I think turning your phones off in class isn't completely right either, say a student needs to call a parent to bring work in. Someone could easily argue that there is a school phone to use in the situation, yes that person would be right but what if the number is out of the area? Then again someone could argue that there is the principle phone to use that can call that number, what if the principle is busy with two students fighting and or not a work?

Now Policy 2 does have some justice to it, some say it is a distraction from learning. I say only if the teachers make it a distraction from learning by pointing out a student and pausing the class to handle a student with a cell phone. If a student chooses not to learn then that is the student's choice. Those terms could be used badly but a student does have a choice, having a phone can be bad. But I think there are plenty of justice and injustice on having a phone at school.

Till someone makes a final decision then we will just keep debating on this subject. But I would have to say Policy 1 is better for the school, parents, and students. But there are more rules that could be applied to Policy 1 to help make Policy 1 and Policy 2 be combined and made into a better rule/policy.
