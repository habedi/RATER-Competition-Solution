Dear principal,

I am writing you to let you know that your almost new policy for students participating in sports is not the way to go. How could you try to take the one thing most kids come to school for. I mean learning is one thing but taking a joy that someone have is really unexceptable in my book. So you telling me that if i wanted to join a sport i couldn't because the rules say that i have to have a grade B average to play anyways. I'm not the smartest kid around and no i may not be passing my classes with a grade B average, but you know what im passing and that's all that matters. Or how about you bring all your middle school report card and you show me a B average and maybe just maybe a B- average will be ok but until the your new policy will not and i say this with a meaning will not be followed for as long as i go to your school. I thought you were trying to make your school a better place and with no school activities and school is nothing. Like last year when i ran track i took this school to district and without the sports and after school activities this place would be nothing just like it was even before i went to school here but my older sister went here before i got here and without her on the volleyball team, this school wouldn't have the plaques and rosters hanging up in the gym and without my brother coming to this school your basketball team wouldn't have the broken records and all other stuff put in this school to make it look good, so if you wanna make a policy change on sports and after school activities saying you have to have a GRADE B AVERAGE TO PLAY you need to think about what this school will be if it didn't have it in the first place
