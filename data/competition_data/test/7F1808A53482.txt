Bright lights, keyboards clicking, cold and uncomfortable seats. Sometimes we just need to take a break from non-stop working in school. I believe that all student should participate in one extracurricular activity, whether its a sport or an after school club, its good to have some free time.

Its important to get out of the work environment and to enjoy yourself. Everyone must go outside and participate in something other than school. I think its necessaryÂ for every kid to go outside and have some fun, play a sport or draw. Its very important to take a mental break and let you mind regroup and to do it in a way you enjoy! Not just a mental break but physically, working on a computer can give you head aches and neck pains. It helps to move around, even if your in a club. To get your hands on, is something every kid should experience. It could be making a poster or picking up trash, everybody should participate.

A long day at school can cause stress and pressure, one way to release that is by joining a club or sport. Mental health is extremely important, and sometimes we forget about it. Doing something you enjoy gets rid of all that stress built up and every student should release it by doing something they like. We are always being pushed by our teachers to do our best and to try our hardest, but sometimes we need something to relax to, and something we truly look forward to. Relaxation is key to being mentally healthy. Some students dont get the chance to relax, there fore all the students must participate in something relaxing to them. All students should be able to particpate in a activity without there being pressure to do the best. Students should have to have the time to relax and enjoy what they are participating in.

When being required to do an extracurricular activity, students tend to have more productivity. They tend to be more relaxed and put more effort into what they are doing. They are able to try there best in result of having some free time to relax and have fun. Students are more motivated to work, and are mentally and physically prepared to work. There grades might even increase and they might be, in whole, a lot happier. As their productivity and motivation improve so does their focus. In having their own time to take a break and relax they are better focused on their work when it comes time. Having more focus means more work getting done. Students are better at getting their work done on time, learning more and/or better, and are more motivated in school.

Therefore being required to participate in an extracurricular activity improves there over all well being. I agree with the principal, all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because it results in, mentally and physically, healthier students and its for their own good.
