This essay was about exploring Venus. this essay was interesting because it talks about space and one of our important planets. although Venus is sometimes called the ''Evening Star'' is can have dangers as well. The author was talking about how Venus is the second planet from the sun which means it can be very hot. I think this planet would be fun too research.

There can be dangers going to venus. He stated in the past aa previous mission didnot survive the landing for more than a couple of hours. ''Not a single spaceship has touched down on venus for more than three decades''. I think that it is ok to do research on venus. But I believe that it is way too dangerous to go too beause people who went to venus never returned home.

This author gave lots of helpful details on how to study venus. Some of his details included electronics made of silicon carbide simulating the chaos of venus surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions. You can also read books or watch movies about Venus. He also said NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. I think some of these studies are neat.

Despite the dangers this author thinks it's very cool to study venus even though there are dangers. He gives lots of his opinions on what is going to happen. He talks about how NASA has the idea of sending humans to go study venus. Which I personally don't think that is a good idea. If they can figure out the right equipment then I could agree with that.

Overall the author did a great job explaning about NASA and venus. Venus is a very ''hot" planet and would be very interesting to study. I liked how he talked about this topic. I think next he should talk about another planet. This is how I feel about this topic.
