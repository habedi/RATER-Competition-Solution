Dear, principle

I believe that it shouldn't be allowed for students to have their phones on them during school.

They wouldn't pay attention in classrooms. Students could lower their grade scores. They also could behave badly.

If students had their cell phones with them during class they could be texting during their lessons or their assignments. By doing that they could lower their grade scores because, they wouldn't pay attention to what they are suppose to do and they would be confused, and they would just end up not doing their assignments. If students don't pay attention in class they wouldn't understand how to complete their assignments, tests, and quizzes. Other students would be distracted because they could see their classmate texting during class and he or she can get distracted. That student wouldn't want to tell their teacher because that student could be scared of being disliked.

Students would take advantage of this and start sneaking their cell phones into classrooms and text their friends for the answers to their assignments or tests.

Their cell phones should be turned off and kept in their lockers. If they have an emergency they should go to the office to use their telephone. Students make it seem like cell phones and texting their friends is a necessity to everyday life, but in reality it really isn't.

This is why i believe that students shouldn't bring their phones to classrooms.
