Dear Principal,

I am an 8th grader here and I believe that the new policy that you are considering is a wise one. The students in our classes seem to be struggling through the day, but have so much drama outside and in of class.

This athletics program has a positive appearance, making sure that the students have a healthy body, and providing enough exercise. I feel that this is like an optical illusion. Although the gym is completing its duty of providing the exercise needed, the kids are having more of a social life instead of a more productive workout. I can understand that they can talk to their friends and have a good time, and I am not trying to protest against that, but the attitude and the unwillingness to understand classes outside of gym are not their free time seem to grow as the school year progresses.

Drama is carried outside of the gym and into classrooms and even passing periods. Some of my classes last year had so much of this, I couldn't even learn much during the class. Sometimes our classes would stall as the teacher tried to explain to them the reason not to interrupt. Due to the lack of learning in the classrooms, they have a negative correlation with their overall grades and the gym attitudes.

I can see that the "popular news" coming out of the gym is always running through their minds, like, "someone is going out with someone", and "they broke up!?" This also prohibits their mind to think during class, and sometimes it leaks into the classroom; starting up a totally unrelated seems to come out a lot when that happens.

I do not want to seem unfriendly to these fellow classmates, or ranting on them. I just want to express my logic in what I see happening in the classrooms, and explaining why I believe your new policy is a good one. Thank you for taking your time to read my letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
