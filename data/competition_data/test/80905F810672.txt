Students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to. Some students have disabilities which prohibit them from doing these activities, are not interested, or do not have the time. If they feel that they do not need to perform the extracurricular activities provided by the school, then staff members should not force it upon them. The requirement is unreasonable and should not be put into effect.

Some students cannot participate in these activities because they are physically or mentally prohibited by a disability. They need special care that they will not be able to receive if the school puts the new requirement into effect. Asking them to perform these activities is a step too big for them to take. Many of these students already have difficulty in school, and if the school forces them to take an extracurricular activity, their time at school would become even more difficult. The school cannot ask too much of these students, as they are doing what they can to improve. There are better ways to help students with disabilities, rather than expecting them to perform activities that they cannot.

Other students do not have interest in the extracurricular activities that the school provides. They have activities that they can perform outside of school. Their time outside of school is important, as it gives them freedom to do what they want. Perhaps they would prefer horseback riding or extreme sports, but the school clearly cannot provide these for them. Students can choose from a wider variety of extracurricular activities outside of what the school gives to them. When students get ready for college, activities outside of school will help them decide what path they want to take. They should be able to pursue their own career paths without being held back. They are unique, and their creativity should be embraced.

They should be the ones to choose if they want to participate in the activities the school provides, not the principal.

A large percentage of students in the United States say that they have too much homework, or they have responsibilities outside of school. Requiring them to add another thing to worry about would likely cause stress and lack of sleep. Many students already do not receive the recommended eight hours of sleep, and another extracurricular activity will not help their cause. Too many responsibilities causes the brain to release a stress hormone, which can have devastating effects on a person's thought process and physical health. If a student cannot think clearly because of stress, their grades will go down and they will not succeed. With too much stress, a person can become tired and irritable. This irritability would cause the general mental health of the school to decrease. Though some students will benefit from having another extracurricular activity, most will not.

If the principal decides to go through with this plan, then the growth of the students will be stunted. Adding this requirement will not help the students who have disabilities or those who have responsibilities to do after school. It is not the school's job to dictate whether students participate in the school's extracurricular activities or those that are provided by other programs. The school should be doing their best to help the students, not put another weight on their shoulders.
