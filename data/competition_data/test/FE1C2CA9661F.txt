Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I really disagree with you. the reasons why i disagree with you are that you are making it too late a notice to change the requirements now and it is really hard for kids to keep a B average if they have sports. by the time you read this letter i hope you keep the requirements the same.

First off you are trying to change the requirements too fast. statistics show that 85% of athletes on school teams have a C average. How are you suppose to play if u don't have enough players because they are not meeting the new requirements? that means that our school will have to forfeit many games because there are not enough players. A forfeit is a lost and i know you love sports and you don't want our sports teams to loose. For example, our basketball and football teams have been undefeated for 5 years!!! If they forfeit they will end their winning streak.

Secondly, how our you suppose to expect our players to practice and play their best trying to bring up their grades because you changed the requirements in the middle of the season. they would possibly have to miss some practices and forfeit some games just to bring up their grade. Also, having players focussing on their work and sports too much can put a lot of stress on them. Its not good to have stress as a teenager.

Now that you see my view i hope that you keep the requirements the same. Remember that it is too late of a notice and your players could have a lot of stress on them.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
