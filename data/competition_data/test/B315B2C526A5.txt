Luke's point of view might be that it was fun but i just can't be the only thing that ido in life. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips themost of any Seagoing Cowboy. He was proud to break a record but he was alsovery mad because of him being 18 and still doing the trips on being a SegoingCowboy. He was also working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldnt say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. But luke thought of it that way and not by how many trips he was going to make or the number of places he was going to go. He knew that it was going to be a opportunity of a lifetime because you hardly ever get a opportunity of a lifetime when you are working to part time jobs and trying to raise moeny for your own self to live life. And when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldnt say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

Also when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat trip if luke would have said no then his friend Don Reist that invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat trip would have tought or asked why do you not want to go because because you wil get to go a lot of places that you would not be able to go also because you would get to havea full boat ride there and a emty boat ride back. Plus i will be there with you the whole time that you are there so you do not have to be scaryed if that is why you don't want to go. Also because you will be able to go and see part of the wolrd that you may never agin get the chance to go and see agin so we don't leave for anouther 2 days so that will give you a chance to think about the trip we are really hopeing you can make it but if you can't then we understand why because it is your chose so just please just think about it because it would mean alot to me and the other guys if you came. So he got Luke to say yes but he was only going to be there for a little bit because he has other things to do like get a house and also get a better job then the ones he already has so only for one year. But after that one year he had made it clear that he wanted to stay longer because he had stared to think that this was his job and after a while one of the boys came to him and asked him what would you think if you could stay here because our captian says that you got a job working with us if thats what you want to do is work with us but you do not have to if you don't then we have to take you back because we can't just let you stay like work for us. So Luke sid of couse i will work with you guys but we have to stop so i can get the rest of my stuff plusemy colth and i can just keep it in my bedroom right of couse you can. But no break able stuff is allowed on the ship oun less you don't have any where else to put it then we have a little bit of room were we can put it where it will be safe.
