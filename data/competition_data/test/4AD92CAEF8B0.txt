Dear TEACHER_NAME;

I think that the best Policy you should go with is Policy 1which states "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time." I think this policy is the best behind these three reasons, One i think that if they have there phones in free times like lunch or free periods they can call there parents to tell them that they are ok, and that they are having a good time or that they loved the lunch that there mom made for them. The second reason why i think that they should allow cell phones is that if they need to have there parents come pick them up because they are not felling well they could call them or text them during lunch or free period .If the student left there lunch money at home they could call a relative to come and bring them the money or food from a place they want so they will not have to be hungry. My last reason why i think that there should be phones are that if something happens to the student when they are walking to school they could call there parents for emergency's .Say that if they could not bring there cell phones to school and something where to happen to them on there walk they would have no way to communicate with there parents to tell them what happened or for the police or ambulance to call from there phone . So TEACHER_NAME these are all of the three reasons why i think that phone's should be allowed in school and should only be used for emergency's and at free period's and lunch time when it says they are suppose to use there phone's and not during class texting when the teacher is teaching and the phone goes off during class . So TEACHER_NAME

if you would accept my letter and my ideas in why i think it is a good idea i would really appreciate it. Thank you .
