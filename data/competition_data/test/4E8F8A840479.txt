Dear Principal,

I have noticed that you are reconsidering the schools cell phone policy. I have been informed of what the two policies consist of and I have made a confident decision of which decision I think you should choose. In my opinion, I think it would be best for the school if policy one were used. I say this for many reasons that I will state in this essay. I hope you understand that do not choose this policy only for my personal satisfaction of using my phone in school, but because I think that is the most beneficial for the student body.

I believe that if students were allowed to use cell phones in lunch and free periods during school that it might calm the students down a little more, because it lets them do something that they want to do without the risk of getting caught. If the students got a little more freedom from the faculty and administrators maybe the students might return the favor and be a little more focused.

My second reason for my support of policy one is the cell phone technology can be used in an educational way. These days many cell phones have internet. This can be used to for students to study or even work on assignments right from their mobile phone. Not only that but imagine how much easier it would be for teachers to communicate. Instead of using intercoms or sending notes, teachers can email other teachers right on their phones from anywhere in the school.

Keep in mind that I do understand why policy two is being strongly considered. I know that it would be harder to control students when they are all given opportunities to use their cell phones throughout the day, but if time of use is distributed correctly, giving students a reasonable, but still manageable period of time to use their phones in school. This will give enough freedom to students that they will act maturely.

I know that policy one will be right for the school and i hope it is the one you choose.

Sicerely
