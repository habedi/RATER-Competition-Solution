There are many dangers on venus. The atmosphere of venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide, which mean there isnt alot of oxygen and we need oxygen. the clouds on venus are made up of sulfuric acid. So if it were to rain we wouldnt be able to live becuase it would be raining acid. The planet earth is a nice comfortable temperature the we are used to. The planet venus has a surface temp of 800 degress fahrenheit which would make the planet inhabitable. The temperature of venus would melt metals. The pressure there could crush whole submariens. We do need to figure out a way of getting on that planet because our planet earth is slowly diteriating and we treat it wrong

The planet earth is a very comfortable planet. The ground on earth is a temperature that wouldent melt us to pieces instantly. Their is water, food, etc that can be here at earth so we can live here. their are jet planes that can fly low to the ground with no hazard but in venus you have to fly 30 miles above the ground because its to hot. Either way our curiosidy will het the best of js and start risking lives of many people to go and try to get someone on that planet. But that doesnt matter we need to make something that is heat resistant enough to be able to land on venus for exploration.

This is the reason why i think that venus is a worthy but dangerous pursuit. venus is a inhabitable planet at this moment. Earth is all we have right now. We are not treating this planet right and at the rate we are doing it weill make us have to migrate to a new planet mosy likely. This is my reasoning
