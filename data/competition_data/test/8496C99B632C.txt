The the face on mars is not a alien. It is a landfore that is kinda in the same shape as a human face, but the one we seen on Mars was ten times bigger than a human face.. We have been study Mars for aladn time we have not seen any sign of life but we thank their could be, but were not for sure. We took the picture from are spacecraft so it could be a little dusty their. We are going back to take another picture because the face was not that clear.

Mission controllers prepared to look again and try and get a better picture. It is not easy to target Cydonia in fact, its a lot of work to get all of are reseach to get of it together. We just dont pass over the face very often.

We only seen Cydonia one time and we still did not really get a good picture.

What we thank is that it is not a alien it is jus a big dust cloud that has be moved around and kinda looks like a human face but is not because it says it is ten times bigger than a human face.
