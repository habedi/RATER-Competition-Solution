Do you think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be a great opportunity for you? I think it is a great experience for anyone and everyone. Becoming a

Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity because, you get to help many people that are in need, see lots of the world and have great experiences, and it is lots of fun.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is the best thing I ever did. I got to help many people. When you get to the different places, you see how you can really make a difference with what you are doing. It really made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. This is only one reason becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity.

Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see and experience lots of the world. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, on my nine trips, I got to see many parts of Europe and China. The most special parts of my trips were seeing the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gonola ride in Venice, Italy. When you join the Seaging Cowboys, you will get to see much of the world like I did.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is it is lots of fun, especially after the animals have been unloaded.

It's not just working with animals, feeding, and watching over them. You have lots of fun playing games like baseball, volleyball, and boxing. You have lots of down time with the long trips there and back, and not having to care for animals on the way home after they are unloaded. It is a lot of fun being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Now are you thinking participating in the Seaging Cowboys program? It is a great opportunity and experience for anyone who wants to join. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity because, you get to help many people that are in need, see lots of the world and have great experiences, and have lots of fun. You really should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
