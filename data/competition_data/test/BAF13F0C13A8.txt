Electoral college unfair, outdated, and irrational. There are quirks and many disputes on outcome of votes, it is perfered by 60 percent of voters that there should be a direct election but the the big thing is that it needs to be placed there.

Its stated that their are many reasons to retain the Electoral College despite those reasons, Electoral College is there for ceranity of outcome. some say that the electoral college votes are not counted and that there is no need for it, but direct vote can lead to a president who has no real will to the state.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors with only 270 votes requiered to elect there is no need to worry about a tie. With the Electorial College still up and running there are no reasons for voting to fall apart each state is entitled allotment of electors this equals to the members in the Congressional delegation there is one each for the House of Representatives plus two for your senator.

For example the Electoral College is there to make sure that there is always a vote due to the fact that only one half of the eligible voters in florida actually votede in 2012. The people placed in the Electoral college are people who want to express a politaical preference so that there isnt a probblem of a single vote deciding the electon and no ties for another realecting,so its better off.

Another great example is the Electoral College is the best way to go is that Each canidate in your state has its own group of electors and each state has a law that varys on how electors are selected with there own responsability leaving it fully cappable of its duties to properly elect a president by populer vote with the use of fully qualified citizens. So Electoral college irrational or rational qualified and equiped keeping the despised method un voted.    Â
