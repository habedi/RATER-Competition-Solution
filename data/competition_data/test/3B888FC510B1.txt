Every year school gets harder for students, high school in particular is the hardest out of all. I believe students should have a choice on how they want to learn. Students should be able to choose weather or not getting an education from home or from the school is the best way for them to succeed. I think distance learning is helpful to certain students but, not all. It provides for a better mental health, better self-esteem, and improved attendance.

Majority of teenagers struggle with self-esteem, body confidence, and confidence in general. High school is a very judgmental atmosphere, the girls are mean, and the boys put on a front. Most of the kids do not feel safe coming to school without being judged by another group of students. In today's society every teenage girl wants an 'hourglass' body shape, but unless your last name is Kardashian it does not come naturally. Often girls starve themselves to technically fit into society's perfect body image. This causes girls to shame their own bodies as well as other high school girls, calling them "too fat", or "too skinny". Other times girls might try to be somebody they are not and compare their selves to another girl they may think is a definition of 'perfect', this may lead to personality changes, attitude changes, and character trait changes. Some students may not want to be around or in the high school environment due to self-esteem issues, which may lead to them needing distance learning which will provide a better environment for themselves.

Distance learning may provide students with a better mental health, most highschoolers face depression. Students may be bullied or feel like they have nobody in their corner for them when they are at school. Teenage boys feel like they need to hide their emotions and put on an act when they're at school. They may think that showing their emotions makes them not as 'manly' as they are told they need to be. This causes these high school boys to suffer in silence. At home students feel safer, they might have an adult at home with them that they can talk to, if they are feeling down or even a pet to lay with while they do their school work. It is proven that animals help with anxiety and help humans feel more at ease when they are stressed. Students don't have to worry about feeling judged or bullied at their own home. Overall distance learning will provide students with a chance of feeling like they are in a safer environment mentally, at home rather than being at school.

Distance learning will provide students with a better attendance record, students will be able to start later on the computer and end later. Providing students with a better nights of rest and letting students learn on their own time while staying within the curriculum. I know a lot of students struggle to make it to school on time or to even show up to school, including myself. Students may struggle to get to the bus on time or struggle to wake up when their alarm goes off. If students are already at home they have no reason to get ready or no bus to catch. If the students are aloud to begin their classes on their on time while following the schedule it will allow them not to feel as rushed as they would at school. In high school students have to run to their next class to make it on time where as if you were doing online school you may only have to go to the next tab, stay within that website, or even just open up a new word document. Therefore distance learning will help improve highschoolers attendance and tardiness.

You may be thinking. what if the student slacks off and does not complete their online courses? Well that is why I feel you have to be extremely responsible while doing distance learning, if you know you are a student who procrastinates or does not turn in stuff on time, attending school may be better for you. I believe that the student who is doing distance learning has to be responsible with their work and once they slack off it is mandatory to attend school until they prove they are capable of doing distance learning. There is always pros and cons to every situation but I feel that in this certain situation their are more pros if anything. Students should always have a choice in how they want to receive their education, I believe distance learning is the most effective and efficient way to learn.
