extracurricular Activities

Some principles decide that all of their students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. I agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because of a few reasons. First, all students can get the chance to participate in a sport. And the extracurricular activity you choose to participate in can prepare you for your future.

I think it is important for students to participate in sports because It gets you in better physical shape. And when you are in better shape you feel more confident in yourself which will make you more focused on your goals. And because you believe in yourself and you know you have the strength to keep pushing and you know you can reach those goals. and your heart and the rest of your body will become stronger. Several studies have proven that exercise is good for your mental heath and your hearts health. Which will make you live longer and be happier.

even though the school is making you participate in extracurricular activities you get to choose the extra curricular activity you want to participate in. You get to choose something you are passionate about and you will have fun doing. And it will be great practice if you want to grow up and do that for a living. If you are participating in an extracurricular activity and it is something you want to do when you grow up, you will be way more experienced then everyone else. And when you apply for a job your employer will see that you are more experienced and qualified then everyone else. For example, if I joined the Marine Biology club I would spend years learning and doing things marine biologists would do. So I would be experienced and have more practice then all of the other people who also want to be marine biologists. I will have the upper hand because I already know things they are just starting to learn about.

I agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because they can better prepare you for the future and be ahead of everyone else.
