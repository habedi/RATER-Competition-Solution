To Principal:

Students Should not be able to have or do community service if they where not convicted of a crime they committed in school of on school grounds.

Community service is understandable to me but its not fair to have students help out others if they weren't convicted of bad behavior an example to that u cant order a student to do community service for him/her for picking up trash another student dropped in the hallway.

In Addition to that students have the rite to do community service if not given to him/her but if community service is given then he/she should be punished for there actions but what did they do to deserve community service.

Some students should be punished for bad behavior, talking back, even just being plan out disrespectful to one another. But what they shouldn't have community service for is helping out another person when they are caught in the act of someone else being mean to him/her also being a good character to the school, classmates, teachers, staff and custodians if someone is not so you can show that person how to be respectful. An

How some should act at all times.

Maybe Staff and teachers like to punish us because of a ruff past they had growing up as a child that's not rite so they want to give us community service make us there little pets but that shouldn't be the answer to none of there problems.
