Cars that can drive themselves have been a fascination for many years, but exactly how safe are these "driverless cars?" Sure, not being in charge of drving your own car could be fun right? But, that is exactly the problem because you are not in control. The driverless car is just creating new paths of destruction. And sadly, I believe this new technology is more of a downfall, than a fun upgrade.

Not in control of drving can be very dangerous, even though many saftey aspects are taken into hand. For instance "Google cars arent truly driverless: they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues." And with trying to bring in car entertainment, "displays can be turned of instantly when the driver needs to take over." But being suddently alerted might not give someone enough time to take control of the situation! Plus, all of these statements call for the driver taking over at some point of time, because something is not safe for the car to do. Should'nt that say something?

Not only are driverless cars very unsafe, but they area also very expensive. Engineers at Berkeley tried using "magnets with alternating polarity" to create a smart-road. "But they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical." And would'nt this concept be the same for smart driverless cars? Think about it, manufacturers are making massive upgrades to existing cars. Bringing in a lot of brand new technology to create the driverless car, who could even afford one?

Your dreams may be crushed, driverless cars are just plain unaffordable, unreliable, dangerous, and pointless. And even though everyone is telling you not be afraid because with techonoolgy these cars can "mimic the skill of a human at the wheel", dont you see that technolgy is what they are relying on? Technology can be very unconsitent and risky, what "If the techonolgy faills and someone is injured?" A person should be with their hands on the wheels at all times and be in control, not technology. Because would you want sensors to be in charge of choosing your life?
