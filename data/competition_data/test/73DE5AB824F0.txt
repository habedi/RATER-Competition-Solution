You know what I hate about us students now a days I hate how we always want a short cut or a easier way of doing things. I think these projects that are assigned during the break should be teacher designed. I think teachers should create the projects instead of the students creating the projects because if we were to make the project the project would be easier and shorter and the students would all make they're projects the same which would enable cheating. If teachers are the ones that are designing the project they should make it where it is impossible for students to cheat and make the project cover the whole year like a recap.

One of the main reasons I think teachers should create the project instead of the students is because if students were to make the projects instead of the teachers the students would make the project so much easier. I know students would make the projects easier because I am a student myself. We would make the project so easy that all we have to do is search the question on Google and just write the answer down. I actually been in this position before we made our own projects and we searched the question on Google and wrote the answers down. All though it was easy and not time consuming I would rather actually do the work instead of cheat so I could learn the material.

lastly teachers should make the projects instead of the students is because we would design the project to make it easy for us to cheat like all having the same projects as other students or making the project similar to projects that are online already. Teachers should make the project unique and different forms of the project so we cant cheat off each other or the internet and actually learn the material. If teachers would make it impossible to cheat on the project the project will be a good way to assure they continue learning during their break.

Teachers should assign and create a project for their students for the break. It would be a good idea if the project consisted of the material they went through the whole year . It would also be a good idea if the teachers would make different forms of the projects so we would not be able to cheat off each other and make the project unique so we cant search the questions on Google. If the teachers would read this and consider applying what I suggested I think their students would be in a great shape to come back to school after break with new information on their subject.
