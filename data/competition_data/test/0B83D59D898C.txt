Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that the first one is better because the principal will allow us students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch, as long as there turned off during class.

We should be able to use them during lunch just incase of an emergence.

Like if a robbery came with guns we could take a picture of them as long as they don't see you do that.

The free time part is good to because we could play games on there phone or when we have free time we could still learn by our phones by downloading apps to the phone for chemical equations for science or math or something like that.

If a robbery came what would you do if you had a phone while in the lunch room take a picture of who the suspect is unless they have a mask on then the school cafeteria would catch on the camera.
