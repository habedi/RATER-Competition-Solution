Dear Principal,

I think students should be required to perform community service because it does them good. Also if they don't want to do community service you will have a little talk with them. Also it is nice to do community service for your town or community. Also even though I have done community service in my town I would really like to show the students what helping the community is like. If they don't like doing community service they don't have to do ever again. Unless they get in trouble. Then they would have to do community service. For example for community service is cleaning up the streets when they have garbage on them. Also put pretty flowers in your village park. Also you can clean some buildings and also paint them whatever color you want. Also the students should pick up litter if they find it anywhere. Also doing community service would go on your college application.

Sincerely Yours,
