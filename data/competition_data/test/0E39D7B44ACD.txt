One of the leading causes of distracted driving is Texting and Driving. 26% of all car crashes happen while texting and driving, also texting and driving is the number one leading cause of death in teens. 31% of people in the united states that text and drive. Nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are also injured every day due to texting and driving. More than 42% of teens admit that they text and drive. Texting and driving, makes you take your hand of the steering wheel, your eyes off the road and takes away the point of safe driving. Anything could happen with only one text message like car crashes or hitting someone or both. Teens that drive with someone else in the car could be even more distracting than texting and driving, because usually people who have more people in the car don't focus on the road and most likely won't wear a seatbelt. People usually use their phone in a car to change a music station, searching the web, updating social media and texting.

Texting and Driving has been illegal since November 1st, 2015, if caught texting and driving you could serve prison time, license suspension, fines and higher auto insurance. You could serve up to 30 days in prison for using your phone on the road. Texting and Driving is a habit and there are some apps parents could use to monitor the amount off miles, notification blocking and text and call blocking. Some phones are programmed to not allow access while driving but it doesn't mean people still can't get on their phones, usually phones have a notification and asks if you're a passenger and if you hit yes, you could still use your phone. The Newest iPhones are trying to get people to stay off their phones while driving by not allowing to let drivers access their phone. Most newer cars have a button where you could make calls through the car instead of picking up your phone to text someone.

Although people will never stop texting, I believe there is a way to minimize cell phone use while driving. By putting your phone out of reach for people to get tempted to turn on their phone and it will minimize the habit of using phones. Also by turning the phone on silent, so the person driving doesn't hear it and want to pick it up to check and see what it is. People should learn to break their habits from their phones, most people who see or hear their phone then they pick it up. While on the road, everyone wants for everyone else to drive safe so they could get to point A to point B without getting a crash by unsafe drivers, so I believe if everyone wants to remain safe and to get to their destination, they should just not use it while driving. More ways to not be distracted on the roads are keeping the radio on one station, turning their phone off while driving and driving without passengers.
