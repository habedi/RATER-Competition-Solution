Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Cell phones are simply too distracting even for the most talented enough most experienced driver enough to drive and chew gum. I feel like Unless Bluetooth is built into the car and designed to operate as a vehicle accessory much like a radio or windshield washer control I done see a problem with being on the phone while driving because it is hands free.

But we are being our own worst enemies when it comes to driving while on the phone it is Hard to that everyone knows at least one accident caused by using a cell phone while driving even if you can walk and chew gum at the same time, gum chewing is an unconscious activity. Talking on a phone and driving are not. People who think they are as alert talking on a cell phone and driving are probably the same people who think one, two or three drinks doesn't dumb down their driving skills.

I follow many drivers, of all ages, who start slowing down considerably or start swerving in traffic and there are not even young like me they are older people that could be the age of my parents that are driving reckless while on the phone like when they are looking for their phones to answer them, to call someone, or to text someone. This causes braking from everyone else that causes unnecessary crashes from everyone else. Cell phone use and driving is a distraction no matter who is doing it. I it doesn't matter how many years' experience that person has driving. You are not going to drive a car while talking on a cell phone in drivers ed, so why do it on the road with real citizens not cones? Next time you're talking on a cell phone and driving, once you hang up, try remembering how many stop lights you just went thru.
