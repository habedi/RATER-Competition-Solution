Dear principle,

Well I think that it would be a good idea to change the sport participation grade to a B average. Why? well because that is a major help when it comes to grades. one reason why is because the students what to play sports, and if they do not have reasonable grades then some are not eligible to play. that could also effect lazy ones who don't try and turn there work in on time, because if they wanted to play a sport he or she would not be able to. so there is one reason why i think that you should change the grade point average to a b instead of a c.

another reason is, well if you look around and see all of the children in the school and how many in here play sports. and then think to your self and you would problem say to yourself "that could be a lot of grate grades. i know from personal experience, because i played a sport and i got kicked off of the team because of my grades, and that motivated me a whole lot to start doing good then i brought my grades up and got back on the team. so you can see that student all want to play sports and so i think that it would be a good idea to change the average.

so that is what i think about changing the grade
