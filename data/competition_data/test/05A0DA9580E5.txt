Dear Editor,

I think the possible policy change of students not participating in sports or other activities unless they have a B average is not fair. I don't think its fair because students try really hard sometimes on keeping their grades up and not down. sometimes the students don't deserve the grade they get because the teachers make mistakes sometimes and give you a bad grade when you really don't deserve that grade. Like for example if you did your homework and you give it to the teacher the next day then the teacher puts it away when she collects everybodys homework. Then after she tells you to give her your homework but you already did,so you tell her that you already gave it to her but she doesn't believe you so she just gives you a 0 for your work. And i don't think that's fair because a lot of students work very hard on their homework,sometimes they even stay up late doing their homework just bacause they don't want a bad grade on it. Also I don't think its fair because you cant just keep everybody from playing sports or doing activities because that's one way everybody can have fun and entertain themselves. Sports and doing activities are a good way to keep you from getting bored. Their also a part of school so they involve gym and doing exercise. Last I would like to say that I relly don't think that's a way to solve everything. I think you should come up with a better plan than this .A lot of the students might get very mad or dissapointed to hear the new policy that you guys are coming up with. So please think about what you guys are planing to do,think very carefully. I hope I was able to change your mind. Thats all I have to say for now goodbye and it was very nice having this conversation with you.
