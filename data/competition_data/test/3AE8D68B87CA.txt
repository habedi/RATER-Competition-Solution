Dear principal,

I am writing to you about the topic of community service. I stand by the option of requiring students to do community service. I have many arguments for this topic. It would make the students better people, they would help their community, and make the student feel more grateful. Let me explain to you my reasons for a requirement on community service.

Doing community service would benefit the way a students acts. For example, community service will help make the student a better person. They will learn to care for others and not just themselves. They will also be healthier. Instead of sitting indoors all day the students would be outside helping others, being active. This is how community service would make students better people.

Doing community service will greatly help the community. If all students were required to do community service then they will help improve the way their community works. If the local stores and centers don't have volunteers then they will get almost nothing done. They can't hire a bunch of people either because then they won't make enough money to support themselves. But if students are required to do community service then there will be a never ending supply of volunteers. This is how community service will help the community.

Doing community service will make students appreciate what they have making them more grateful. By doing community service the student will learn not to take advantage of things like money and food. If they help set up a homeless shelter and see how many people have to go possibly days without food. It will make the student care more for what they have and never take advantage of it again.

Some students may disagree with community service as a requirement. They may say that they have important things they have to do at home or at school. Well they don't have to do the work every single day. They can do it whenever they're free. The students should only need to do so many hours a year, but more hours is always better. So don't worry if you're busy, you have plenty of time to help your community.

Those are my reasons for a requirement on community service for students. It will make the student a better person. It will help make the community a better place. And it will make the student more appreciative and grateful of what they have. Now please pass this requirement for the sake of our community.

Sincerely,

A fellow student.
