The using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable thing. Acorrding to the article, it says, "A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This shows that it can help the student make sure they understand the lesson the teachers teachings. It can also help the teacher see what they nedd to explain more, or what the students are getting stuck on. The article also says, "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This helps me explain on what i was saying, that it could help the teachers modify the lesson so the students can understand more of the lesson.

This technology can help the students and the teacher to strat communicating even more now. It can show the teacher how a student feels about somethinbg the teacher is doing. Also, it can help the teacher see if the student has something going on in thier life that they are not doing thier work. That way the teacher can ask whats going on to the student. It can maybe lower the chances of the students failing thier class. This can help the student go on to collage, so the percent of students going to collage would go higher.

How do you know that's this technology could be helping students pass thier classes? What it this is the key for all humans to get smarter? These are thing that we should be thinking about. If we would of hev it already, think about how far we could be right now with technology. Just think about how many docters, or laweyers and all those important people we need. Not just that but world peaces. the most thing people wish we could have. peace amoung all humanity.

Well that's what it think about if we had thats type of technology. I agree that we should have this type of technology in the schools. It will help the teacher to find other ways to teach, or other way to make thing easier for the students. It also, help the kids learn faster, and also understand the lesson.
