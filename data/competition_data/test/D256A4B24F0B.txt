Dear Principals,

You know how these texting in class and calling and being not responsible... Well I think that policy 2 is the best policy. This reason is because students can be more focused on their work more than phones , students want be distracting other kids , and most importantly is that they need to have a good GED when they get in high school. I think we should have a election. I know back in a few grades I used to text and everything but I have learned my lesson. I have had bad grades and you don't want that. But the main thing im trying to get to here is that, texting should not be allowed in class like what policy two said. I think that is jus plain dumb. Im just trying to persuade you to not let texting go on during class. Also im conserned about my other class mates.

Well I hope if anyone else writes you . That they feel the same way I do . Well got to get back to my school work. That is what's best for me!

Your Friend, STUDENT_NAME
