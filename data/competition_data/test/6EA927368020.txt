Dear TEACHER_NAME

I don't think you should make community service mandatory.

There are a few reasons why i think it shouldn't be mandatory.

I'll give some examples with my thoughts.

And I'm sure there are others how agree with me.

I think community service is a good thing but it shouldn't be mandatory for couple of reasons. For instance, a lot of students don't a lot time after school to take part in community service.

For example, many students have after school activities such sports, tutoring, and homer work club. On top pf all that, there's home work and chores for students to do.

Another reason is some parents might not wont there child in community service. They might not wont their child to leave their house after a certain time. Or maybe their child has an early bed time. Some parents just might not agree with community service anyway.

These are just some the reasons why community service shouldn't be mandatory. There are more reasons why it shouldn't be mandatory to. That's why i that's why i think community service shouldn't be mandatory.

sincerely,
