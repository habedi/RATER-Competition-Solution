Dear Principle,

I had just heard you are thinking about changing the grade to play sports to a B. I think this is not the best idea. Many students have problems at home, where projects and homework cannot be done, bringing their grade down a lot. Sports are what a lot of students depend on in school, as an after-school activity, a hobby, or even a profession. Most students are able to maintain an A or B average, but for some its just to much.

I understand that being able to play a sport is a privilege, and to earn a privilege you must do give something back. Having a C isn't bad, its average, and that's the best that some kids can do no matter how hard they try.

I think a C average is fine, and a B might be a little to much.

Another reason I don't think this is a very good idea is because for some kids being able to stay after school is a good way to meet new people and get away from whatever is happening at home that might be bothering them.

Another thing you might consider doing is, if a student doesn't get a high C, B, or higher on a test or exam they have to do something at practice, or not get as much playing time as the players that get good grades.

Thank you for your time, and I hope you choose what is best for the school.

Sincerely,
