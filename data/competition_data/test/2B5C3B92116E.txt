Phones and Driving

In today's current society almost everyone in the world has access or owns a cellular device. That device that can call text or email right from your pocket. While it is so very useful it can also become quite distracting to someone who might be driving. Which leads to the point that Drivers should not be able to access their phones while driving. In these cases its smart to look at the annual driver and cell phone related instances that have happened over the years as well as the averages of crashes involving phones and the driver.

Cell Phone users while they are driving are 5.36 times more likely to get into an accident when driving accordion to a study done at the University of Utah ("Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks." University of Utah News, archive. unews. utah. edu/news_releases/drivers-on-cell-phones-are-as-bad-as-drunks/). These statistics show how more likely a driver is to get in an accident while on their cell phones. That isn't a small number 5.36 is a larger number of people when taking into account how many use their phones while driving anyways. This leads into how many people actually die to chances like these.

In 2015 alone there were 3,477 people killed in a distracted driver accident. 476 of which in those cases were cell phone users.("Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving." EndDD, www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoaz3BRDnARIsAF1RfLevzm7d8WG_o9fmbSLCDrfzuhq4pSz6LYGnFCL65o0N-OBsj-T8u8YaAh1_EALw_wcB.). These numbers when taking into account how those deaths could have been prevented by simply putting the phone down while driving are extremely high. That is 13 percent of all drivers that died last year were on their phones. And those people would still be alive had they put the phone down.

These statistics do not lie when saying how people die due to cellular phones being used while driving. With that when 13 percent of the annual driving related deaths are all cellphone based and with the ever growing world that number will go up. That is unless the Driver puts the phone downs while he drives.
