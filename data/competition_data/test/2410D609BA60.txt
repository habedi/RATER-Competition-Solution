I am agianst of useing technolgy to read to students cause when they do they just scan threw the stuff they never explain what happen how it happen and what was left of everything. and it also reads fast to you sometimes also. Then another reason is because if the kids got stuff read to them everytime how are they going to think how the book or article is about they need to read it on there own so they can understand whats going on every second threw the book or article they are reading id u let technology take over reading how are we going to learn make kids read the books and articles and they will have fun doing it.

This is were i got the evendince from to support my awnser were i got it from is pargraph three why. Because they had computers involed saying they made this thing called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) what is does is makes a human face takes it to the computer and put it on there like a real face and it put expresions and muslces in the face to make it very real looking. I think its neat but what are we learning here. Nothing cause no body really cares about it except computer geeks and gamers its a waste of our time we could be useing to do help full thing like saving people and feeding the homeless in this world, or getting a job or creating something better or full filling your dreams.

To sum this thing all up is. Lets make the kids read there own books and articles cause they will learn something new everyday, not bye letting technology read to them let them read so they can under stand and learn cool boring things so they can go home and tell mom,dad,grandma, and grandpa what they learned today. Take technology out of reading and put yourkids into it.
