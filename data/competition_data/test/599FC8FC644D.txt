The object in the picture is not an alien artifact, because land forms on mars that look funny are caused by shadows, the picture quality was not good, and the camera on the last time could of saw buildings and even planes.

The object in the picture was not a alien artifact, because the land on mars has many hills called Martian mesa. A Martian mesa is like a sand dune it is mound of sand and dirt, so for this to be a alien artifact is very unlikely. These mesas are very common on mars, because it says,"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia." This shows that it was just another mound of sand and dirt that had a wierd shadow that made it look like a face.

The second piece of evidence is that, the picture quality was not very clear in the first two pictures. In the first picture they did not have very high HD cameras like they did in 2001. In the first picture it is very blurry and not clear witch gave it the look of a face. In the second picture it was a cloudy day and the picture did not come in clear, still giving it the look of a face. In the last picture it was a perfect day for it and scientest had the camera ready they zoomed it in all the way and where ready for the picture, and when they looked at it it showed nothing but a dirt mound.

The last piece of evidence is that on the last time to the picture could of shown buildings, roads etc. In the last picture the camera scientest where using could of picked up any small buildings, roads, and any that was close to it, but it did not. This means that their is no life on mars to create a mound that looks like a face. Their for their is no alien life on mars.

The evidence shows states that their is no alien life on mars and that it was just a bad picture along with a mound the caused a wierd shadow that caused this look of a face.
