Schools are a place where students can interact with each other and can learn useful skills. Schools sound great but there are some negatives about the school environment such as bullying, sickness, and being uncomfortable in a large crowded classroom. One solution to several of these issues is for students to have the ability to take online classes or video conferencing from home. While many skeptics might call this is a bad idea, I believe this is a great idea. This would solve several key issues today and make school a much better environment for the students to be able to succeed.

Schools are a great place for many students to make friends and to have fun hanging out with their peers. This doesn't happen to be the case for everyone though, some students just have a hard time making friends and find school isn't enjoyable. Some students just get put in classes with none of their friends and have to wait till after school to have fun with their peers. This is where having online classes would be a great option for many students. Those students could meet up with their friends and help each other to learn while taking online classes. This would also lower overall depression of students and would make school enjoyable for many students.

Another issue that partially co insides with the last is students being uncomfortable in stiff plastic seats and in crowded classrooms. Some students don't like to sit for long periods or just find the stiff plastic seats in school to be uncomfortable. This is why being able to take classes from home whether on a video conference or just online would benefit many. Students could stand up and move around home while they attend their classes and others could sit in their comfortable soft chairs at home. Also some kids simply don't like to be in large crowded areas such as the classroom and would greatly benefit from attending class from home. I think students need to be able to feel comfortable when learning. For example if a student is in a classroom that is cold it can impact the students ability to learn simply because humans have a harder time trying to function at cold temperatures, same goes at high temperatures. This is why comfort is a vital part of being able to learn.

The last issue is sickness which affects every student. Sickness affects students physically but also affects their ability to learn. Whether its because of students missing school or not being able to function mentally, sickness affects everyone. This is why having the ability to attend classes from home would benefit every student. Students could be sick with a cough for example and not want to miss important classes so they go to school and they can end up getting others sick which would affect more kids from learning. With online classes or video conferencing someone could be sick and stay home and still get the important information from class without infecting others. This would solve the sickness issue all together, lower depression, and eliminate students from having to catch up.

These are the reasons why I believe every student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe every school needs to implement a system for students to be able to take classes from home. This would solve the sickness, comfort, and friends issue that is in every school today. It would also lower depression of students who feel pressure at school. With everything I have mentioned I only see advantages and benefits for students to have a better learning experience.
