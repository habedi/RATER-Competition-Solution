Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME

and i think our principal should let us bring our cell phone to school..

The reasons he should let use bring them to school is for emergency say if the school was on fire and what if someone ride's the bus and the bus broke down and we can call our parent's to come get us off the bus or we can call our parent and tell the what happen to us but other then that he should allow us to use our cell phone during lunch time and free time but after them times they should be turned off and put up so we can not use them that is what i think is should be like and SCHOOL_NAME that is all i want from our principal just let us use them ant lunch time and free time that all i really want from him. and walking to our class we should be able to use them and i believe in policy 1. Because is will make the students more happy than they is today and they want have to sneak and use them so that is what i believe he should let use do at this school that's all i want him to let us do for now on
