Dear Principal,

I have heard about your new policy regarding, who can participate in sports.

I believe, that making sports only available to grade B average students is a great idea.

Many students who participate in sports don't believe that it is important to keep their grades up because, they are focused only on their sports.

School sports are very time consuming and can affect a students sleep and amount of time allowed to spend on homework.

Practices after school can take away from homework time and force students to start your homework late at night.

It depends on the student to decide what is more important homework or sleep?

Having games is a whole other story, sports games are usually in the evening and if you live far from school this can prove to be a problem for many students.

By the time you arrive at your home it could already be ten o'clock and this will definitely affect your sleep.

If, only grade B average students were allowed to participate, students who participate in sports programs would push themselves to academic excellence.

With more students trying hard to succeed in their studies, the school would become a smarter place.

also, since many of the students only have a C average the will be motivated to raise their grades in school.

Our school would benefit from this new policy and the students attending would too.

I am sure that teachers would also enjoy their students working harder and participating more in class.

Signed,

A concerned student
