Valubale FACS Technology in the Classroom

FACS is an acronym for the new technology named Facial Action Coding System. It enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is quite interesting and also complex. Dr. Huang predicts "A classroom computer could recognnize when a student is becoming confused or bored". He says that by knowing that we as students are bored the computer would "modify the the lesson like an effective human instructor."

I believe that FACS, the new technology of facial action coding, would be very effective and valuable in the classroom. I know that as a student reading a so called "never ending" article causes me to become sleepy and uninterested. With the modification of the lesson, I think that it will enhance the attention given to the lesson. Students are struggling so much as ADD and ADHD seem to have been on the rise or rather the diagnoses or those things. Students become uninterested when they don't think that it will benefit them or their future and when they have to read a lot of material that's dry. If attention to the lesson is heightened grades will more than likely raise as heighten as well.

In conclusion, I believe that a Facial Action Coding System would be nice to have in the classroom and would bring a lot more interest back into school work. At the end of the article the author stated "Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!" That being said, I think that another claim could be "Whoever thought that making faces finally worked after all these years and we get someone who cares enough to make our lessons interesting". So many students around me and I know that other students in other areas don't even care about school anymore because they don't feel that their opinion about what they learn matters and it's sad that a computer software program has to do it instead of our leaders and teachers but as long as we get what we need and as long and our grades go up I find this FAC system to be amazing software to put into the school systems.
