Not all students should have to do community service because they might have things to do, and wont have enough time to do community service. If the students like doing community service then the principal should let those students have a club were they can do stuff for the community. So those students can then do what they like. It makes it better to so the people in charge of the club can watch the students to see that they are actually doing community service. as for if the principle made every student do community service they might not have time to do homework or have time for other things. Another thing the students might do is just lie about it. They can just tell the principal that they did community service when they really didn't. So then it would just end up being a waste of time. Soon every one will start lying about it because it will start to get annoying and nobody is going to want to do it. This is y not all students should do community service.
