Luke believe's people should join the seagoing cowboy's program and so do i. And you should because if you do you help people. You get to see great places like china. You get to see alot of great things like the acropolis in greece. And you even get to see Europe

I know all this because the text says. But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. It opened up the world to him. "i'm grateful for the oppurtunity he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their need's.

Another reason is the text says. It took about two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states. And a month to get to china. It also says Besides helping people. I had the benifet of seeing europe.

The text also says But seeing Acropolis in greece was special he says. It also says Luke turned 18 before ariving in greece. It also says so was taking a gondola ride in venice italy. A city with streets of water those are a few of the things to do. And it also states To help these countries recover their food suplies animals and more 44 nation's joined together.

That is why people should join the seagoing cowboy's program. You get to help people in the darkest times. Like after war when they have almost no food. You get to go to beatiful places and see beatiful things. Like china the Acropolis in greece Italy Europe. This is why people should join the seagoing cowboys program.
