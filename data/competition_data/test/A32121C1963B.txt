Many peeple own a car and later one more will but the car usage is limited. Some familys just want two or three cars or the insucre dont want the same people having to many cars on their name because it can caused a problem. A car owner iwll buy a space for $40,000 just for it car or cars

In the world like 70% of the families dont own a car at least not even one. And at least 57% sold a car to move somewhere because they need the money. In paris 4,000 drivers where fined with a 22-euro fine($31) because they had old lisnce plates and they had thier car impount because of the way they reacted to the fine. In the U.S.A had a uniqiu car culture because it buiold the model-t car in detriot

But in April 2005 had low milages meaning not many people used cas that much or didnt own that much cars but in April 2013 the number of miles was increased by 9% and that nine percent is getting bigger and bigger because we are now having teenagers owning their lelinces and they will want a car for them selfs. So this will take the 9% even higher each year
