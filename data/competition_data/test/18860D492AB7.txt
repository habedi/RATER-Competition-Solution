Principle

I think that policy 1 is a policy you could consider allowing us to use. Our cell phones being used during lunch and as long as we have our phones off during class. Because students should have a little freedom as long as we can be controlled. And it would be a privilege to be able to use them during lunch. Or may be you can let us use them on Fridays if we don't have any iss, referrals, or stuff like that. And maybe you can mix in both policy's but still give us a privilege to have some fun at the same time. You can also have it as a award as like when we do something good when you hand out those 200 tickets the award should be for that person to be able to use there electronics during lunch. i think the students in the campus would really like this idea.

But then again there is a down hill to this kids will not always follow these rules. So once these rules are broken that individual should not have the privilege to use his or hers electronics. But the whole group of students should not be punished because of one or a more students.
