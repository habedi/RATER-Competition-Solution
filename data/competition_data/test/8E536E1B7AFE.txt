Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? I think it should be teacher-designed because they came up with this idea so, they should have some designs thought of another reason why i think it should be teacher designed is that teachers have more experince of doing projects then students so, they should have alot of examples of projects for students to do and the last reason is students are on summer break if the students have to think of design to do they probably will forget or not do it but if a teacher gives them the design of the project to do they will do it quick and then enjoy there summer break.

Firstly, the teachers came up with this idea of giving students a summer project so, they can contine learning durning their break they should have some designs for the students for their projects. For example, my brother and I work at kroger and when we are off work our job still want us to be good citizens so they sign us up to feed the homeless and bring clothes to the shelters. Our job want my brother and i be good citizens at all times so, they gives us examples how to show them that we are good citizens.

Secondly, teachers have more experince then students at projects so, they should have designs thought of for students. For example, my father was a boyscout member for 5 years and he know how to make different types of toy cars so, i had a project at school i had to design a toy car and my dad had experince at toy cars so he gave me alot of designs to do and i did the easiest one. People who have experince can help the other person who doesn't have no experinceat at all.

Lastly, it is summer break students don't think about school if the students have to think of a design to do they will not do it but if the teacher give them a design for the project the students will do it quick for they can enjoy there sumer break. For example, Im a student at Generic_School if we had to design a project on summer break and i had to come with a design it would not have been done because we on summer break i don't think about school but if a teacher gives me a design i will to do it on first day of summer so, i don't have worry about the project trust me alot of students think a like so they will do the same some students don't even do home work and you think they will do a summer project.

The teacher should design the project because they came up with idea so,they should have some designs, they have more experince then students at projects so they should have alot of designs to share, students are on summer break if they have to come up with a design they will not do it. If we had to this at my school nobody will do it because we don't think about work whatever school does this is a bad school.
