I think that people should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because you can take care of horses, young cows, and mules that wereshipped overseas.

My first reason is that in August 1945, the recieved their orders to report the New Orleans. They arrived August 14, the day the Pacificcwar ended. They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

My second reason is that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. It tooko about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

My final reason is that I would go because I love horses and mules. Horses are so cozy and fluffy to me. Mules are entertaining to me as well as Horses too. They are to adorable and huge.

That's why I would want to go. I would want to touch Horses and Mules.
