Principal makes kids do extracurricular activities. I sorry but I'm going to disagree on this one because, parents work and most of the activities have after school stuff so parents that don't get off in time can not pick them up from it. Plus students are given home work to do,so if they do there sports and things how are they going to do homework. my third reason is that sports and activities sometimes cost money to get into,like the club would want you to pay dues.

Next is the activities when kids do them it takes there learning time away. Plus the in sports can be hard to get into. And sometimes you have to have certain requirements to play ,and some people can't make those requirements. But theres also a due that people have to pay so thats why some parents don't let there kids play sports.

Finally the conclusion is that the principal should not make kids do sports or join a club ,because it is a hard time for the parents and the kids to do a sport and worry about a different thing. So some school should not make a students do something that they don't want to do. And the last thing I want to say is that you should never force a student to do something that they don't want to do.
