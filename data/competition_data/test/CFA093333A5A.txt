Phones and Driving

Americans have fallen in love with cell phones. They love the easy access of talking with loved ones, the taking of selfies at any time and the excitement of scrolling through and interacting with friends on social media. Cell phones have really made life for the American people a joyous and exciting occasion; until they get behind the wheel of a car. Loss of life, driving privileges taken away, and getting a ticket are all common problems that cell phones use when driving present.

Causing an accident and killing yourself or another person is a very real situation you can face when using the cell phone and driving. There is nothing wrong with talking all day and night to family and friends on the cell phone. The problems come when you decide to take the phone conversation into the vehicle while driving. One of the problems is distracted driving and taking your eyes off the road. Taking your eyes off the road is dangerous because in a split second you can have an accident and kill yourself or another person.

If you get into a serious accident, you may lose your privilege to drive your vehicle. The common behavior of texting and driving is similar to a person that has been drinking and decides to drive a vehicle. This behavior is dangerous, reckless, and an accident waiting to happen. Your eyes are supposed to be focused and alert on the road; not in your phone. If you recieve multiple tickets for driving while using your phone, there is a chance that your driving privileges could be taken away. To get back the privileges to drive again could cost a lot of money and time. Being able to drive is a privilege and losing that privilege is not worth losing due to a social media status update.

In the state of Georgia you are not allowed to text and drive, if you are caught texting while driving you will receive a ticket. People who text and drive are putting their lives and other people's lives at risk. In order to prevent the 1 out of 4 car accidents in the United States from texting and driving, there must be more laws put in place. We must continue pushing the hands free law to save more lives and help keep the roads safe.

As of today, getting a ticket, risking the loss of driving privileges, and even taking a chance of causing a death has not stopped drivers from using their phones while driving. It is exciting to take the perfect selfie and update your social media status on the go, however those are some of the things that should not be done while driving. Distractions from using cell phones while driving have become very dangerous and caused our roads to be unsafe. In order to drive you must follow the driving rules and understand that tragic events can be caused by using cell phones and driving at the same time. So for the reasons I explained in this paper, I don't think individuals should be allowed to drive and use a cell phone in any state in america.
