Based on the information read we should change to election by popular vote. You can understand this by reading scource three paragraph fifteen. "When you vote for the presidential candidate yuo are actually voting for a slate of electors". This means you are voting for someone to vote for you.

In addition, the elctoral college should not remain active. You can better understand this in scource two paragraph eleven. "the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the desaster factor.", and goes on to state, "the 2000 fiasco was the biggest crisis in the century; the system alows for much worse." which also means that it could happen again and twice as bad.

Secondly, contrary to some belief, the electoral college can vote against you. One can find this information in scource two paragraph eleven. "Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those elctors could always defy the will of the people. Which simply means that the elctor could vote completly oposite of you.

In conclusion, the elction by popular vote is the best way to go. this is because the voters choice then does really count.
