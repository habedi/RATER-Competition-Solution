Have you ever thought about a computer reading your emotions? me neither, that sounds pretty cool huh. Well today its possible for your emotions to be read by new technology called "the Facial Action Coding System" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, this allows computers to recognize human emotions. I believe that this new technology can change things and improve the relationship between computers and humans.

Now lets take it back to Leonardo da Vinci and his Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help him paint muscles on the face as precisely as possible to show specific emotions. This painting was the first to be tested on this new software, yes a painting not real physical human face. The result showed hat Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The whole process of calculating emotions begins with a computer constructed 3-D model of the being identified, the 44 important muscles have to move like human muscles. the movement of one or muscles is called a "action unit".

Dr. Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are; Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Dr. Haung says in this passage that "the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)". humans calculate emotions everyday, you can tell when your friend is mad, sad, tired just by looking at their face. but not everyone can some people have trouble reading facial expressions on people.

Think about a computer knowing your exact emotion. For example when your doing an assignment that requires you to do research and the computer can tell that your getting bored with the website that you found by indentifiying your emotions at the moment, it could give you other sites that might interest you.
