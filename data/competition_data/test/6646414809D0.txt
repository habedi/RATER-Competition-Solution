Dear Principle,

When it comes to community service there are many opinions. Some people may think it's a waste of time, others may believe that everyone should participate. Community service helps everyone including ourselves. For example if we help repaint a local play ground then everyone could enjoy a place were people go to relax and have fun with their children. People don't go to a park to look at graffiti.

Community service may be a choice but if students were required to perform community service then the students may be able to see what they're doing for their community. A majority of students would be upset if it would be held after school and many parents and staff would be upset if it was held during school hours.

I believe that school should make a hour for students to do community service that could benefit the school if possible. If community service was held during school for the school I think that many people would be able to agree that it would benefit almost every one. Students would learn to appreciate what our parents are paying for with their taxes and the nice school that we have, the staff wouldn't have to go around covering up graffiti in our bathrooms that students made, and our parents would be happy that we put aside other things to help out our community. So if you would make it a requirement for us to do community service then many people will be thankful for just the little change you made that helped a wide range of people.

Sincerely,
