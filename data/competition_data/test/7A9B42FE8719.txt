To the Principle:

Many students have a grade C average. If the policies state that students must have a grade B average, how will the students be able to play the sport or activity they want to?

Also, if a student has a 79% which is just a point below a grade B, then the teachers, principles, or coaches would make them quit. I don't see any reason for them to have to quit the sport or activity they enjoy participating in just for being one point under a B.

For example, if there were 10 kids, lets say that all of them currently participate in a sport. 7 of them have a grade C average, that would mean that more than half of them would have to quit the team. That would result in the sport having to quit for not having enough of team members. My point is that I think students should have at least a grade C point average to be able to participate in activities and sports, so that we wouldn't have to ruin our sports teams and activity organizations because of teachers making the members or participants quit for not having a grade B average. We don't want our teams and activities to have to give up what they accomplished because the teacher wants them to have a better grade. Some students aren't that equipped or qualified to reach a B, so they end up with a C. If that student wants to play a sport and the policy was that you had to have a grade b average he would have to quit then he would be stressed to bring up his grade so that he could go back to whatever sport or activity he was involved in. That is my view on the possible policy change.
