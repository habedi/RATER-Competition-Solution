There has been a large argument about the "Face on Mars". This "Face on Mars" is located in a region called Cydonia, where martian mesas are commmon. It has gain a lot of attention from conspiracy theorist that belive there is life on Mars, and they belive an alien life form has created the face. While scientist are positive, that this is a natural landform like you see on Earth. However, conspiracy theorists ignore what the scientists say.

If aliens had created a monument that looked like humans, how would they know what we look like in the first place? We have not seen or proven that there is life on Mars, and if they knew what we looked like, wouldn't we know what they look like? Many conpsiracy theriosts argue that NASA wants to keep aliens a secret, but NASA would love to find an ancient civilization on Mars. If they could find an ancient civilization that could be a break through in science and biology.

When they took another picture in April 1998, the picture was taken with clouds in the sky, making it impossible to see the small things. The theriosts argue that they couldn't see anything, so on April 8, 2001 they took another picture. It was a cloudless day in the Cydonia region. They took aother picture of the phenomeun in full resolution, and that picture proves that the face is just a mesa or butte. The landform was even common in the United States.

Many conspiracy theorists was wishing for this to be a momunment from an anicent civilization, but the facts are agaist it. In the high resolution picture you can see the crevices in the land that make up the lanform. With the ditches and holes in the land, it causes shadows that reemble the eyes, nose, and mouth of a human. NASA would be happy to find an ancient civilization on Mars, but they look to the information first.
