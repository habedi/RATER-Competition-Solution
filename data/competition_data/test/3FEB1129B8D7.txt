Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, students can enjoy their summer break without any stress, teachers are making things like posters for the new school year, and school staff wanted students to have a long good break until some day in August of each year. For example, if students were given a summer project it would ruin their summer break and makes some kids angry.

Teachers would have to help their school have more decorations and make their school hallways look nicer. The teachers would also learn things they have to teach students what is it about and students can put their brains at a high level of knowledge once they come back from summer break.

In conclusion, teachers should do summer projects to support their school because, students would not have to deal with work during their summer break, the school would be ready for the first day after summer break, and getting students ready to learn something new when their summer break is over.
