The pursuit of the dangers includethings such as gravity,temperature,air pressure. The gravity because of in paragraph 5 the author made an example to a vehicle probably a space rover hovering above the surface. The text states that "Just like jet airlplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms,a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions but staying up and out of there way". Bascaily saying that the vehicle would have hard time to stay on the ground. The temperature would be as The text states in paragraph 5 "around 170 degrees fahrenheit". Temperatures would be scoiling hot. Air pressure would be another danger because you can only take so much pressure before you got to back to the surface. As the text states it once again in paragraph 5 " would be close to sea level ". I do agree with the author as he says in the text "Not easy conditions,but survivable for humans. There has been some movies about living on harsh conditions where astronauts had to live on planets with harsh conditions. So I do understand where the author is coming from that it could be possible if earth does die off and we are stuck to move to venus. In conclusion we are humans we have been everything from adam and eve to hilter taking over germany and forming the once all-mighty nazis to people getting mass murders in chicago to trump bulidng a wall. If humans been to that I think we can survive living on venus.
