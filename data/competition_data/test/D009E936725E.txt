I would claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. i would like to help students with their problems like anger depresson and what ever they have. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would help with students' emotions. This software could indentify any emotion you have and the face exprestions you have and it would calculate ever days feeling.

First, it would indentify any emotion you have. Just like Mona Lisa they found out that she was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. "The facial expressiions for each emotion are universal,"abserves Dr. Huang, "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"(like not smiling as broadly). Dr. Huang used video imagery, and tracked the new emotion-recognition software and the facial movements. In the real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece) by weighting the different units in every expression is against a neutral face (showing no emotion)"

Finally, calculating your emotions. Are you asking yourself if the software can calculate emotiond like math homework? This process begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. The forty-four muscles in the modle mus move like human muscles. Dr. pual Ecjman has classified some basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with chracteristic movements of the facial muscles. An example they give is, "Your frontalis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youre surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger." Its pretty intrusting how it can determined your emotions.

My conclusion is that the technology to the software would be a great thing to use because it would helpin so many emotions and it would help students in so many ways. I think its intrusting in how Dr. Eckman invented the FACS and can determined in how students feel.
