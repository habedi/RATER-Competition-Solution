Dear Principal,

I believe students should be allowed to have cell phones at school. I think we should be allowed to have them in the hall ways and during out free time, but not during a lesson in class. Not allowing students to have phone causes sneaking around and unnecessary punishment. Most teachers think students text each other to cheat, but in reality we text each other to talk. I understand some students text to cheat, but not all. You could prevent cheating via text messages by taking up phones during class and give them back during free time or after class. Cell phones also come in handy when no class room phone is around. If a student or teacher was hurt, a student could call for help. If there was a fire or shooter at the school and no phone or teacher around, students would be helpless with out communications. Having a cell phone in school puts a feeling of safety in our pockets. Students could also contact their parents if they need something for school or an unexpected early release. Texting also helps a class room to be quieter. Instead of yelling across the room to talk to a best friend, students could just text them. Its quiet even though you're still talking. So Principal, I hope you take this into consideration. To conclude my movement I believe cell phones are not as bad as adults believe it to be.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
