Dear Principal,

I understand that you may not like cell-phones being used in our school but the only problem with them is that they are a distraction to the learning process. As long as we do not use them during class time but only during free time such as free periods or lunch then I don't think that they are a problem.

My first reason is that almost everybody does some sort of after school activity whether they are sports or clubs or anything else. These things are constantly getting canceled and rescheduled. Students need to inform there parents if they have practice and what time their parents need to pick them up at. For example I planned on staying after school to watch the school basketball game. On the announcements I was informed that this was cancelled. My mother was coming right from work to pick me up. I had to inform her at lunch or she would have left work early and have been waiting for me. During lunch I informed her with my cell-phone and the problem was resolved but if you do not allow us to use our cell-phones then this could turn into a real issue.

My second reason is that cell-phones are bad because they are a distraction. If we are only using them when we are not learning then how can they be a distraction. At home sometimes I text when i am doing my homework and this really distracts me and I can't get my homework done so I stopped.

During class I totally agree that cell-phones are nothing but a nuisance to teachers so they should be turned off so students can learn. When we are not learning then cell-phones aren't always bad because we are having fun, getting something accomplished even if it is the littlest thing and there is no way they can distract us if we are not doing anything anyway.

People have some pretty stupid stereotypes for why cell-phones bad but most of these aren't even true. For example when someone says "Cell Phones are a waste of time", they are wrong because you might be asking a friend what the homework was or you may be planning a trip to Brazil to learn about the creatures in the rainforest. I am begging you not to completely ban cell-phones because this will cause an uproar of people banging on your door because you banned cell-phones without any hard evidence. If you go out and take a survey of all the students and they say ban cell-phones then I will be okay, but I am positive that what the student body at are school wants is to continue to use cell phones during class time because it is not disrupting the learning process.
