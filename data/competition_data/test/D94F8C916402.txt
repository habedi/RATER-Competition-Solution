Dear, Principal

Changing rules can be good , but changing the eligibility would be terrible.

you may say changing the rule to require a B average will encourage them to get better grades, but it wont it will drive people away from your school.

your school depends on children and children like sports.

More students will drop out of the school then try to get better grades.

i know that sports helps in several different ways.

sports can help by having something to work for student will stay out of fights so they can play in a game. they will also stay physically fit.

staying inside studding all the time is a bad thing. it is okay if you have a test to study for it, but getting exercise is extremely important.

if you are not fit you wont live as long, therefore you cant use your brain.

how do many young athletic teens get into collage? sports!

sports guides people and helps they stay motivated not to do wrong.

i am in a sport i feel like it helps me and to want good grades and to want to stay out of trouble. if majority of your school can't play sports their grades will drop.

its not only sport its all the other activities chess club and any other activity.

this take away their childhood.

some people live for their sport or whatever activity. you don't know what your doing to all of these kids.

changing this rule would ruin your school and many peoples lives.

please think what i have said.

From, student
