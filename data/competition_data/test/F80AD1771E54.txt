I think we should make the grade required should be a C average for sports reasons. In some sports the best players on the team could be the least smartest and not have such good grades. This may draw conflict with either player, coach, or parents of that child. Our school needs a good sports program so that if we're not in the smartest categories we can still be noticed as a good school by our sports program. Some kids that choose to come to this school could be a big sports junky and not be to smart.

I'm not saying that we should let the kids that are failing classes and still get to start in there favorite sport during school. It's better for a school to be known for its smart children and good helping teachers, but getting that extra look at sports could be a big deal. They're several schools around here that have good sports programs, but some schools around our area could have no sports program and have some of the smartest kids in the state attend there. Who knows sports could be taking children's minds off of their school work. That doesn't mean take them out of the one thing they love the most. Yes you should warn them when the have a low grade that they need to bump it up. I'm just saying that if our school has two good looks maybe more parents would like us and want to register their children in our school district.
