Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is a remarkable idea, many teenagers as well as children would benefit from this being put into place. Offering online classes and video conferencing taking place from home would not only have a positive impact on many students but parents as well. This advancement in technology should be installed in schools as soon as remotely possible because of the many responsibilities children already have, the increase in teenagers with part or full time jobs, and the immense amount of preparation for online college classes this would provide.

To begin, in school classes take around eight hours of every child's day, having online classes could potentially cut that number of hours in half. Thus allowing children to preform other responsibilities, such as, helping their parents with childcare of their younger siblings. Already both the parents and students are benefiting from online classes and video conferences made from home. A student has many responsibilities most would say school being the biggest, although that is not always how it is viewed. Past more than present students often had to drop out of school entirely in order to help the family, if this form of technology had existed then many more people would have had a chance to be successful.

Furthermore, there has been an increasing amount of teenagers with part or even full time jobs. All jobs available for full time high school students are night shifts. What this means is that a student would get out of school around approximately three in the afternoon, go straight to work, and get off around eleven or twelve at night. That process would be repeated many times throughout the week, leaving the student exhausted. In multiple cases school systems see a drop in grades from the students that are employed. Although, grades may suffer some students do not have a choice in whether they have a job or not. Not all parents are able to provide fro their children like they should, resulting in teenage employment. With online classes the student would be able to complete school work faster providing extra time to study, and allowing him or her to work earlier shifts in the day.

Lastly, the entire roll of high school is to prepare young adults for college. Many students decide to do general studies online through community colleges. They may find themselves struggling to maintain good grades without sitting inside a classroom. With the preparation they would receive from the distance learning program, they would not have to sweat it. Students would also learn important skills such as time management and an advanced acknowledgment of computers that would benefit them in future college classes.

On the other hand, distance learning could be seen as an easy way out. There would be without a doubt students that would neglect the system. Immature young adults would not even bother to do the work themselves, instead they would use sites such as Kahoot and Quizlet to complete their assignments. Another issue that would diminish at home learning would be the students without access to internet. In every plan there are flaws, but without a doubt the positives outweigh the negatives in this scenario .

In conclusion, distance learning programs should be offered and encouraged in every school nationwide. With these being installed and used properly, young students will flourish in the education department as well as the real world. Online schooling allows for students to take on more responsibilities such as family devotion and jobs. Before students were unaware of what online college courses threw at them, but with this being implemented they will be given a taste before making a decision. This advancement on technology has been on the rise fro many years now, it is well over time to demonstrate its effectiveness.
