Over the summer, very few students have the desire to do any homework, especially not a project. In the scenario where a school mandates a summer project, the summer project should be student-designed. Having student-designed projects would make the assignment easier for students to complete and it would also ensure that the students are gaining knowledge from completing the assignment. Assigning a project that isn't grueling and time consuming, as teacher-designed projects tend to be, would result in more students completing the assignment and learning.

Many students never complete projects during the regular school year, and assigning a summer project would seem like an impossible task. However, if the project appealed to students it would be more likely that they would complete it and this could spark a butterfly effect that leads into the next year for those students. It would cause students who don't complete projects or assignments, to turn into consistent, non-procrastinating students. Learning is often made into a very monotonous and dreadful thing but if schools designed learning for students, intelligence would be more spread out across the school. There wouldn't be the groups of "smart kids", the groups of "dumb kids", or the groups of "average kids" and the school, as a whole, would be more successful.

A very typical and repetitive summer project is "summer reading". Many schools don't assign this as a mandatory project that is expected to be completed by every student, but is often assigned as a prerequisite to enter high level English classes or to join certain clubs. When the school year begins, a lot of very educated and worthy students are denied the ability to attend that high level class because they haven't completed the summer reading project. Now the logic behind this is, "If a student can't read one book over the summer, how can they be expected to read multiple books throughout the entire English course ?". What many people don't take into account, is the fact that regardless of a teenager's intelligence, they will usually neglect all school work until the last minute and end up forgetting. They will either end up not being able to fully put their knowledge to use, or lying about reading in order to enter a class, neither of these outcomes benefit the student.

An argument against these claims would be, "If teacher-designed projects are assigned, it will be easier for teachers to grade the assignment and this could benefit the student even more by giving them a better grade and better feedback.". Teacher-designed projects are capable of this, and students would be able to receive more well-rounded, and understood grades if the assignment was being graded based off of a rubric. With a teacher-assigned project, teachers can compare each student's work to past projects that have been completed by other students and accurately determine how good the project is. These types of projects ensure that all students will learn the same amount by eliminating the option for students to do projects about something they are already very educated about in their personal life.

Student-designed projects are more reliable and consistent than teacher-designed projects. They allow students to fully display their intelligence and academic potential. They also allow students to educate themselves about a topic. This leads to better learning habits in the future; and overall, it can turn a good student into an even better student.Â
