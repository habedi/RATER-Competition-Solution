Dear Principal,

I am writing to you on behalf of all students with a grade C average who would like to play sports. I think a grade C average shows that you can do better but you just choose not to because you "don't see the purpose". If students with a grade C average were given the opportunity to play sports this would be the boost they need to get and keep their grades at a B average or higher . When you play a sport you come to love it, it becomes a part of your life The sport is your life! That student knows that if they FALL BEHIND in school then they will get LEFT BEHIND in sports. I think you will see a huge improvement in the grades of your students.

I also think that sports are a way to get parents involved in their child's or children's school life. when a child plays a sport they want the parents to come to come to their games. When the parent sees their child in action they feel proud. This will motivate the parent to help their child with their school work so that the child can continue to play their sport.

Sports are not only good in school but they help outside of school also. They (they being sports) are a release for troubled children. They are a safe activity after school. They are some children's only chance at college. Sports will change a child's life. I know that you would love to be a part of that change.

In all i just hope that this paper gave you some insight on the minds of your students and helped you make the right choice.

Thank You For Your Time,
