Have you ever been bored by the dull contents of school? Schools are normally the same everyday, which can cause one to feel as if their life is on repeat. It can feel droning and never-ending with each passing day. More often than not, children need something to break up the repetitive cycle of everyday school. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they bring out one's talents, help one to make real friends, and give students something to look forward to.

First off, extracurricular activities can help bring out a student's talents. School is a "one size fits all" kind of approach, and most students don't always fit in the mold. Each kid finds interest in a different thing or skill. For instance, I took a painting class when I was in the 3rd grade. Painting is now something I do, almost daily, for relaxation and fun. Another example is, my friend Generic_Name started playing soccer when she was in kindergarten. Since then, she has become the captain of an amazing team that made it to nationals last year. Soccer is her passion and she has grown into a great player.

Second, extracurricular activities help kids make new friends. They "funnel" students into separate interest groups making it easier to create conversations. Kids are also able to make connections through this shared topic of interest. For instance, I play field hockey and I have to try out to make a team. At my last tryout, a seemingly nice girl approached me and asked how long I had been playing for. She started a simple conversation with a topic that we both love, and made a connection between the two of us. Another example is, my cousin plays softball and was invited to a sleep away camp. At first, she was anxious about not having anyone to talk to. After that weekend away, she came back she told me all about her new friends that she had met through this camp, doing something they all enjoy.

Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to look forward to. School is generally not an event that students look forward to in a positive manner. Extracurricular activities can be looked forward to with a smile due to the fact that it is participated in because of the student's interests. For example, I look forward to field hockey. I love going to practices to see my friends and going to "away" tournaments to play with teams from everywhere. Another instance is, my little sister and cross fit. My sister recently started cross fit and she loves it. Every Wednesday, she goes and sees all of her friends and comes home with the biggest smile. On Tuesday nights she excitedly talks with my mom saying things like, "We have to get there on time tomorrow, I almost missed the warm ups."

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are beneficial to students in many different ways. Students can develop life long talents and passions as well as life long friends that share your interests. These activities can also be looked at like a special event to liven up one's day to day life. Extracurricular activities are interesting and still maintain the ability to brighten up any average school day.
