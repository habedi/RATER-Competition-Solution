Education is a essential part in your life and also an opportunity to have your dream job in the future, is really important assist to school to have education, but there is a many reasons to be absent in school for example: for some people is difficult assist to class cause maybe they missed the scholar bus and they did not have a transportation or they could have a part time job that worn out them to be ready for the next day of school and also the weather can be in extremely bad conditions and it is dangerous be outside so you can stay aware at home.

Nevertheless, however there is also a many options for do not miss the content of the classes of the school cause you can attend classes from home by video conferencing or online, that is a good benefit for you cause you can stay in home and at the same time be able to keep on track your study, but also has a disadvantage cause not everyone has a internet connection at home and that make kinda impossible attend classes from home and also you can get confused with a topic and you have questions and your teacher could not be able in that precise moment to solve your questions then you will have to wait until the teacher could be available again.

There is more disadvantages for example: you cannot enjoyed the activities that school organized or field trips that school planned, you could not spend some time with friends and also with your teachers and you could not contribute with school activities and be in clubs or sports team of the school. Those are activities that students were attend classes online from home maybe could not be able to get done.

Above all the disadvantage of attent classes at home there is the same benefits that go to regular school offer to you but with a different method of learning.

In conclusion, there is many ways to continue school even if you stay at home through a online site, of course there will be disadvantages but you always can see the benefit of that and you have to make more effort than normal to learn new things. I think distance learning is a good choice cause has almost the same benefits that go to school, but instead you staying at home
