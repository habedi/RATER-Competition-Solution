Dear Principal

Please do not change the school policy, many students have a C average. It won't be fair to the students that have a C average. If their isn't enough players that have a B average they won't be able to play the other team.

Not many student will be able to play if they have a C average. Many students will be disappointed if they can't play. Also many of the good players have a C average and if they can't play the team would probably lose. Many parents would be disappointed too if they see that their children is not playing. The parents might come and protest because you won't let their children play if they don't have a B average. Their probably won't be anything good on the school paper if most of the students can't play. Most student love to play sports after school because it gives them time to not think about school. This is why you shouldn't change the school policy.
