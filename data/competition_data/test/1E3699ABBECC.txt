Do you ever wonder if you want to play a sport or any extracurricular activity well this is your chance to try out anything you want.

I agree with the principle because it could make you want to do it for the rest of your life if you really like what you chose.

First, you have to try you cant just say you want to do it then you dont show up for anything or you cant just go there and do nothing you actually have to try.

secound, you have to want to do it you cant just sipaly chose something caue your teacher says you have to it can even be something you have done befor.

lastly, you cant say dont like something until you try i say that all the time when my parents want me to try something new but then i try and go back and relize i should not have said i dont like cause u never know unless you try it.

in counclusion, i think this gives you a big chance to do something new and who knows maybe it can change your life but if u dont like it dont keep doing it move on to something new.

you have to try you cant just give up. If you dont like it try something new. always do something for more than one day cause if you do it for only one day you will never know if you like until you try it for more than one day. lasty, you wont ever know until you try.

you have to want to do it not just cause you have to. If it seems cool to you try it you never know you might like it. Read details about it to learn more about maybe that will make you want to do it more. dont dought what you think always go with what your mind says.

you cant say you dont like it until you try it . I have learnd to never say you dont like it until you try it but if you do say that you can always change your mind about what you think.

counclusion, dont ever disagree with what your mind says cause sometimes your mind is right.

incounclusion, this is a chance for you to change who you are and what you do in life it could change your grades to make them better but only if you try.
