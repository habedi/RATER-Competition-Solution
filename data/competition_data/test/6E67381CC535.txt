Dear Principle,

I think you should not make the average grade from a C to a B to participate in sports.

I think you should not do that because many students maybe trying their hardest ever but is still struggling to get a higher grade in school. Also if you make the average to a B it may make some of the students work harder, but you would maybe lose almost all your players on that sports team, since most of them have C' s in their grades. And also some of the students would not get a scholarship on that sport they are playing because you raised the average to a B. Also some of the best players on teams sometimes has the lowest grades out of all the players on that sport they are playing. In my opinion I think it would make a lot more students happier if raised it to a low B. Or even maybe a high C. Maybe u should maybe leave it alone.
