Yes I do think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students prefer to be home school instead of attending class because that might be the best way for them to learn. Some students may like having a video conference or online class about their school work. For example i know this one student that is home school and she said that she loved it because it's super easy for her to catch up on all of her work and her missing assignments she even have a teacher that comes to her house to help her and guide her. I know that some online classes can be kinda hard and frustrating but real easy .

if you take your time and read through it but you also have to make sure that you stay on track with your modules are you will be behind on all of your work. The good thing about having online classes is that it is self pace and you can submit your work and assignment when you are ready. Honestly i think that all schools should offer distance learning classes as a option because it will help a lot of students out with their grades and everything. For example i take a online chemistry class and it is very hard and frustrating for me i'm very slow on self pace but i always try to get my work done as quick as i can chemistry is not a easy subject but i get through it moral of the story is that online classes is really helpful for students that have self pace.

I know that some students love having online classes definitey if you are a upper class men it's helps a lot with having less classes and school work some studnets be behind on there work assigments with self pace i'm a slow worker i take my time doing my work even though i be getting confused on some stuff i be behind on a lot of work but i still get it done i might turn it in a couple of days later but it will still be complete even though i will get some points taken off.

And it is also better because you don't get mark tardy or absent unlike being in school i really kinda wish that i was home school it will be way easier for me to do all of my classes online instead of in school struggling he can get help.
