Have you bever seen land that looks like a face?

There's a Face on Mars ,however; some people think it was created by aliens.

Some people do not think that like me.

It is located in Cydonia and the space craft arrived on September 1997.

Scientist discovered by looking for possible landing sites.

The Face is just a natural landform and it wasn't created by aliens.

Only some scientist thought is was from an alien but I know it's not.

The text states, "Although few scientist beleived the Face was an alien artifact."

The few scientist thought that it was made by aliens therefore, they didn't have any evidence.

Nevertheless, NASA unveiled the image for all to see and the caption was noted a "huge rock formation."

So at the beginning they figured it was a rock but they didn't say anything about it being created by aliens.

Evidence is a very important thing for scientist.

Many people learned what the "Face" was when they revealed it to the public.

The author reveals, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."

They said it was a natural landform because they zoomed up on it and could see no aliens..

For 25 years the face has been in magazines and it has even been in hollywood movies.

All of them said it was a natural landform.

Many people were excited about the Face.

If aliens created it they would have left evidence, like a shrine, monument, or you could see them in pictures.

After publishing it the author says, " There was no alien monument after all."

That proves that it was not created by aliens, but many people disagreed.

Everyone were not satisfied because they thought aliens created it.

Although, some skeptics said alien markings were hidden by a haze.

But the scientist did not think that, so they went out again and looked for the face to take more pictures.

The Face was located in Cydonia it is a hard place to locate.

The picture from 2001 was more clear than the one from 1975.

The pictures didn't show any monument of aliens and they could not tell they were even there.

Lots of evidence proves aliens did not create the Face.

What the face is described is a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

The article states, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."

That states it looks like a landform from Earth.

This proves that no matter what people think it was not created by aliens.

The Face is just a natural landform and it wasn't created by aliens.
