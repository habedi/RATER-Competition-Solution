Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes online or video conferences. Do I think students would benefit this more? Yes I do believe that this can be something that these Young Kids growing on becoming what they wanna be as adults. Do I think they would possibly enjoy this more for maybe personal reasons or making more time for other things that might be important to you as well.

Some kids that want to start working early to start saving up getting your own things, not having to worry about other people trying to get you stuff. But maybe helping family with money and things at home that they probably would want you to do for them. also putting school in mind because you might need to buy certain things for school that you might really need to get for yourself to help your learning online. Doing things on your very own for yourself and for family. caring for what truly matters.

Another reason on doing this is maybe doing things with family more, out of school activities that you might be doing Like sports. If you ever have a trip to some where with a family member or a friend. maybe take your materials and computer and do it whenever. Wherever you go and got time to get back to it when you're ready.

If not then maybe just do all the work when your back on doing whatever just dont forget about getting work done for school maybe email them too letting them know your having a trip or whatever is happening at that moment of time. You might play a sport and have a team that you love playing with outside of school and you make more time on playing with them. Wouldnt mind learning and working during the night maybe?, During the day. whenever is easiest and best for you.

Realized that there is different types of kids and people in the world where they would like to work alone and be where they prefer is better for them to work. Some kids say that being in crowds make them feel uncomfortable in some sorta way, it doesnt make them feel like they wanna be there for personal reasons that they possibly gone through in life. So thats why kids sometimes leave and go some where else that the staff wouldnt like during lunch or wherever during the day. Then the kids get in trouble for not wanting to be some where that they dont wanna be at.

So I think kids that feel this way during school in some certain classes or the whole day of school. Maybe you can have the opportunity to work your classes online instead of in school. Doing things that is possibly best for you on improving yourself in life and learning to getting your education could be a good choice for you if you dont like dealing with certain things that you agree and understand for people that want to do this too.Â
