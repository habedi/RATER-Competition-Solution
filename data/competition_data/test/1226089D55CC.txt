A principle theorizing about a mandatory extracurricular activity is not a new one, but thousands and thousands of like minded people have thought it a good Idea. Should principles require out of school activities? Would this help students or simply serve as a means to increase their already demanding workload? I know that this would help with a variety of issues facing students today. Some of the benefits of and extracurricular activities are the ability of less popular or shy students to make more friends through a shared interest, the possibility of a sparked interest that would have otherwise gone unnoticed, and the ability for students to make real change to benefit themselves and their peers.

Many students today have trouble making friends, and with the rise of cliques in schools it only gets progressively more difficult as the years go on. An extracurricular could make it far easier for new friendships to develop when they otherwise would not. A shared interest is a powerful tool to make connections with people and be the catalyst for a great friendship, and people with similar interests flocking to the same clubs or activities many new friendships are bound to be formed.

If students should join a club, an interest that would have gone undiscovered would rise to the surface potentially becoming a life long hobby or even career. Without these clubs to spark their interest who knows if they will discover their true passion in life. These activities would not only be a way to get someone excited about a topic but could actually be a way to use your talents at something you care about.

Students today feel as if their voice is not heard, they feel as if their parents and teachers don't care what they think about anything. That is a real issue, and if we ever wish to make the next generation the best, we must let their voices be heard and let them express their opinions. Clubs like a student council could be just the way to do that, getting something done and having tangible evidence that you have been heard and someone cared about it, like getting more basketballs in the gym or something similar. letting students make the lives of themselves as wellÂ as their peers would be a powerful way to give students confidence.

So with the ability to form new friendships, the chance to foster a new interest, and the possibility to make real change, yes I support the idea to require an extracurricular activity for students. Someone might be shy or not have many friends, but with these clubs, they could start new friendships and live a better life at school and at home, they could have an interest but not be able to express it, but the clubs could give them a chance to use their talents, and finally they might not feel heard, but the activities will help them feel like their voice matters. So the question should Principles mandate extracurricular activities is a simple one to answer, yes.
