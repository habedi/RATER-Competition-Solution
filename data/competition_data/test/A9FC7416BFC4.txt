During the summer, students want to play video games, hang out in the mall with their friends, relax at the pool, or just sit at home in their room and just be on their phones. The one thing students dislike is that schools expecting them to finish up a summer reading project or a math project. They do not like it at all. But, if the students play a part in planning some of those projects and it becomes student-designed, it may persuade the students to actually care about it and possibly build up a good study habit throughout the summer as well.

Student-designed summer projects should take over teacher-designed summer projects due to the fact that student would be interested in perfecting their skills in areas such as reading and writing, which in some cases, those are some of the areas where students struggle at coming back to school. In addition, the students may not feel obligated to do it. They may feel like they have to do this because the school made them do it over the summer to stay focus. If the project was student-designed, the student would feel like the teacher or school is hearing them out. Therefore, the student will do it because they had a piece of input in the project and the teacher/school would not have to worry about most of them not caring about the summer project.

The goal of a school is to ensure that the students are getting the education they need and to help get the students involved more in learning and by having a summer project that is student-designed it would put them one step closer to that goal. For example, if the students were able to help design the project for the summer, they technically still be helping to achieve the schools goal which is to get them ready over the summer.

In conclusion, student-designed projects should replace teachr designed projects because in the student-designed projects would help the students get invovled more during the summer and they would care about it more because they were apart of the process rather than teacher-designed projects which you have to do what the teacher wants you to do.
