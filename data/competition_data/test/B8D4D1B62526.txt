Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. However; the question is students would benefit from being able to attend class from home? It is seems to me that attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes at school; In addition, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers; Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. With out a doubt, school provides knowledge, values, and skills that will benefit students in their academic life, as well as, their social life.

In the first place, attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes that school offers. For example, my High School provides different types of optional classes, as Electricity, Cosmetology, Floral Design, and others, which is enthusiastic for some students. Last semester my friend Generic_Name took Floral Design Class. Generic_Name went to numerous fascinating fill trips of her Floral Design Class. Additionally, she was one of the organizer of the decoration of the Graduation Night

Generic_Name was so dedicated to her Floral Design Class that she was always talking about becoming a florist in a future.

Certainly, unlike the students that take classes from home do not have the opportunity to create talents at school that will make beneficial for their academic life.

Pursuing this further, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers. For instance, teachers, administrators, and councilors can provide support at students in their homework, classes, or even their personal lives. Ms. Generic_Name my ESL teacher she is one of the great examples of it. I am not trying to brag, but she demonstrates day by day the importance of being communicate. Moreover, every day in class as we transmit our ideas we learn more about the topic in which we are discussing and also we gain experience of her voyage to became a teacher. In fact, she always mention that strives with determination for our goals take us to denied the fears to reach the victory. Nevertheless, school plays an important role in students life.

Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. For example, students that take classes at home are procrastinators because they do not have rules, or people that can help them in their personal development, which is a important for all students. In fact, we humans are not born with all our qualities or talents. At school we can built manners, values, and skills that will contribute in our future jobs, or social life. In order to success in life we have to come to school not to stay at home.

By all counts and with proven results; there is no doubt that attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes at school; In addition, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers; Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. Let's take a stand together and let the parents and schools board knows that take classes at home are not beneficial for students.
