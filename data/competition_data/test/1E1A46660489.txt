Hello citizens my name is Luke Bomberger and my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat with him and I just couldnt say no! In 1945 World War ll was done and many countries were shredded. So Don and I helped them out by traveling by sea and were called ''Seagoing Cowboys''. I suggest u people too come out and help us out with the people who lost all of there resourses from World War ll. So if everyone come out to help us with these people we cn change there lives and our lives by helping them. Also I wouldnt be doing this with out Don he got me into all this and i just couldnt say no, and we have been doing this for a couple of months and we love it!

We can all help out by being a Seagoing Cowboy and when we are done with these events we have alot of extra time so we can visit places around where evever we are! For an example I toured an excavated castle in Crete and i view at the panama Canal on my way to China! So not all of what we do is boring we do alot of worthy things and fun things.

So come on down and all of you can be Seagoing Cowboy and help us with the people from World War ll who badly need help. Again my name is Luke Bomberger and my partners name Is Don so come on down and help us with this big problem.
