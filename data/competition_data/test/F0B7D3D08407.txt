Distance learning is a unique way for students to learn and incorporate their school life, in the compfort of their home. While distance learning may seem like the best possible way to go, you still need to keep in mind the pros and cons of a situation like this. Most online classes do offer a more flexible schedual, but at what cost?

The current school that I am attending offers some online courses that some of my fellow classmates have participated in. I asked their opinions on online classes and they mostly shone a negative light onto this subject. One of the negative aspects of an online course, is that you don't get to speak face to face with a teacher. Some studies that I have read have shown that face to face communication is more effective than online chatting. When a conversation is held face to face, you can better understand the tone and emotions that a person is trying to convey.

To add on too my last paragraph, it also helps when you can interact with your other peers. When you have someone else around your age who understands what is being thought, they can better help explain the subject to you if you didn't understand the teacher. Also, it helps when you have classmates to make you laugh and take your mind of a hard moment. If you take an online class, you are typically by yourself and have nobody to associate with.

Another disadvantage of online classes are the temptations it provides. If you are in the compfort of your own home surrounded by things you like, you might be tempted to pick up your phone to check a text or, go outside to play with your new puppy. This may cause you struggle in the online class, because the distractions are affecting your ability to comprehend what is being thought. Some people will still choose to have an online course because it better suites their learning style.

At the end of the day, I still beileive that a traditonal classroom experience is the best way to go. You still get your education while also gettting the oppurtunity to have a hands on and social learning experience.
