Phones & Driving

There is a growing discussion debating whether people should be able to use their phone while driving or not be able to. Considering there's an average increase in car accidents since phones added all the features to text,games or watch movies but the phone is also a good access for people to navigate to their destination by wia gps. To continue with those topics people shouldnt be able to use their Device whether it's in hands free mode or not. It's too dangerous and a big risk.

Although, Having a phone can result in car accidents it most definitely helps when it comes to the navigation factor of trying to get to your destination. Whether it's the gps notify the driver there is another car accident ahead or heavy traffic. The end result which convinces most of the argument to side with the phone is that it helps the driver get to their destination faster.

Even Though, phones make it such a difficult topic to debate whether people should even be allowed to have phones on while driving but again not only do they help with getting to your destination quicker but it also can make people business better a lot of people answer the phone in the car and most of all those car have hand free mode which technically make the phone safer. ALthough phones get you yo your destination quicker it also has gotten so bad that the law made it illegal as stated " Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdiction has made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal".

Also , On the other hand it was found cars with the hands free mode are as dangerous if your device is on hand on mode which gets this argument rolling the article found states; " the obvious implication is that hands-free phone calls may be almost as dangerous as a hand-held call. This danger is less obvious to the public, especially as a ban on hand-held calls can be seen to support the "safer" hands-free alternative".(David Crundall)

To conclude, Driving with hand free mode can be equivalent to having hand held while driving but considering the quote/article from David crundall it proves people shouldn't be able to use their Device whether it's in hands free mode or not. It's too dangerous and a big risk.
