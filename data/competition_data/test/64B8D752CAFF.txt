The residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers,in this experimental new district the streets are completely car-free. People feel tense when they drive so they feel better this way, without cars. They are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Some of the advantages of this is that the most percent of accidents in the world are accidents of cars, with this is going to be less accidents. They are being adopted around the world in attemps to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less space for parking. With the car reduce we are protecting our environment. Others advantages are about health the cars are afecting the air, with cars out of street we are going to have a clean environment.

With this we are helping to cleanÂ  the air of global city. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars,hybrids,and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday.

In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to working during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this city eerily devoid of traffic jams. This is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution .Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

In United States studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit;the place where Wilson Pickett inmortalized 'Mustang Slly'.But American's love affair with its vehicles seemss to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth,the number of miles in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives,an investment researchcompany. As April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling. If the pattern persists- and many sociologist believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

A sociology professor cites various factors, the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps facilited more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting work.

With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. The childrens to 19 and 21 have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends. This say that people enjoy more the public buses or walk or ride in a bike because they go with friends thay talk they spend they time better than a car, that's other advantage. A study last year found that young people who drive have decrease 23 percent between 2001and 2009. Commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be appreved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. There are so many advantages about living without a car we just have to help the world be a better place for everybody.
