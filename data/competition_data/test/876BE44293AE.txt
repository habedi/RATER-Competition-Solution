Who wants to do a new project made by somebody else thats confusing during your only break? Students lose their free time trying to figure out what to do and how to complete the work the teachers give to them, and we can't ask for help and get it like we would in school so most students struggle on trying to complete it the way the teachers want it done. I believe the students should come up with the project design because we can complete it faster, the work would be better to the teachers to look at cause it'll be different ideas from each student.

Since they can complete the work their way it can give them more time to themselves, family, and friends instead of trying to think on how to finish the work. They can struggle on the same part since they out with family and constantly doing something and not giving them time to complete it. Since teachers usually be so strict on how to get the work done then it can cause stress on the students and could mess up their whole break trying to finish it or just make them not even want to do any of it. But the better the student can make the project for themselves the more work they can get done faster than a whole different design.

Another thing is on how it can be better work cause of the different ideas. Plenty of families go on vacation to different places with their kids or go to different places doing fun things, and since that could take up most of the time they can just do it based on what they have done that break. Some teachers want to hear about what their students did during that summer, and the different ideas from the students can make the teacher have something entertaining to read or see other than looking at the same thing over and over at the beginning of the year. The way the students think too can change how good the project turn out to be and can be something fun for the students to work on too and can change how their school year begin.

If they schools allow students to design their own projects it can really turn out better on everybody and give them more time to enjoy their break and even though we could come up with it we can still learn new things while working on it, planning on how to work on it, or after completing it. But this is why I think we should have student designed projects.
