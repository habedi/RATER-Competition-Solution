Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth due to it being the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and also craters.

If we were to explore Venus and learn more about it we could use it as a backup plan or Earth incase something were to happen to the current one, not to mention it can be crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. But traveling to Venus can be dangerous. Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus for more than 3 decades,97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, the clouds highly contain sulfuric acid, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater, and it can be really hot, hotter than mercury even. But scientist in NASA are finding ways and building new technologies to study about Venus. For example bump-like vehicles hovering 30 or so miles above the landscape to avoid any unfriendly conditions by staying in the air. It would still be hot and the air pressure would be close to sea level but it would be survivable for humans.

Although it would provide a limited amount of sight, you would still have to chance to not only see but to explore safely and learn more about Venus. Traveling to study Venus will not only answer unanswered questions, but can come in our favors in the future. Yes, it will be dangerous but it will teach survival and give us answers.
