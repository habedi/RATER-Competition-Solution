Should students be required to join an extracurricular activity?

All students must participate in at least one activity because it helps them find a new hobby and will benefit their health and academics.

First of all, participating in new activity will help students find a new hobby.

Students have a opportunity to discover something that they never knew they would have enjoyed.

For example, when they attend an club such as yearbook, cooking club, or soccer, they may end up liking that activity that could lead to a future career, such as being a writer, chef, athlete, etc.

Second of all, they will find themselves constantly busy.

Most teens are always complaining about how bored they are, but once you find a hobby, you will be motivated to practice it rather than lying around on their bed or going on their phones.
