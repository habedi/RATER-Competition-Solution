Have you ever hurd are know about are solar system and whats all in it ? Are solar system is made up of alot of things such ass oher planets ,stars ,l arg rocks,and different galexys . Out of all the plantes Earth is the 3rd planet away from the sun .

Venus has its ups and downs and what I mean about this is that venus has good reasons why people shold go study it . Some bad reasons is that Are planets traval at different speeds .

And on previous mission no spacecraft have ever survived on the planet for more than a few hours . Something else that is very bad for you is that its atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and on the surface of the planet temperature reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit . Some good things about Venus is that it is cloest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and sometimes close in distance .

just like how earth is now Venus was once coverd largely with oceans and could have supported life forms .

Also Venus had a surace that is rocky sediment with valleys mountains and craters .

In conclusion Venus has its ups and downs but I do believe that it is worth studing despite the dangers that come with it . Also i do believe that we should send spacesrafts up there what are mre durable then the other ones that was sent there a long time ago because of the new tecnology that we have . I think that its possable that we could come up with more samples of different items .
