As technology increases, the idea of driverless cars is startin to become a reality." Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive thenselves by 2020." As the passage states that diverless cars are on the way and are already in progress. Although the thought of not having to have your liscens sounds great, I am against the developement of these cars. The developement of diverless cars would cause conflict among manufacturers and the people. Also there could be mechanical problems that come along with the developement of driverless cars causing safety issues. Lastly, most people enjoy having control over their own car which also allows for responsability.

Safety is a the number on issue with driverless cars. If there was a mechanical issue while people were on the road, it could cause injuries. Also, if the car was not functioning right and you are stuck out in the middle of the road, who would be there to fix it? Just like any other mechanical object, it is a possibility that thing will go wrong.

" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who it at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?" In agreement with the quote from the passage I also question who is at fault. These issues will cause unessesary conflict between the manufacturers and the people. Being able to manually drive cars would additionally enable us to avoid these issues and know who is resposible.

Having control over your own car gives you more comfortability knowing who is behind the wheel and how the vehicle operates. Also being able to drive yourself will teach you responsability that is necessary part of growing up. " even if trafic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in case of an accident." The developement of driverless cars would also lead to new regulations of the law and the people having to know it.

Although driverless cars are long way away, its a big transition from diriving a car "manually" to literally automatic. I am against the developement of these cars because it will cause conflict withe the manufactures and the peolple. Also there could be mechanical problems that could cause safty issues. Lastly, most people enjoy having control over their own car which also allows for the learning of responsability.
