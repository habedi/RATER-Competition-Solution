Dear Principal,

In my opinion I think that cell phones would be ok to have in or at lunch and other free time that students are given. Schools are linnet and let us use our cell phones as long as its not in a class, but most of us feel as if we are breaking the rules. I think that in order for students to not feel like they have to be sneaky about cell phones in school, is to allow students to use their cell phones during the free time that students are given.

Most all students in junior high and high school have cell phones and bring them to school. I do not see the problem with having cell phones at school, but I believe the reason teachers have become so strict with the policy is because students are misusing the freedom that teachers have given. Also I think that students that enjoy to break the rules use their cell phones against authority because they know that it will upset the teachers that fallow the rules the most.

As students I think that we should have the right to use cell phones as long as we do not abuse the privilege of being able to use our cell phones in school, instead of not being able to use them at all. In most cases there are few students who abuse their cell phones. They abuse it by cyber bullying and other things that are not appropriate at any age epically our age alone. In many cases children our age are given cell phones by their parents for a reason, and that reason is not so that the child can text but so that the parents can reach them at any given time of the day and so in case of an emergency the parent or child can reach one another.

Many kids my age are not using cells phones for the right reason and its causing a great issue in the United States. Not only is texting in school becoming a problem but texting and driving is also becoming an issue as well. Most all students bring their cell phones to school weather its so that at the end of the day they can reach their parents or because they use it during school hours to text others that are in school as well. I and many other students keep their cell phones turned off during school so that they do not get on trouble and leave it in their lockers as well. In conclusion, students should be able to use their cell phones if they do not abuse it.
