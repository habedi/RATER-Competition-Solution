This sounds like a great idea because teachers wouldn't have to worry about getting around to everyone in the classroom, re-teaching the same lesson, trying to figure out what activities/ lesson can help the kids understand more but this could aslo be a big distraction.

I think that the use of this technology to read students expressions is valueable because whatever lesson it is being taught if the student is bored or confused it will modify the lesson. I think this is very useful because as a student i know that when a lesson is boring or not interesting its hard for me to pay attention or get focused. So the fact that it could tell that im not really into it or getting it and it'll change itself to something more "my style" is great. I know that teachers can't be everywhere at once to help or make you understand so when you're at you desk with your hand up waiting on the teacher to get to you probably frustrated by the now the computer will sense it and help you out before your teacher has to see you. This also helps by saving time in the class rooms because somethings not every student will get right away and instead of the teacher re-teaching it over and over the computer will see that your not getting it and change the lesson to something a little more complex, that you get and understand.

Now as much as i am with this idea, a downfall could be students getting too carried away with it. Even though we are in high school kids can still be a little immitaure, this could be a distraction to the kids. They'll try to play with the sytem by making the wrong facial expression on purpose to see if the computer could guess how they're feeling. This could take away from valueable class time.
