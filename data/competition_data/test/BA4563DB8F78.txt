When you were in middle school or high school did you take a sport did your friends take a sport, because if they didn't why are they making kids take them now like if you don't want to take a sport why are they making you. See i'm going to list three reason for you why kids should not have to do a sport if they don't want to.

Reason one is what if they are not capable of taking a sport if they have a broken leg or something do they take the sport after the leg has heeled or maybe some kids disagree about taking a sport what will the principal do will he give you detention or something worse you never know.

Reason two what if you are a new kid at the school and you don't know that rule and the day comes and you don't have a physical do you not have to d it or will you get in trouble. That is what i'm trying to say it is a stuiped way of getting a kid in trouble for no reason.

Finally and last reason is abut the parents what if they don't agree about there kid doing a sport and what if the kid is already in a sport out of school do they have to quit the sport out of school or what. Plus what if they aren't good at the sport and they drop the team what do you think the kids will do o that kids team will they bully him or what so those are my three reason why schools should not require a sport to succeed . But just to rap it up i think schools should not have to do a sport
