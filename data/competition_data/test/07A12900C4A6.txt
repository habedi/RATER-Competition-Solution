Facial Action Coding Systems can be a really good addition to the classroom. This technology can help teachers and staff see what a student is going through and if they need help. This could also help students show a teacher or staff memeber if they need help but don't know how to ask.

Facial Action Coding Systems is a program that lets a computer read human emotion and can show statistics of how you are feeling this is support by the quote, "She's eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and two percent angry. No, that's not your science teacher,grading your latest lab assignment. Its the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotion." The software can help teachers actually help students with mental health instead of writing them a slip and just saying you are fine. Also teachers can tell you how to coop with certain stresses bust by scaning you with a computer program. This can also help teachers find the student that caused trouble if they are not cooperating, because the program can tell if the subject is lying or not. This claim is supported by the following quote. " To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clies are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" polictician or celebrity isn't being truthful." The program can also help schools by seeing if a student is under a lot of pressure and needs help right away.

The overall claim is that I believe that Facial Action Coding System program can really improve mental stability with students and solve disputes between them. The system can really help teachers find out what students need help if they are afraid to reach out. The Facial Action Coding System program could be a really good addition to classrooms.
