I think how America has been using the electoral college all wrong. How would people without cars get around without the electorla college? Many people rely on the electoral college to get to and from work, some people use it to get their kids from school, and homeless people gotta sleep somewhere. The electoral college is something that all of us have relied on the electoral college at least once. I think if the big J in the sky were still here he'd use the electoral college too. That's probably where he'd preform all his miracles and such. I think Jesus would ride and preform his miracles here because what better place is there to preform miracles? A place where mostly poor people go to get to and fro? Sounds like where the messiah would spend his time.

I also think the electoral college is a corrupt system that merely provides the illusion to Americans that we have some actual power in our government, and it shows the real underbelly of the capitalist pig system that is America.
