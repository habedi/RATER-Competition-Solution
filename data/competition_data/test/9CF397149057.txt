HI my name is Luke Bomberger and in have sailed over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times. Thats alot of times now is that alot of times to sail over the atlantic ocean or is it just me. I was helping people affected by world war 2. They were really hurt by it. Every body was crying over the dead bodys of their lost loved ones.

We tryed to help but they refused for us to help them. They said they wanted to be left alone. I do not under stand why they are so sad. Yes their freinds and family is injured and in serious condition or deceased. But i would want someone to aid me if one of my family members was in critical condition. If i was like that i would want some help to. Because we all have heavy duty first aid kits for the injured.

So we helped the ones who wanted aided. And took the ones who needed serious medical help. Others came to we all went back. And then we came back and i met George. he wanted to come back with me. at first i said no stay at yor home. as soon as we were leaving i felt really bad for george so i came back for him. He came back and he lived at my house for a while and then we built him a house so we could be neighbors. we had pool partys and had so much fun and we lived happyly ever after.
