Dear Dr. PROPER_NAME

it has my attention that are school should have online classes and it could benefit us and everyone that dose't go to school any more. If there is a bad storm maybe they drop out and they don't have time any more should have online class for the extra help and it could be a step to a better future.

My reason are the long snow days and other weather problem online class it could give us the chance to take are time and not be rush by other people on online class.It could help student that don't have time for school any more because of work or they got a problem being at school. Maybe a student has to go out of town be of a family emergency but they don't want to get left be hind of the other people in class. They can do online work while they are way they could also ask there teachers for help online and do a video conference and it would be good because the student is getting a one on one lesson and can befit them.

Some people need this if there miss a class credit and they need before graduation it can help them. If they have a full schedule on the school day they can take it online so they can catch up and make it on time for graduation. a lot of people might what to finish school but they don't have the time any more online classes could help balance there schedule. many people want to take a class for the hack of it for a extra credit for maybe an advance diploma or if they just want to get out school faster and graduate. A lot of people would have a lot of time or not a lot of time because of work online class would be helpful for a lot of people.

Online class is the step to good education it could help people get jobs or save money for schools so teachers could have the extra cash for teaching students. Maybe there could be a person that can further are technology and help other people in schools. Online class could get people out of minimum wage and start earning more money. It could also make it a lot easier for people that are home school the information can just be proved online.Online class is a step to a better future and education for people.

Online class should be for are school and others so we can get that extra help. For people that don't have time to go or if school is in a bad snow storm so that way its a step to a better future.
