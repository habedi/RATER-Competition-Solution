In the month of May, 2001 something strange and quite funny happened on the red planet, Mars. As NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the red planet, they snapped a picture of something that had the "likeness of a human face." Some people think the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens, but research has been showing, the face is only a natural landform.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time to see if they could get another shot of the "Face". Sure enough one man snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photos from the Vikings. When the image appeared on a JPL website many were shocked to find it was only a natural landform, there was no alien monument after all.

After all the searching for more information on the "Face on Mars" scientists yet again in April of the year of 2001 drew close enough for another look! Michael Malin and his team captured an amazing, unbelievable photo using a camera with maximum resolution. When examining the photo, they found that the picture actually shows it is "the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."

In conclusion, the "Face on Mars" is only a natural landform and most certainly did not come from aliens. Thanks to the new and improved technology today, scientists were able to find out that the "Face" was only a landform which is even common on Earth.
