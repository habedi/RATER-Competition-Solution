Oh the pleasure of public schools, don't we all just love it so much. We are so lucky to be in a generation where technology is evolving faster than lightning, and online courses are an option. Online courses gives kids the opportunity to take responsibility into their own hands, and learn from home. This allows kids to be able to do work when they are sick, or on snow days when they don't have to come into school. Don't think its that easy though, some kids benefit from having a one on one with a teacher, and some kids just need that social motivation to do their work. If you benefit from having one on ones with teachers, and subjects visually projected to you, then going into school is for you.

If you are a visual creature, and benefit from being in class, than online courses are not for you. Some kids need to be able to sit down and hear the words actually come out of someones mouth. My older brother Generic_Name, one of the smartest kids you will ever meet, but he needs that social motivation to succeed. He home schooled throughout elementary school and middle school, but it just didn't work out from him. He would learn from books and videos, and it was just hard for him to comprehend the subjects. He greatly benefited from being able to be physically be present in class, and to have someone actually teaching. He loved that he was able to hear the words come out of someones mouth, rather then reading them from a book. This shows that even if you have the opportunity to do online courses, it might not be whats best for you.

Teachers having the ability to be able to talk with you one on one won't just benefit you in your education, it can also have a great impact in your everyday life. There was this one kid named Generic_Name, he went to school everyday and didn't really do anything, he just went to school because he had to. In his personal life he was really struggling with addiction, and he just couldn't find the correct motivation to stop, or even start trying in school. One of his teachers finally reached out and asked him whats going on. Generic_Name decided to just talk with him, and let him know what's going on. His teacher was surprised, but he wanted to help this kid get his life back together. He told Generic_Name that he was strong enough to get through this, and if he just tried, things would get better. So Generic_Name did, he came in everyday, checked in with his teachers, and told them how his day was going. His teachers would just say positive comments that would make him feel good about himself as a person, and it made him think he had a chance to become better. Generic_Name started trying and paying attention, and with the help of he teachers he was passing the class, and he actually started to like school. This shows that this kid really benefited from coming into class, he even told this teacher that he wouldnt have graduated if it werent for him.

Kids are weird, and that's just a fact. Some kids like to isolate themselves from other people, and really like to focus on the task at hand. It can actually be distracting to be sitting in a class full of students, and to be forced to sit down for hours. Or have your friends constantly distracting you from your work, that's why some people like to take online courses. People like the fact that they have the ability to do work at home, and not be distracted be others. The opportunity for them to choose when they can do their work, and learn, is awesome to them. It takes great responsibility to create a schedule were you will go and sit down and get your stuff done, without any motivation from another person. It creates good life skills, creating a schedule for yourself and following it from a young age. The ability to choose is yours. You need to find out if you need that social motivation or if you can handle doing your work by yourself. If you know that you need a teacher to help you, and explain things in person, then you know going to class is for you. If you don't need that social motivation, and you like doing your work at your home desk or bed, than great, you found out what works for you. It's all preference, but the ability to be able to choose in this day and age is huge. You have the ability so succeed, weather your at school or not, it's up to you to become the best you can be!
