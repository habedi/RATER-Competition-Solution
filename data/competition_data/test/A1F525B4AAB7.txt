Although it may seem logical to have students do a teacher-designed project over the summer, it happens to cause students more harm than good. Students should be in control of their own projects over the summer. If the summer projects are created by students, then the thought process of them will promote creativity in a student. Another positive impact of having students create their own summer projects is that is raises the levels of responsibility within themselves. They would also be prepared for life after school if their summer projects were student-designed. Students would benefit more positively to designing their own summer projects as it would increase their creativity, aid them into being more responsible, as well as prepare them for adulthood.

Students should be in charge of their own summer project as it'll help them grow creatively. Since the projects are student-designed, then students would have to think outside of the box to create a project that will stand out among their fellow peers. If students were in charge of their own summer project, they would be motivated to learn new ways to apply their new knowledge to the world. Also, it gives the student the chance to explore areas of knowledge outside of the standard curriculum they are given, further more enhancing their creativity. For example, a student could learn editing skills and video design if they decided that their summer project was to create a video about the history of Shakespeare. Since the student was able to make their own rules to their project, the outcome of the project is more likely to benefit them creatively than if the project was to be teacher-designed. Not only do student-designed projects push the students to become more creative, but it also pushes another important factor onto them.

A student would become more responsible is they were to have student-designed summer projects. Due to the project being in the hands of the student, their grade would also be in their hands. This means that if the student failed to complete their project over the summer, their grade would suffer with them. Furthermore, students would have to schedule when they plan to complete their summer project, and how much time they will need to gather the materials and produce it. If they are unable to submit their project online, the student would need to become more organizational in order not to lose their project. An example would be a student receiving a poor grade on a project they underestimated the amount of time needed to complete it and failed to turn in on time, causing the student to be at fault due to a lack in responsibility. As it increases responsibility in a student, it aids them for handling the near future of adulthood.

Being in control of their own project would prepare students for life after school. A student might gain a sense of individuality from their peers since they had to create their own design for a project. Along side a sense of individuality will be the realization of how life really operates, as there are no guides to tell a person what to do in the long run. Being in charge of their own summer project will also prepare them for a work place environment, as the students realize that they need to find different ways to complete a given task if they were not given a way in the first place. In the future, when the student is employed, they will be able to sufficiently complete any work their boss gives them if the boss did not directly inform the student how. Allowing students to design their own summer project will help aid them in adulthood.

It would only be beneficial if summer projects were created by students and not teachers. The students creativity will increase as they are pushed to design a project that stands out among others. Also, they are more likely to have higher levels of responsibility as they are the ones who are in charge of their own grade. Lastly, students would be prepared for adulthood as they are given a better understanding of how life will work. Student-designed projects would aid students further in life than if they were given teacher-designed ones. After completing school, life no longer has a teacher as to instruct a person as to what to do next.
