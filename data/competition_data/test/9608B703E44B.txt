In the article the challege of exploring Venus. The author provides a claim and a counter claim to his article on why Venus should be explored. The author brings up many good points in his claim and couterclaim on the pro's and con's of inhabiting venus. Overall the author is for exploring and inhabiting Venus he brings up many good points and ways why and how we should explore Venus. Venus would a very dangrous place bur could open oppurtunities and new homes for people.

Venus is a very hot planet that has extreme presssure. Under these circumstances it may seem unhabatible and very dangerous, overall the author brings up a point on how nasa is finding a way to make it safe for people. "NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels.""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." NASA provides a way of living on nasa with blimps that would stay away from the clouds and the storms, and the extreme heat. These conditions would not be the greatest but they would work and could be a way people live on Venus.

A issue concerning Venus is its extreme heat destroring are modern electronics and making them unusable after a certain peroid. But the author provides a way that NASA is using to to use computers under such circumstances they provide that we we can use computers in Venus and that is by using old computers form the 40's and using silicon carbide."For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.""The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all." Using these types of technology can be used in Venus and can still provide calculations for people. If NASA works harder on the silicon carbide they can provide a much better piece of technolgy thst can work faster and survive longer on Venus so modern tech could still be used on Venus.

In conclusion habatating Venus would be a rough and long process of making the right equipment, maken the travel and carring so much needed for the journey all ways this process is very dangeorous to the workers and a very long journey. But overall Scientist are looking for planets to habitate and Venus could a choice down the road. The journey would be rough but is should not scare us and make us think the journey is to hard. Putting people on venus would be amazing and could open up other oppurtunities down the road that could make us do the unimagnible.
