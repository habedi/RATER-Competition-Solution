What I think about driveless cars isthat it should be allowed but it shouldnt. I think this because it would be kind of cool to have a driverless car but there will be some consequences that come with it. The person your are buying it from could persuade you into buying it but he or she could be lieing to you because its all about buisness. When my mom always says there is always a plot to something like if you buy the driverless car there could be things that could happen ,they will not tell you its dangerous. They will try to tell you how cool it is and why you need to buy it. There could be also some good things about it like being able to text and drive, eat while driving, or other things like multitasking. When you read they tell you that they are fascinating but in your eyes you see the best thing ever. So if I were to tell someone who wanted the car I would tell them to do some research on the car so they know how much they are spending and getting themselves too. After i tell thim this i will ask them if they really need this car or want it, and if they say yes and get the car later on when the car is not so good I am probably going to say told you so and they are probable going to look at me and smile. even though this BMW is a cool car the cost of it is not so cool so i think it would be both ways for me. I would say yes, but i would say not it just depened what you are really wanting to do when its out of style and no one wants the car any more. But there are even more consequences to this , if you dont take care of it it will be dirty and if you dont want to clean it the cost will be extremely expensive ,because its a cool carand more. So if i were to choose this car i might say yes.
