To the Principle

My recommend is the policy number one cause if they are going home on the bus they would have to call there parent to check in especially if they are walk even if its only ten minutes from your house you still have to call your parent or guardian or who ever takes care of you.

But only during free time like lunch cause you might be on one side of the building your friend might be on the other side, but if you like texting or communicating like answers for a test or a regular quiz.

texting in the library is ok if your doing the same thing like home then its kinda ok cause your helping each other out. Or maby there was an accident at school and you would have call a guardian, its like a safety precaution your safety is your number one priority.

But at the same time, policy number two is also a good one cause student would either talk or text instead of school work so if you take away there cell phones the student would be doing there work instead of playing around with there cell phones.

That would mean the grade levels would go up unless they find another way to communicate like letters or secrets note or some thing.
