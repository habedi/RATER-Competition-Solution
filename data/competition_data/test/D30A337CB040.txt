Around the world we are seeing drastic drops of limiting car usage. In VAUBAN, Germany cars, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in this new district. In Paris after days of near-record pollution, Paris decided to ban driving to clear the air of the global city. In BOGOTA, Colombia it has been the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis. The United States of America has even passed their peak of driving in 2005 and dropped steadily since.

Giving up your car may seem very hard to you, but for the people in VAUBAN, Germany seem to like it much better. In fact street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in this experimental new district. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys space, for $40,000, along with a home. Nearly 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars they seem to be much happier this way.

After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. On monday people with even-numbered liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a fine of 22-euro. The same would apply for odd-numbered plates the next day. Nearly 4000 drivers were fined and 27 drivers cars were impounded for their reaction to the fine.

In BOGOTA, Colombia they were in a program to spread to oher countries. They were on their third straight year that cars have been banned. Although buses and taxis were permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced a $25 fine.

I think this is a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. And this is a revolutionary change.
