Do you think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of any people is valuable? Well in my personal opinion I belive that is it valuable. Getting to know how people feel or what people are going through could be a whole lot better. Example there could be friend's that look happy from out but in thier inner sole they feel empty and if then we use the technology to detect how their actaully feeling then we can help and change their whole mood.

The use if technology to read emotional expressions of students is vauble becaus we can see when students are paying attention in class or they are fooling around. There could be many good reason in which it's good to use technology and read emotional expressions of students. " A classroom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored". Technology is reading the kids feelings and seeing if he needs help or needs to get into action.

Therefor technology feeling readers are in good use to help people who are not feeling well or who want to change up their mood. Technology feeling readers should be around and see how people are doing. If people are showing a worried face or any type of face then they can do something to help that person.

In conclusion feeling readers should be around. If it helps you it can help other people who need it. It can help in different occuison and even help the judge, police to see if the person face can shoe if he's gulity or not. It can help anyone.
