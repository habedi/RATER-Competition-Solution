Cars are a very large help for transportation. Although they do have alot of defects to our environment, our laziness, and our safety.

The first reason we should limit car use is so our environment doesn't get ruined.  The fumes our vehicles are relasing into the air are creating a large addition to the greeenhouse gases.  For an example semis, diesel cars, diesel trucks and other vehicles when you rev the gas it pours out black smoke into the environment.  When you see a truck do this you think nothing of it, but overtime and with every single car and truck that does it, it adds up very quickley.

Another reason we should limit our car usuage is because it increases our laziness.  Instead of driving to school when it's only 2 minutes away, you could just walk.  If you walked you would lose a little weight and even saving your gas money.  If you are close to the place you want to go then you might as well just walk in benfits you in many ways.  Saving money, losing weight, and getting more fit.

One of the most important reasons we should limit our car usuage is for our own safety.  Deaths in car accidents is one of the most leading causes to death now a days. would you rather walk or ride a bike to the location you want to go or would you rather risk your life by driving and somebody teboning you and injuring or even killing you.  Not that you should but some people sometimes can get into a crash with you and then just drive off. Whether it was your fault or theirs now you have to pay for the damages done to your vehicle.

If you are going to drive because you live far away from everything.  Simply car pull, it's alot easier and if everyone throws down a little money then you aren't spending that much on gas or diesel.  Riding a bike is a great solution to limiting car usuage because it's a one time purchase, once you buy the bike you don't have to pay for fuel.  Also it's better than walking because it's by far faster.

In general driving has advantages and disadvantages.  Although if you are close to your location then riding a bike would be ideal to lower car usuage.
