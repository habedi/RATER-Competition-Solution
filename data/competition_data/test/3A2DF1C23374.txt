Phones were created to alert people if a crisis were about to begin or to contact loved ones from far away for long periods. Over the years, phones have since upgraded into cell phones that can fit anywhere. They are very efficient and much lighter to carry around. Cell Phones nowadays help get minds off of certain things that disturb daily lives by entertaining the brain. Some people argue that cell phones help with safety issues but that's far from the truth because cell phones lead to serious accidents and communication problems on the road.

Without a doubt, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones on the road because it causes a lack of focus and leads to serious accidents. This is a major issue since drivers are usually on their phones all the time. For example, "the major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts the attention of the driver" (Scotti, 2007). This leads to putting the passenger at risk of injury. Along the same lines, this can be very dangerous if the driver has earbuds in his or her ear. For instance, "cell phones reduce the driver's performance"(Gravelle, 2005). The driver can be impaired and no longer able to hear what's going on, which can lead to confusion on the roads and cause the driver to make the wrong turn.

Some may argue that texting while driving is dangerous and may lead to serious injuries but, that's the opposite. Texting has proven to be the quickest way of getting work finished without having to be in the office or the school building. It's a great help with accessing the shops online rather than using a map. For example, "using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic" (Sturnguist, 2006). In the same way, this makes it easier to decide on what outfit to wear that day. Not only does it help with weather issues it can also help with navigating the quickest way from accidents. However, driving while having a cellphone in hand is still against the law, and can lead to suspension or worse jail time. People on the road believe that if they wear their seatbelt, it can protect them from accidents but this is only half correct. It provides the passenger with somewhat of a small chance of protection but a higher risk with or without it on. Studies have highlighted that "drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decisions causing serious accidents involving other vehicles" (Gravelle, 2005). This is the main reason why cell phones shouldn't be in your hands while driving. As an example, especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation and pay less attention to these areas, increasing the risk of fatal accidents.

(Gravelle, 2005) Along the same lines, people need to stop having cellphones in hand. It's going to cause suffering later.

Drivers should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it leads to serious accidents. These accidents could lead to paralyzation or death. The fact that people still do this is scary. It's highly dangerous and risky to be doing this at all. Hopefully, in the future, they will create some type of equipment to detect people with phones in hand, because if they don't more drivers and their passengers may face death and destruction.
