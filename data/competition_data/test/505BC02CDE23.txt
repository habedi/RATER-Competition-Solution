Is online schooling really school? Many school systems have been looking into online education. This is not a good idea. When students are given the oppertunity to learn at home how do they stay fouced like they do at school. Online learning presents a plethera of new challanges to over come to keep students focused. When at home students have the ability to cheat, be distracted by home issues or games and are unable to ask questions.

The first problem with online education is cheating. Since there is no teacher in the room, how are schools able to know if a student is using another device to help with with a test or worksheet. This has been an issue with oline testing even in schools because students are able to switch tabs quickly without anyone knowing. My sisters AP class is currently having that issue. Her teacher is beginning to do less things online to stay away from temtation of looking up answers. Another things to think about with cheating is, how many people are at someone's house? A group of students could all be in the same room (not on camera) and are helping eachother with a test or quiz or even a learning activity. It may seem like the learning activity will be good as a group but, if only one person is answering the questions, all the other students will not retain any of the information. The last problem with cheating is when a parent or sibiling is in the room. How are teachers supposed to keep a family form helping their child or sibiling when they are at home. A parent only wants there child to succed so, they might help here or there. With all these abilities to cheat, online learning will not be able to stop them all.

My next concern with online learning is with distractions. When at school, their are obviously distractions but, a teacher is able to aid and stop most of them. At home, the distractions only increase with no way of stopping them.Â New distractions like, I need to clean my room or the dog needs to be walked or I could watch this TV show while i'm working come into play. Even other people in the house could be distracting. A

parent may be using the vaccum, which is a loud distracting noise, or even asking for help when they are unloading the groceries that takes a student away from class. A younger sibiling may want to play a game or be having a trantrum that makes it hard to pay attation to anything else. Once a person gets distracted once, they will find another and another until they are completly away from there school work. My cousin has resenly gone to college and was finding it hard to study in her dorm due to everything else she could be doing. She found that if she went to the library or to the outside study quad, she got a lot more done. This works the same for students learning in a class or school setting rather then in a home setting.

My final reason that home and online schooling is a bad idea is with asking questions. Students need the ability to ask questions when learning. It is the only way to make sense of what is going on when confused. If a teacher is recording herself teacher the lesson and everyone is watching how will she answer questions. The teacher would have to stop ever five seconds to see if someone left a comment about what they don't understand. This would take way to long and would be distracting from learning the actual information. Another issue is that not all online videos have the ability to leave comments to communicate. How do students ask any questions at all when that is the case? They can't. Because of not being able to ask questions students will retain less and not understand more. Now, test scores will go down and more students will stop caring. This leads to all the other earlier problems like cheating and being distracted. It's hard for people to work at something when the only fail because they can't get help. This is jsut like when babies learn to walk. If a parent isn't there helping them start off, they will never learn how to walk. Online learning will only make learning harder for students.

All in all, home and online learning should not be put inplace. There are way to many things that can take students focuse off of school and put it onto anythings else. Why make it harder for students when the main goal is for them to succed?
