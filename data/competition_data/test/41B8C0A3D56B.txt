Policy 1 is better for many reasons. One reason is if a student needs to stay after for a teacher then they can call their parent during lunch and tell them and the parent won't be worried about their child after school. Also if someone needs something at home for a class after lunch they can call there parent at lunch and ask to bring it buy and they wouldn't get a bad grade. The students could call their friends that weren't at school and talk to them and tell them what was happening in class. Also if a person couldn't get there stuff in school at the right time they might be able to call home and ask to bring it to school. A student might want someone to go over their house then they could call at lunch and ask. It helps stop so many kids from asking to call on the office phones. Also there would be less sneaking around with cell phones in school. That's why students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch.
