Luke encourages people to join the seagoing cowboys program because he thinks since when he were in the program it was amazing I know this because in paragraph 5 it says the cattle-boat trips were unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy.

Also it says But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think he thinks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but he is impress how they are manaing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke trys to convince people to join this program is so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them alot I know this because in paragraph 7 it says Helping out on his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. Thats teaching him how to survive on his own he's getting taught and he is changing during this program so thats what he thinks this pro gram can do for other kids wanting to do this program.

Luke trys to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was in this program he worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because in paragraph 1 it says Luke Bomberger had no idea that hi life could change soon after his high school graduation. he was working part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think he trys to encourage people to join the program.
