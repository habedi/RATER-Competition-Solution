Dear Principle,

I believe that you should choose the first option: Let kids bring cell phones to school to use during lunch and free-times. I think we should be able to talk with people. We don't always get to see everyone, even if we are in the same school, we don't always have the same classes, and people want to stay connected. Also we can make plans and talk with parents, if we have no phone, we have to use the phone at school, and realistically, who likes doing that? -nobody I know. Also we (or sometimes our parents) are paying for cell phone use. If we pay, we should use up that time we are allowed. Lunch time is a time to eat, take a break from the school routine, and catch up with friends. Passing time is for getting to classes, sure, but lots of students use much of that time to simply talk with friends while they can. Don't you agree that these times are good for texting or talking?

Before and after is also a good time to use a cell phone, which makes it necessary to bring one to school. On the bus in the morning, unless people bring their i-pod or homework, they are pretty bored, texting is the perfect cure. The same thing goes for after school: plus then, there is much more to talk about. Basically as long as students aren't cheating, or not paying attention in class, cell phones, I believe, are a perfectly fine thing. Please, also consider that many kids will just be getting a cell phone sometime during high school or middle school. Who wouldn't be excited to use it for the first time-feeling cool, having freedom and having fun talking with people? If it's really true that you (and others in charge of school rules) want us to have fun (while learning) and have good memories of school, you would consider our wants and let students bring cell phones to school, to use during their free time. Taking away the use of cell phones is like taking away social lives. The students and I would all be very grateful if you would let us have our cell phones during school. We can learn and pay attention as well, but it is nice to have freedom during the time we have available. After all, that is why it's called "free-time" isn't it? Thank you for listening, please consider this with much thought.
