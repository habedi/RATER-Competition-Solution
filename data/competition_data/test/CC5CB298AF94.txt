When schools let out for the summer it allows students to relax and take a well deserved break from all the stress and workloads from school. However most teachers like to spoil our breaks by assigning summer assignments. If teachers are going to assign a summer assignments then I believe that they should be teacher designed. If the teachers want students to complete summer assignments then they should be the ones to design them to ensure that the students complete work that is beneficial for the class, learn topics that the teacher want them to cover, and it is the teachers job to design the work that they are assigning.

If a teacher assigns a summer assignment to help prepare their students for the class they are about to take, then the assignment should be one that is beneficial for the students. A teacher designed summer assignment would assure that the work the students are completing is not wasting their time, and will benefit the students later in the year when they are in class with the teacher. No student enjoys busy work that serves no purpose in helping them become more educated for the course they are about to take. Personally I do not mind summer assignments when I know that the assignment being completed will help me to succeed in the class. A student about to take a new class does not know the information that they will need to know in order to succeed in the class. Teachers are much better prepared to assign a summer assignment that is beneficial for the students.

If the students were tasked with creating their own summer work, then the work would be designed to be able to finish quickly rather then to prepare their selves for the class. As a student if I were told I had to complete a summer assignment, but it could be my choice of what to complete, then I would create an assignment that could be finished quickly. Rather then spending our valuable break time working on extensive summer work, the majority of students would like to spend their time having fun. If teachers are expecting the students to come to class already oriented on the subject, but give them no guidelines for what they are to be learning, then students are going to choose to come in unprepared. If I were to have to create a summer assignment for a class than I would create one that will take the least amount of my vacation time. If a teacher wants a summer assignment to be completed then they should design it for the students as it is their job to do so.

I believe that if a teacher would like for a summer assignment to be completed then it is their job to design it for the students. As a teacher it is part of their job to create the work that they are giving to the students. They are better educated, and better trained to put together an assignment for the students. It is the students job to complete the work assigned to them by a teacher, not to design the work. If students were to be given the teachers job of creating assignments, then what is the need for there to be a teacher.

While students could enjoy creating their own summer assignments, the assignments they create would be designed to be as little work for them as possible. If students have to have their breaks ruined by summer assignments, then the assignments should be teacher designed because, the assignments should be beneficial to the students, the students would create assignments that could be done quickly rather than assignments that would help them learn, and if a teacher wants to assign an assignment to students on their break then it is their job to design the assignments.
