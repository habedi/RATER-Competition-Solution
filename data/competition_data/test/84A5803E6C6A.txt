Does your child need to get out of their comfort zone? Do you want them to start talking to other people?

I agree with the principal to make all students participate in at least one after school activity because it will let students meet new people, increase social skills, and learn to have good leadership when working in a team or when needing help.

Staying after school is a great way to meet new people and make new friends. You might meet someone that has a lot in common with you, you can get away from the people your always with. This would be a really fun way to get to know people and about them. Then soon you will have many close friends to be there for you. Meeting new people isn't the only thing you will do, you would learn something important that you will need in life.

Social skills are a good thing to have in life and the best place to get them is by staying after school. When staying after school you can interact by talking to people about what they are doing or making, you can share ideas and thoughts so they know you care. You learn to also get along with people and learning to share with others them knowing that you are nice and not selfish is a good thing. You might even learn somethings that you will need for when you get older. Their is also one more good skill that you will need in life and school.

Leadership skills is something you might need for an after school activity to present or share something to the club. When having leadership skills you will need to learn to talk loud and clear in front of many people, this will be important so people can know what you are doing and they know that you are confident in what you are saying. You must also hold and support you team encouraging them to do their best, this is a good thing to do so your team doesn't just do a sloppy job but puts in 100% effort into the project. But also you can't just leave them doing all the work you need to do the most of the work, helping them when they don't understand or when they can't do something, that is what a leader does.

What the principal wants to do, to make all students participate in at least one after school activity is a good idea. I agree with his thoughts and ideas and it would help students in many ways by teaching them to meet new people, social skills, and to have leadership skills. You won't just learn few new things but you will have so much fun.
