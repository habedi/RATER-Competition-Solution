The reason he wants to join the program is that he wants to help people. Another reason is that his friend is going too! He is also going because he gets to see China, Uurope, and Europe. But the main reaon he is going is t help people and animals that are shipped overseas.

To support Luke's claim, in the text it states that, "To help these countries recover their food supplys, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of horses, yound cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."

To conclude my essay, here is some infromation about Luke and Don's journy! For fun they played: volleyball,baseball, table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games. They also played them to help pass the time. The trip also made Luke "aware of people of other countries and their needs. For Don's expirince it was almost the same!
