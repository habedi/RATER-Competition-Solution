Should we have cell phones in school

I believe that we should have cell phones in school because they are useful to us in many ways. Just imagine that you are in school now and your mother has just sent you a text that she has just gotten in accident you wouldn't have known that if you didn't have your cell phone on you during lunch. Say we weren't allowed to have cell phones in school it isn't fair to the students if the teachers have them on them and the students didn't. i believe everybody should be given equal rights whether that is to keep personal property or just the right to do certain things. It shouldn't matter if you are just a child or a adult it is righten in the constitution that everybody is given equal rights and that should mean kids as well. I don't mean that we should drink and other stuff I just mean we should be given the same liberty's as adults, this all comes down to the fact should we or should we not have cell phones. it looks like such a small thing but it could have a big impact and it gives us more independence. My father always said that the little changes have big outcomes and that's the truth if we don't make the small changes that chip away at that wall that separates us we will not be able to break it down. We are the free citizens of this country why don't we start acting like it. We are the future of this country as will the generation after us be so instead of not giving us the respect that we want why not just treat us the way we want to be treated. if it were up to me I would treat the next generation with respect because we shape this country as much as you guys do so let us be free and look at this nation as one that we respect not the one we despise.
