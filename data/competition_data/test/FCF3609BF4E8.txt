The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable beacuse i don't think the technology can tell how someone is feelings 100 percent correct. Technology can't read humans minds nor humans face so i think the use of this technology is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. It won't be good for some people who want a private life feelings if the technology is showing how they feel every time they get happy or sad.

Technology are always not smart,technology can hurt humans too they're not always helpful. Just because you enjoy using it does'nt mean others do. I think that this technology to read emotional expressions of humans is bad to use well it's my oppion i don't know about others people but im pretty sure they'll agree with me.

What if this technology brng harm to some people,its not a good idea to read people feelings some might like it but some might hate you. So i don't think this technology is valuable. It might be helpful to read students's emotional expressions but what if the students dont want that like they want they private feelings,they don't want to share with anyone only themself or maybe friends. Who want someone to going around and use technology to see what they feelings? Nobody.
