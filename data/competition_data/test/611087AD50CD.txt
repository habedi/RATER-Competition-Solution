Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that we should have a cell phone policy that lets us have our phones at school. I do not think we should be able to use them in class, because it would distract us from our work, but if you let us use them at lunch and during brakes that would be awesome.

I think we should be able to have our cell phones at school because of emergencies! What if my mom or dad has to work late tonight and I have nowhere to go, because I don't like to be home alone at night. I also think we should be able to have phones during lunch because its not hurting anything if we do. If someone's phone gets stolen or broke, its their own fault. What if one of my family members are sick and they had to go to the hospital? I would not find out till I got out of school.

Most of the kids in our class have their phones our or at least keep them on them at all times anyway. You could walk into our class and see at least one person with there phone out.

If we were allowed to have our phones we would not have to hide from the teacher if it accidentally goes off in class. Most teachers are okay with it, and just tell you to turn it off put it on silent. But then you have other teachers that freak out when a phone goes off and takes it to you. All i am saying is that, you need to highly recommend thinking about changing our cell phone policy. Its not like a cell phone could be a weapon in any way.

Just please think about it!

Sincerely,
