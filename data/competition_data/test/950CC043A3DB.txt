When people hear about banning or limiting car use they would think that's crazy. Why would the govenment ban car use? Why would anyone vote for cars use to be banned or limited? Most people ask these questions because they don't know how they would get to work or go to the store. But there are many ways to get from one place to another.

One reason to limit or ban car use is because of greenhouse gases."Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."(In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, paragraph 5) Most peple that live in heavily populated areas know what smog is and how bad it gets. Greenhouse gases are really bad fot the environment and for us. Paris is one of the cities with this problem. "[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussel and 79.7 in London..."(Paris bans driving due to smog, paragraph 17)

Another reason to limit car use is because too many people are driving and it causes stress.""It's a good opportunity to take away stressand lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos... as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botogta, paragraph 24) In colombia millions hiked, biked skated or took buses to work during car free day leaving streets with no traffic jams. ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"... media trainer and mother of two.."

When people can't use cars they dont want to walk all the way to a store that maybe 5 or more miles away. But accordint to In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, " In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."(paragraph 6) In Paris, on the days people couldn't use cars, "Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday..." if the public transportation was free then on the days we don't use cars the same could apply here.

The main reason for limiting car use is toreduce the amout of greenhouse gases. It's not that bad of an idea if you think about it. Cars wouldn't be banned forever just on certain days or untill the smog lightenes up. If Paris and Colombia and Cali and Valledupar are doing it we should too. Let's make the world a cleaner place because we only have one.
