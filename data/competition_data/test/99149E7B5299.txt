Dear, Principal:

Students are obsessed with their phones. They use them 24/7. They use their phones to go on the internet, to text, to talk on the phone, to take pictures. Most students would go into a black depression if you took away their phones, while most would be drunk-happy if you let them use it during school. I believe that you should not let students use their phones during free periods.

To begin with, if you let students use their phones during free periods, that is all they will think about. Just last week, I was sitting in math class, bored to my skull. I was thinking about how next period, lunch, I would finally be able to use my phone to text my mother to bring me a cheesecake. Mmm, cheesecake. And so there I was, not hearing a word the teacher said, my eyes desperately glancing the clock every five minutes. Of course, since I was not paying attention, I didn't hear the teacher that we had a test tomorrow. The next day, I failed. Lucky me. Last Thursday, I observed a predicament just as mine. In language arts, I was writing a paper when I heard the tell-tale buzzzz of a vibrating phone. I looked over to witness my friend Kelsey hungrily staring at her pocket, wanting to know what her phone had alerted her to. Was it a text message? A missed call? What could it possibly be! I could almost feel her fingers itching to rip her phone out her pocket. Her curiosity was eating her alive, the poor girl. Since she was too pre-occupied with her phone, she didn't hear the teacher's five minute warning, and never finished her paper. All because of a buzzzz.

Furthermore, if students use their phones during free periods, they will be more tempted to use them during class. For example, it's just like eating food, or marshmallows. Since when do you eat just one marshmallow? You don't. Since when do you text only during lunch? You don't. You text through the next class, science, and then through history, and then, if you can, even through PE. Students will be less likely to put their phones away if they are already using them at the moment. To the students, it is cruel of you to let them use their phones for only a short, forty-five minute period. But what if you send a text at the end of lunch, only to get a response during class? You just whip out your phone, respond, and put it away. No big deal. But then what if they respond again? And again, and yet again? Then before you know it, you're caught up in a textversation. (text conversation.) Notice, this isn't lunch anymore. It's their precious, educational time that the students are using.

In conclusion, I believe that students should not be allowed to use their phones during free periods because they will not concentrate during class, and they will be more likely to using their phones during class. Oh, I just got a text message. Hold on, this'll just take a second.
