i think that we do not need to have are cell phones at school because who ever have a phone is going to use them no matter what and they use them in class when the teacher are not looking and i think that we should not have them. even are i pods because ever one listens to them in class to and they do not do there work we they are told to so i think that we should not have cell phones are i pods because all most ever one. has them and they use them when they are not post to so i thing you sound just not have them at the school. and i think that we should not have them because no matter were you are at they are going to use them because they think seen you do not see they having them out in class are in the hall. they can use them so i think we should like not have them at all because some time they bother other people with them like the sound up way to loud. and the student to have there phones at school at all because they ask other people how do you work this and they say you should not have one if you do not know how to work it. and that is why we should not have them at school at all. and that is why we should not have them.
