Luke graduated from high school and his life got more complucated. After he graduated he was working two part-time jobs. His freind invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke could not refuse. After that one trip he has gone on six teen other trips. In the mean time of wating to get were he wanted to go he helped out on the ship. He feed and gave water to young houres and cattle.

Luke liked living like that. He liked to be on the move and working wile he was going some were. When he works he gets to see all sortes of beutiful and amazing things. On one trip he went to China and on anuther he went to Greece. He went througth all kinds of rivers, lakes, and ocanes.

If you are the tip of person that likes to travel this is the purfected jod for you. But if you get sea sike this is a taribble job for you. And all you have to do is feed and give water to hourses and cattle three time a day and after the hourses and cattle get off the boat you can play baseball, vollyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and you can read.

So if you like to travle over seas and like to play games. the job is just right for you and you get to go to China and Greece. And if you go to work on the boat remember luke you might just see him. Good luck working and traveling with the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.)
