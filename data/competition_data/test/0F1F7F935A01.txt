They asked should students or teachers make the summer project for the students. well I think that the students should make the summer projects for other students. The reasons why is because students can make relate able topics so that other students can understand their project more. Also because students can feel overwhelmed, scarred, or even intimidated by teachers. Another reason is it actually gives them a choice on how they want to do their project.

The reason I say the projects can be more relate able if students make them is because all students are around the same age therefor they would be more relate able. Studies show that people relate to other people that are in the same age group as them then to people who are older than them. The reason why is because they go through the same changes or situations as their peers are going though. younger people now a days go through different struggles compared to back in the day. For example a 12 year old boy plays a video game and he gets mad every time he dies but the parent doesnt understand what the boy is getting mad over it, you would need another child around the same age as the boy for somebody to understand.

Another reason why the students should make the summer projects is because some students can feel very intimidated by teachers or adults in general. Some students probably feel scared that the teacher is going to give them a lot of work. Students prefer to get less work so whats the point of giving them more? Or it could be as simple as the student doesnt like the teacher thats giving them their summer project.

Most students already feel as if they dont have a choice or a say so when it come to school. So why not let them have a little bit of freedom to let them do what they want to do on their project. I feel like if you let the students take control over the summer project it would encourage more students to do the project and actually have fun while doing it. Im pretty sure way more students would do the project if it was fun and enjoyable.

No students like doing projects especially during the summer so why not make it enjoyable as possible. What im trying to say is getting a project from your teacher is a big NO for most students. Students just want to feel like they have a choice in the matter to. In conclusion letting the students take over the summer project will encourage students to do their project and help them enjoy it as well.
