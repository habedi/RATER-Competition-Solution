Venus is one of our good neighbors. Spacecrafts have landed on Mars and researched it, but Venus is our next destination. It's been 30 years since any Earth-based object has on Venus and we got to go back again. Despite the dangers of going to this planet, we should send spaceships and astronauts to Venus because it is highly possibale that there is plenty of oceans and can support life forms from Earth.

Sending astronauts and spacecrafts to Venus is good idea because it's possible that there is oceans and other relations to Earth. In the article, the text states, "[...] Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters". Mountain Ranges, oceans, oxygen, and other landforms on Venus are close relations to Earth.

It will be very dangerous and expensive to get to Venus, but it's worth a try. This explains why Venus is the next destination because there is so many things on Earth that are possibly on Venus.
