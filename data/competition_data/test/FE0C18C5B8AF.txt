Summer Projects

I believe schools should require students to complete projects during summer break. Most students do nothing during break, so they spend their time without learning anything new. It will help students be well educated while on break. The students would be motivated to do a summer break project if it was designed by them, the students. Doing schools projects during break will give students new knowledge, they will be educated once returning to school, and having the project be student-designed would motivate them.

Most students do nothing during break, so they spend their time without learning anything. Many students are not able to travel during summer break due to money or health problems, which is why they don't look forward to summer break. If a project is assigned, the student will work on it without hesitation. Working on an important project during break will encourage students to keep learning in school and out of school. Having a project designed by a student encourages other students to do it.

The students would be motivated to do a summer break project if it was designed by them, the students. Of course they would come up with the idea, then share it with a teacher, whom would decide if it's an idea that would benefit the students. The teacher would help the student by creating some requirements for the project. The idea is to create a poster about the subject the students likes best, and it should include information about the class and why it is a class to take. That will help with how well the student knows the knowledge of the class.Â It gives them a great experience and they get educated on their own.

It will help students be well educated while on break. For the most part students do not like learning any new material, which they consider to be hard. On the contrary, learning from home gives them comfort, and they work hard to accomplish the task assigned. Designed by students, the project is an activity they can enjoy. They wouldn't make it impossible to create, so that the students don't try. It is a project where they can expand their knowledge and be as creative as possible.

In conclusion, having students design a project for summer break is a great idea. It not only gives students, who don't get to enjoy a break, something to work on. It helps provide them with more information than usual which will help them be better in school, yet it also helps students be creative. Doing schools projects during break will give students new knowledge, they will be educated once returning to school, and having the project be student-designed would motivate them.
