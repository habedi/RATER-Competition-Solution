The world is utilizing the internet for more and more every day. One way to use the internet to the benefit of potentially millions of people, is providing online classes for students. Although it would be more difficult for students without reliable internet access to attend online classes, classes accessed over the internet would be beneficial because they extend availability to more places, they would provide cheaper options to students, and they would be more space efficient.

Accessibility is one big problem when it comes to education. Students often have trouble getting to school, or finding places close to their school to stay. If their classes could be accessed anywhere internet could be accessed, this problem could be instantly changed. Students could potentially attend any school in the world if they did not have to worry about how they were goingÂ to make it to class.

Another big problem students have is finding places to stay. Whether it be finding an apartment or renting a dorm, housing solutions can be difficult and expensive. The need to find housing away from home could be eliminated if students could attend class from their living rooms or local libraries. Another benefit, is students would no longer need to pay for gas or public transit, as the need to drive to school would be eliminated.

Lastly, schools could save money, because with less students needing to be housed in dorms or hosted in classrooms, there would be less need to create or maintain these spaces. The school would not need to use funds to pay for as many materials if there are less students present to use them. Classes of students that attend in person would be smaller, so they would be easier to maintain and clean up after.

In a world where technology usage is already essential and constantly on the rise, using it to make education more accessible would be extremely easy. Students would benefit, teachers would benefit, building managers and even janitorial staff would benefit. Online classes would extend availability of schools, save people money, and be more efficient for everyone involved.
