There are many advantages when you limit your car usage. By limiting your car usage you will have to choose a diffrent way of transportation and thats often walking or riding a bike. Those two choices of transportation are often used as stress relivers. Also you dont have to worry about traffic or having to rush out of work for the gym beacause you have all ready got in a little excrise

For exapmle in source 3 "car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota" it says " It's a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,". Also when limiting your car usage people often turn to walking, or biking as i've stated before. when a city has a high populltion of walkers and bikers they will have to start making public places closer. As stated in "source 1" (¶ 6) " In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."When walking you can get a really nice excrise in when getting from place to place and riding a bike can also get your legs in shape. While siting in a car all day dosent help you out at all it's only polluting the air and has you on your butt all day. Less car driving can also mean less car wrecks.

Often people are late to work because of rush hour. As stated in "source 2" (¶14)"Congestion was down 60 precent in the capital of france". while riding a bike you dont really have to think about traffic. Another problem with driving is parking the less cars the less you'll have to worry about a parking space.
