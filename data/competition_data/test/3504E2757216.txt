Should students desighe their own project ?

If students would pick their own project to do over the summer would be a great idea. Students can pick their own subject something they would like to do over the summer,something fun that they can actually writte about and do it, something that would make the project not be chalinching for themself that they would enjoy doing it as well. Some students might be bored with nothing to do at home and not have anything to do over the summer and would want to get this project done and do it. The project can count as a extra credit for the students when back at school because that would help them a lot if they miss school they wouln't have to worry about their grade dropping back to an F. It would help the student to take their time on the project and nor get rushed do a better and detail job on it.

It's not a good idea to give work to students over the summer why becasue their most likely not gonna end up getting the work done. Their family might end up going on a trip and the students wouln't have time to get it done when there not gonna be home. They would not care about it and forget about there prejects. If the teacher would choose the project for the kids would not be a good idea it can be hard for the sudents and they would not end up diong it because it's gonna be in there summer break to enjoy and not worry about school so no students would wanna do a project over the summer.

Teachers would like their students to do a good project over the summer and not complain that they didn't have enogh time for them to get it done and to get their good work nice detailed as well or she would also just give her sudents something new to learn over the summer or something to do over the summer too.
