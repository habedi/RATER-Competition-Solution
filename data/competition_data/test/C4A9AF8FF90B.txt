In my opinion this idea that have distance learning from home have good benefit and also have unbenefit

Think that this progranm can be only for people that can not go to the school . One benefit is that people can learn in home. Also can be benefit for the people that have desirability. Unbenefit is that maybe they can not learn to much. This program can be helfull for everyone that do not go the school for any reason.

First this can be benefit for people that work in the night .Some student do not go to the schools because they do not want to get up early. Also for that reason student do not have great attendence in the schools .Student that are in this potition have this oportunity to enjoy to this manner to learn.

Student that can not go the school if they want to have better education can be in this learning in home program because it is the best oportunity.

Second, people that have desirability also can be helfull because for they are hart to transport. They can have more spesific type of learn they maybe can have more time to learn. But maybe they do not like or they do not understand the class but the teacher that they have online ca explain more to them . They need to have special type of learning . For exemplo More time , explain easy .

Third unbenefit is that maybe they can not learn to much. They will not have to much help from the teacher because if they teach online they will put spesific time to teach. If the student do not understand the leason that it is not problems for the teacher they do not care or they do not have time to explain. Student some time they think that take online classes are bored . They do not care about that

In conclusion everyone have the oportunity to have education in different manner. Some students can go to the schools but others not .For the student that can not go to the schools this is better way to have education. Something they will learn if they want they will do because never said I can not do this before try because if you want you can do .Learning online wil be helfull for some but not for everyone. work hart is better to do anything
