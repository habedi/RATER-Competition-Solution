Dear Principal,

I am against your reasoning on the policy change. i believe that students should be able to play sports unless they are actually failing a class or have bad behavior. majority of the students at our school have the average grade of a C or better. at this school having a C in your classes will still reward you with being on the honor ole. most students are capable of doing that too so why would you think about taking that away. playing sports also helps students maintain the grades as well.

If you think about that it makes perfect since because kids that want to be athletic and be involved will have to do that to stay be involved and participate in after school activities. by changing the policy i can almost guarantee you will be losing majority of the team or group. so in my defence i think you should just keep the rules as is you will be better off doing that. If we don't have enough people to play in a game you will have to for fit most of there games so your going to cut into the schools budget just to not even play anyways.

Thank you so much for taking your time to read this, it means very much to all of your students here at this school. If you could rethink your decision im sure you will not regret it because you will see how much our activities mean to us and how many students like to play in sports and after school activities here.

sincerely,

- your student body
