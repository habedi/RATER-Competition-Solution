I think it's a great idea to at least let students participate in one extracurricular activity. It would change things a lot but maybe for the greater. I thinks it's a good idea because students can participate in something they never did before, but I wouldn't say they must participate. I say it's more of a choice than to make them do it unless they willfully agree. I think this would change the school, it's students, and the students activities.

I would love to see how doing something like this would effect effect the school. It's going to be a good chance to see what he school can benefit from this. The school would definitely change because there are more students participating in things like the schools tennis team, student council, or a book reading group. Overall this would have some positive effects like more students joining more activities, but sooner or later this might get out of hand. What I mean is that id people want to join a certain group they really like they might not be able because there isnt enough room. This might not be a good out look on the school id students cant join their favorite activity.

Doing this would change the students a lot depending on what activity they do. Me personally since I've been playing tennis has changed my social life at school. Now that I'm busy practicing and getting ready for my first match coming up I dont really have time for drama and other things that can get me in trouble which is why I'm sticking to playing sports because it keeps me busy and out of trouble. Honestly this has made me a better person and i've also made friends with all the players on my team.

More students starting to join activities will have to change the activities themselves because if more students are joining more teams the teams will eventually have to stop accepting students because they might be able to fit a few more students than average but then the team would get full. That doesnt mean you have to stop there will be many other options to choose from which mean you can do anything else you like but you know if they dont have somethings you like you can always make you own group.

I think this would be a good thing to do since it can change things like the school, it's students, and extracurricular activities can benefit from doing this. I just like the over idea i think it a great opportunity the let students experience things they never did before and i total agree with the idea of letting students participate in extracurricular activities.
