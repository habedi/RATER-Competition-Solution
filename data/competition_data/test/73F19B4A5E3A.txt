The advantages of limiting car usage are very simple. For one, the amount of polution would drop.

The amount of polution would drop mayorly because with everyone driving cars there would be more polution but if we change that make people not use cars at all the polution rate would drop. The passage states, "...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent... in the United States."

Limiting the amount of car usage would help by not causing smog clouds throughout cities. Paris, France in puting a ban on driving due to smog. If people drive there they would be fined of 22-euro thats like $31. Smog makes it hard to breathe because its like if you're breathing polution and thats not good for people. As source 2 states, "cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions." that means that the car emissions stay trapped here and cant get out so what happens the we breathe that in all that smog and polution goes into our lungs and such.
