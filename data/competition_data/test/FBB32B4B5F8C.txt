Have you ever done any extracurricular activities?

Well I have, and I can honestly say playing sports and things in that nature are really good things to do.

With that being said I think that doing sports is really not for anyone.

I feel like people can not just wake up and say "I think I am going to try out for basketball today".

Our principal wants everyone in the school to do something to keep them busy.

Some students may have to find them selves before just getting right up doing sports.

Some students bodies are not quite ready to do sports. Others just may want to do get in shape.

My principal has decided that we all have to find a extracurricular.

Most of the students are not so okay with it. They feel as if they really don't want to do anything other than just got to school.

For starters one of the things that were on the list was working on our school year book.

In my eyes and some of the other students eyes we think doing the yearbook is not such a bad idea.

If anything we would need our yearbook for school memories.

When our principal is making everyone do something I feel like that is to much for the school.

Its like the whole school is trying to do three different things that are going to get filled way to fast.

Everyone involved in something may sound good but in reality it may not be the best thing.

Most of the students want to do other things and working in our school yearbook is not one.

The students feel as if it's to boring for them. To be taking the time out their days to do yearbook related things.

The students are saying that their parents may not let them stay back for other things involving school.

Most students don't want to do the yearbook anyways.

The children would rather do other stuff like play video games and eat pizza at home.

Another thing our principal wants us to do is try to serve in the student council.

Now that our principal has said that really has everyone thinking "oh I want to do this." or "this sounds fun let's do it".

The students will love to do serve because they will feel like they have the upper hand and that the students look up to them as a role model.

Plus it will have the students feeling better about them selves for a fact.

"Serving might not be so bad".

That is something students are saying walking the halls of the school building. The kids are really looking forward to doing that more then anything.

Most of the kids don't mind doing this type of work. The children believe that they can do anything and that's what the teachers are telling them. The students like love it and so would the principal. The principal will be thrilled to find out that half of the school wants to run for student council. Some of the students and I still think that basically the principal is making students do something extra. The kids that come to school everyday don't really want to do anything else but run for student council.

The teachers and the principal will see more children give up because they will feel like it's to much. But nothing is to much all the kids have to do is put their minds to it. The students will most likely say it is to much because they also have school but its okay for some students to do both not everyone can do both.

Lastly, the principal also listed that doing sports was a choice as well.

This also made the students happy probably more happy then anything knowing that their school was about to start sports.

Some children really would like to play sports.

Every student I could think of wanted to do sports.

I could not believe it!

"This school would dominate and really be on top" all of the students were saying.

If all the children honestly want to do sports they can the principal was telling the school on the intercom.

When the students try out for sports hopefully they make it so we can continue to be a great school when it comes down to sports.

Sports would really help a lot of students out. I really think it can happen!

Things like sports are good for kids to do so they can get their minds together.

When push comes to shove sports will not make you waste your time.

Stuff like that can really get a child on the right path if they have the right mentor.

If anything sports helps a lot with behavior and it would make the students want to keep their grades up so they can stay on the team.

In my conclusion I just would like to say that I do not agree with the principal decisions what so ever.

Some students may not have the time of day to stay back after school or even try to do any type of extracurricular activity at all.

All that I am truly trying to say is you have to give people time. You have to give the students time.

Something just might be going on at home and they can't do anything but come to school and try to do their work with whatever on their minds from when they left the house.

Now if the principal say that who ever wants too do anything after or who ever will like to do any extracurricular activities let me know in the main office then that is way more different from the principal just making everyone do something.

I just feel as if the principal should just allow students to speak up and say what they are trying to do and what they would like to stay back for. I don't think that the principal should make the whole school do something because like I said before the principal does not know children situationsf at home.

Nine times of ten it is something going on at home and the students would bring it to school with nothing the school could do about it.

So what I am truly trying to say is I don't like the fact that the principal wants everybody to participate in extracurricular if their's something going on in their personal life.
