I strongly believe than we should be aloud time to us our sell phones.

Because it would be nice to chat to anther friends that go to a deferent school, and it would be cool to chat to other friends on the web from your phone.

First we should be aloud time to use our sell phones to chat to friends at another school because who doesn't like to talk/ text there best friend! I know that i would love to talk to my friend that goes to a different school.

The other reason it would be nice to be able to use our sell phones is that it would be cool if we could use our phones and the time given to use them to do research.

we could have homework that requires us to do research on the computer but if we have a phone that has the internet, why wait till your home to get it done? I also think that allowing us to use our sell phones is like trust, you have to have trust that the students will listen to the rules given to fallow. That is what i believe the should happen about the sell phone issue in school.

sincerely,
