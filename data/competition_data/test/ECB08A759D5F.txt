Transportation is now used everywhere. Whether it's planes, bikes, motorcycles, or cars. Cars is our main source. They've gotten better and smarter over the years. There's ton of new ones every year. According to the article, Google cars have been developed since 2009. Google cars are smart cars. They drive independently, without having a person function it on certain conditions.

My personal opinion on driverless cars is that it's a very smart idea. Many people drive every single day, and probably get very tired of it. So why not have a break? Transportation like this may be very expensive also. I think it's worth the amount of money. In the article it explained how these cars are not completely aware of everything. So you may not want to sit all the way in the back of the car and take a nap during the ride.

The article gave a brief description on how the cars may need navigation in difficult situations. These situations could be finding its way around a car accident or a road that's getting worked on. In the article it talked about how in 2013, BMW announced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant." Now what is this? It's another car thats getting developed to drive on its own without human guidance. The car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. It can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.

So this explains that humans must be there and alert incase a serious situation may come up and they have to take over. The Google car has actually made a situatiion with the car and planned ahead with possible situations. They have a function where they simply annouce when its a time where the driver shoud take over and handle whatever is going on. If that's a problem, it has other functions to get the drivers attention. Flashing lights on windshields or noises are a few examples of the indications.

I feel that cars has came a long way, and they're getting nothing but better. I also feel that in a few years or so, everyone is going to be driving these cars. Whether it's Google, Apple, Toyota, or BMW. Smart cars are going to make a major impact. It will be easy transportation, and a luxury. They're going to keep improving and people will look back at the "classic" cars, which are the ones we drive today.
