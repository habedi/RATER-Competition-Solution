I believe that summer projects should be student-designed. I believe that because students should be able to have fun over their break and not have to worry about what the teacher picked for them to do. Also i believe this because sometimes teachers dont know what the students like to do or not. Lastly, what if the students went somewhere else for the break and didnt have any time in to doing it?.

I believe that students should be able to have fun and not to have to worry about what the teacher assigned them to do. I know since i'm a student myself that i wouldnt want to do a project that my teacher picked for me to do. Students should be able to pick the project them self and have fun with it.

Also I believe this because sometimes teachers dont know what the students like to do or not. The teachers dont really get into the social life of the students ,so its hard to say what they really like to do. I know that the teachers try to do whats best for you and that they try to help out when they can, but sometimes they just dont know what is actually best for you, so they should be able to let you pick your project.

Lastly, what if the students went somewhere else for the break and didnt have time to do what the teachers asked them to do?. If the student went out of town and didnt have any of the thing that that the project needs,then they're gonna get a zero on it even tho they was not home all summer break. However, if the student was to pick their own project, then they would've gotten it done with the things they had on their trip.

Students should be able to pick their own summer project. They should be able to pick it because students should be having fun over break. They should also pick their project because sometimes teachers dont know what the students like to do. Also students could go out of town durning the summer and not have anyof the thing the teacher wants them to do the project with. These are all the reasons why I believe that students should be able to pick their own project.
