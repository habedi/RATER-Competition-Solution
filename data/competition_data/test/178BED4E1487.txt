Venus also sometimes called "the evening star" is consider one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is considered a "twin" to Earth because it is the second planet from sun and becuse it is the closest to Earth in size and density and also the closest in distance.

Venus also neighbors other planets an example is in paragraph 2 "Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These diferences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to Venus. because Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world."

Venus has surface temperatures that are up to "800 degrees Fahrenheit" and the atmosphere is "90%" stronger than what we experience on earth. Venus also makes up "97% of carbon dioxide" so we would not be able to breath with also the planet being to hot to step on. they have also had unmanned missions on Venus for example in paragraph 2 "Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." NASA is also working on some other approaches to study Venus for example in paragraph 7 "some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamer simulating the chaos of Venus's surface aand have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."

NASA has also planned to take a look at technology called mechanical computers, how they were developed? An example would be in paragraph 7 "These devices were first envisioned in 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War 2." NASA is hoping in the future to make a sucessful test launch to Venus.
