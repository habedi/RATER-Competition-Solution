Dear principal

I think many students want to help planet Earth in many ways. I help the planet by picking up trash or by helping animals, sometimes my friends throw trash on the floor and i tell to pick it up and throw it away. Many kids want to help the planet Earth but sometime they don't show it, they look like they don't want to help but they do. I think helping planet Earth is very helpful but sometimes it cant take time from you like you have to do something else but you can because you have to help the planet. Kids don't know that you can help planet Earth at least 3 times a week you don't have to do it every day. People like adults help the planet every day hey just don't know it. I tell my parents to tell their friends to help the planet Earth and i tell my friends to tell their friends to help the Earth because its very important to help our planet because we want to protect it and keep it safe we want to go GREEN. The word green its very important because it means that we want to recycle and help the Earth, people use that word a lot like they would say "Go green" This word helps a lot because it means helping and people like to help. If i were a principal i would do this for my students and for planet Earth and i would try to help to.
