Kids all over our school system are staying up late finishing homework because they choose to do different activities, but are we willing to make their schedule more packed by making after school activities mandatory? After school activities are fun and a great way to make friends. They can increase a kids happiness and raise their connection with their school. Although after school activities are fun they should not be mandatory, from my experience students already have enough homework that fills their time, Students also may already be asked a lot of at home, and they might have other interests that the school doesnt provide.

Having to much to do every day can cause stress and anxiety. Students already have to much homework that they take home on a daily bases that it gets out of control of the amount of work they have to handle. The more and more Students have to do, it is less likely that they will choose to do home work, and grades could start to drop leading them to be unhappy or insecure and more stressed. As they continue these habits more then just flunking could happen they could start to lose friends, have a bad relationship with their parents, and become very lonely. Thats why after school activities could increase stress.

Not only do students have a lot of homework but they also have parents who expect a whole lot from them regardless of what they have going on. Parents have their children do chores like cleaning their room or their bathroom, making dinner, walking the dog, and babysitting their siblings. If that happens it leaves no free time like hanging out with friends, enjoying different hobbies and more. As they grow older all they will remember is going to a school club and doing chores their whole childhood. So we need to give students less time in a school envierment and more time with their friends.

Finally the school may not offer every thing that students are interested in. A student might be very passionate about one activities but the school doesnt offer it because its to expensive or very few people will join. Students like these would never have time to do both a school activities and an out of school option. The school wouldnt care they would think that they are doing everything right when they arent. Teens would just have to go on with their lives living without their passion.

After school activities should not be mandatory even though they may have their upsides. If it is mandatory it could cause stress and anxiety for students all over the school. There are already too many things expected from students at home that this could easily destroy a students mental health. There might not even be activities that teens like to the point where it just feels like extra school at the end of the day. Therefore after school activities should remain an option.
