Dear Principle,

I think i speak for all people when I say, "I LOVE SPORTS" and its never going to change, but I honestly think you can't play or participate in sports unless you have the grades, and so do most kids, but there are kids that dwell and need sports to get around and have the confidence of being a kid, that don't always have the grades to say that.

In my life I probably wouldn't be the person I am today without having sports, because they have got me to achieve so many things that I probably couldn't achieve on a regular day basis. Like I said before though, you have to have the grades to do it. Me, trying to be an "A" student and having the grades that can get me through school and being a well-mannered boy, having the least grade you can get to keep participating at a "B" isn't so bad, but you have to think about the whole student body. Not all kids have the grades they want, or even the grades they need to succeed. The average grade of the student body is a "C" which quite frankly could involve most of the athletes that are great and amazing at sports to get kicked off the team, and I'm not trying to say they should get off the hook, and be barely passing a class, but that the lowest standards of a principal may not fit the lowest standards for some of our students.

Also you have to think of the students lives back at home. Many kids have parents, that thinking a "C" is good enough or just fine. So you pushing them to have a "B", may disrupt their thinking process and they may complain that they may not have the brains of other kids and the thought progression of the other kids in the class that are having no problem completing their grade average of a "B", so there is some things that must be changed.

So, my idea for having as many kids on the team possible in terms of keeping them good in grades, is to change the requirements of having a "B" change to having a "C+", but have the coach keep on his players that the student can do much better and have him report his grade every week to the coach and have the coach watch the students progress in school, and most kids may argue that they cannot keep that average, well then they need to change some of their working habits and become the kid they want to be.
