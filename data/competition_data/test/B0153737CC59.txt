Today in the recent years car usages rates has been sky rocketing. "All of our developement since World war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change", said David Goldberg. Ever since the gas emissions has been causing problems and polluting the air, and causing smogs. Like in Beijing, China, and other European capitals. It is also almost 50% of the green house gas emissions in Europe in car-intensive area in like the United states!

There can be a solution to this situation..... Car free days! While of the exception of plug-in cars. This helps promote alternative transportation and reduce Smog and a polluted atmosphere. "Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday", "The smog cleared enough on Monday" said BBC.

Or automobiles can be banned completely. Like in the Suburbs Vauban families do not own cars and 57% of families sold their car to move in Vauban. Drive ways and home garages are forbidden generally. By this action stores are placed walking distances rather than a long distance like a highway. Cars can be allowed but only can park in only to places, large parking garages and where a car owner buys a space of $40,000 with there payment of a house! Thats a lot of money.

It is your choice would you rather be fine $40,000 for a parking space along with your house. Be fined every time you decide not to take part in the car free day to help pollution from car emissions. Or do the right thing for you,your family,your kids and your world. To help decrease the usage of automobiles. Lower the stress and air emissions.
