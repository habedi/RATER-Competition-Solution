Dear Principal,

I think you should go with policy 1. You never know what will come up, so it helps to have a phone with you at all times. In this world that we have now, it's never save outside. As long as they have them off during class it should be all good. But if they have them on and reading a text message or something with their phones then it would be alright for them to take their phone away. There is new technology in the world, and the cell phone is one of them. It would be hard to keep it away from a young person. Policy 2 is not that bad of an idea either but you got to think of what the students want too. Not just what the teachers and you want.

Young people are having fun with all of these new things. You have to let them try things out. It's not all about education all the time. If that was true everyone would be boring and the same. Not different and unique. Everyone has something that makes them different form everyone else and to make them special in their way. The people of America, and the rest of the world are never alike, and never will be. They may have something's in common but face it, no one is the same. You have to think, if I was young in this time period going to school, would i want my principal to be like this?

It's a never ending question. It's always how would you like it. So you have to ask yourself everyday, am I helping out the students or am I just doing this because I like my job? If you are a principal you would be here for the students not because of the money you earn from working. The reason you would work around kids is because you like them not hate them. So if you were a student and your principal was thinking of this, what would you want them to do?

So now you got two choices. Policy one or Policy two? It's your choice not mine. But I know I would pick Policy number one. It helps everyone out. It's why they made the cell phone. Think of this, is it beneficial to others or is it just a horrible idea? Are you making the world a better place by your choice about cell phones? How would this effect the students education? would they be distracted? How might you feel if you weren't able to have your phone on during work if you had someone at home who needed something? Don't just think of the education, because everyone learns everyday. Nothing will change that. You learn from your mistakes don't let this be a mistake that could have been prevented.

It helps if you ask others what they think. Ask the teachers, the students, the parents, the school board and ask your self. It don't just affect you, it affect's everyone.

Thank you for your time. I hope you will consider all your choices!
