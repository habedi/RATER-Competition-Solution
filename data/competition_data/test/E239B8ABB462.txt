Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment.Â  For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. Becasue of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will recieve a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.
