Dear Principal,

I would like to state I have a few opinions on the subject of you planning to change the way our school should run. I am concerned about this certain requirement. I have an understanding that you seem it is a right idea to change our schools requirements to be eligible to participate in sports and activities here at school. We must have at least a B average to participate in the school sports and activities, but most students have at least a C average.

Students should not be required to have a certain grade to get exercise from sports and activities. Us students need exercise at our young age to keep us healthy. If you think about it, most students go home to eat and watch T.V or play video games, they plan on coming to school to run their usual course in athletics. In this day and age school students only get exercise at school. If you require students to have a certain grade then your risking their health.

In our young lives we need the exercise from our schools and shouldn't need a certain grade to get fit and some what healthy. Students are at risk if you plan on them having a certain grade point average to play sports and join activities. My opinion towards should there be a certain grade to play sports and join activities, is that it is a bad idea. Exercise is a vital thing our young lives need to have. The rules should stay the way they are at this moment.
