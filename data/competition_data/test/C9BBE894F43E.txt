Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Responsibility of Texting and Driving

Cell phones are everywhere! Everyone has a phone or some type of electronic device. These devices are very useful, but they can also be a distraction. Driving is a freedom that many people look forward to obtaining in their lives, but it is also a major responsibility. Some things go together, like peanut butter and jelly, but cellphones and driving are not a good match.

Driving and texting is one of the number one causes of traffic accidents.

Drivers should not be able to utilize their cell phone at any time while operating a vehicle because it distracts them from the road and decreases their awareness.

Cell phones can be useful while driving, but they can lead to distractions. Many people use cell phones to get directions when they are lost or stream music.

The apps that are used to give directions and to listen to music are great, but the notifications from other social media apps can be a major distraction. According to the NY Post, "Americans check their phone on average once every 12 minutes - burying their heads in their phones 80 times a day" (NYP).

This study was done in 2017.

People check their phones more now than they did back in 2017 because there are more apps that people can download on their phones.

If phones were just used for giving directions or listening to music while driving, it would be okay, but everyone does not think to turn off their notifications so their phones become a major distraction. Therefore, it is a safer option to just not use the phone at all while driving.

Not only are phones a major distraction, they decrease awareness and slow a person's reaction.

When a person is driving, they have to pay attention to their surroundings and quickly respond when other drivers drive recklessly. If someone is on their phone, their awareness is decreased and they do not respond as quickly as they would if they did not have their phone in their hand.

The only thing that drivers should be focused on is the steering wheel and road.

In the end, using a phone while driving can cause accidents because it is a major distraction and it decreases awareness. When people use their phones and drive, they are putting their life and the lives of other people at risk. Even the most aware drive can get distracted by their phone. Using the phone for just a few seconds while driving can result in a major accident that could kill multiple people. The safest option for everyone is to simply stop, park, and use the phone.
