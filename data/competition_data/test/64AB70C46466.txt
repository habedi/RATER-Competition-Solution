Bob is out drinking with his friends, he decides that he should go home and get ready for work the next day. Bob gets in his car and heads home, not realising how under the influcence he was, he does not notice the semi taking the corner and Boom, Just like that Bob is dead, his wife has to get a job and his kids are missing their father. It could have all been prevented with the introduction of driverless cars. Autonomous cars are more reliable, more effective, and safer than modern vehicles.

Autonomous cars will be much more reliable than common cars. Google has had cars out that have been semi-independent sine 2009. While the cars do have drivers for some issues such as complicated traffic the car does the majority of the work. With slight developments the cars have the potential to be fully autonomous. One easy solution to this is to simply have the cars GPS connect to the local news studio and hire people in that building to update the GPS to show heavy traffic and road work so the car can just avoid them.

Recent developments have made the cars more effective as well, for example they would offer much more flexibility than your avarage bus. The bus has a set route of stops and pick ups, wherein the car could pick people up at the bar and take them safely home. This not only reduces the amount of tickets, but it also saves lives. Think how great the world would be without people dying to drunk driving. Not only that but the cars also consume less gas and require less people.

Speaking of people, The cars would be much safer than your avarage taxi, people never know the whole story behind a cab driver. It's possible that a cab driver isn't a certified cab driver, found the taxi sign at a junkyard, painted his car yellow. This leaves people in a dangerous spot when calling a cab on the streets of new york. A driverless car could pick people up and there would be no danger for the user. Another part that makes the car safer is that it can sense things better than a human can. This cars are outfitted with a massive quantity of sonars and sensors to check for other vehicles. Not only is the car safer for the person inside it is also safer for everyone else. A smart car will never have road rage, as it is a computer, without the capability to feel it will never get angry. A smart car won't run people off of the road because its feelings got hurt.

In conclusion, Autonomous cars are very reliable, effective, and safe. Think of all the Bobs in the world who because of one bad decision have not only lost their life but ruined the lives of those who loved them. it is possible that autonomous cars can prevent it from happening in the future. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes such cars can fundamentally change the world. Do you want to help change the world for a brighter safer tomarrow.
