Everyone at school should and will participate on a school sports team. You may not be the most athletic or social person. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't participate. Because you never know you may find something you really like. Here is why everyone should participate in a school sport.

Some people choose not to participate or try out for a school sport. This is only hurting them. When someone chooses not to participate in a school offered sport such as football, softball, volleyball, or lacrosse. They take a risk of not getting the physical activity they need. If they don't get the exercise they need they may become very unhealthy. They are even also missing out on opportunity's to make new friends.

When students choose not to participate in sports. They may be missing out on some valuable life long friendships. From personal experience I know that if I didn't start playing softball I wouldn't have some of the friendships and memories I have today. With the people I have become friends with i'm sure that we will stay friends, through high school and even college as we grow throughout softball careers together. So if you think you aren't good enough still tryout because you never know you could make friendships that last a lifetime.

School sports are again a good idea for everyone. Parents may think that it is not a good idea to play sports because it is dangerous. Even though they think this kids will have fun and make memories. Parents also might say "not every single kid wants to play sports!" That may be true but another sport they can play if they don't enjoy high contact, fast pace sports is competitive chess. Or they could make a new club where they can incorporate stuff they like and make up a new sport. That they would enjoy more than the other sports.

With the options an evidence given, it is a good idea to play sports. Because, it makes kids more physically active, creates new friendships, and allows kids to have the fun they can't have during class. A principal should make kids play sports because it can be fun and educational at the same time. And lastly it teaches them how to be good people and shows them valuable life skills and lessons.
