Frisbee, video games, art, coding, cooking, and soccer are only some of the many options of extracurricular activities that you can take part in. Extracurricular activities require no sign up and no prerequisite, which is great for new students, for they can do it even if they have no prior skills or knowledge related to the activity. I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows students to socialize and collaborate with their peers, as well as meet people with the same interests. All while doing an activity they enjoy.

Taking part in an after school or extracurricular activity lets you socialize and collaborate with friends you may already have, or students that you haven't met yet. Either way it's a great way to have fun and build a better relationship with your peers. Communication and collaboration skills are some of the most important skills in life. Going to extracurricular activities lets you practice and use those skills. Additionally, when students work with peers they share the knowledge and skills that they already have with each other, so in addition to what they're learning in the activity, they are learning new things from each other.

Extracurricular activities give students the chance to meet people with the same interests;

attending one or more of these activities allows students to engage with one another.

This is good because some students can be shy when trying to make new friends because they can't start a conversation.

Extracurricular activities gives students that are more shy the opportunity to talk to one another and begin a friendship, because meeting people with the same interests as yourself are a lot easier to talk to. This can all happen while playing a game of chess, basketball, or other extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity should be a simple decision because these activities are a great way to practice life skills like communication and collaboration. As well as the perfect place to meet people with the same interests. This will also provide students who are more shy the opportunity to talk to their peers, make friends, and create friendly relationships with the people around them. Therefore, I believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they aren't forced to.
