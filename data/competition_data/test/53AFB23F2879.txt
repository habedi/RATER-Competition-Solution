Students have hardly any free time because of the school principal's decision to make every student participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students are very busy.

Students have very little time to rest or relax.

The principal's decision will drastically change the lives of students.

Students have many activities to do throughout the day.

The principal should not have made the decision to make students participate in an extracurricular activity because many students play on travel sports teams or have a lot of homework.

I disagree with my principal's decision to force all students to participate in an extracurricular activity because students participate in activities not connected to school, students are busy or have something else to do, and many students have little time with their families.

The principal should not have made every student participate in an extracurricular activity because many students participate in activities not connected to school.

A large amount of students participate in travel sports.

Travel sports teams have practice most nights of the week.

They travel long distances to participate in games or tournaments. The competition in these games is really high.

The principal's decision to make students that play travel sports participate in an extracurricular activity could put too much stress on the students.

Many students also take classes outside of school based on their interests.

Students could be forced to give up their classes because they have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

A large amount of students join clubs or groups outside of school.

Students enjoy being in clubs with their friends that do not go to their school.

Because of the principal's decision, students could be forced to give up their club and join one connected to their school.

Students could be forced to give up many activities because of the principal's decision.

Students are also busy and have something else to do besides an activity connected to the their school.

Some students take advanced classes and need a large amount of time to complete their homework.

These students will have less time to complete their work.

This could put a lot of stress on students.

Many students have responsibilities at home.

Some students have to take care of younger siblings or do chores.

Students may not be able to complete the tasks their parents ask of them.

Some students are dedicated to a sport or skill.

Those students spend hours at night training for their sport or their skill.

These students should be allowed to train as much as they want and not be forced to give this time up to participate in an extracurricular activity.

I strongly disagree with the principal's decision because students are very busy and have many things they have to do.

Students have hardly any time to spend with their families.

Most parents work all day and they have very little time to spend with their children.

Because of the principal's decision families may have even less time together.

Many extracurricular activities take place at night.

That is the time most parents get home from work.

Students also have less time to see each other because of the long school day. Before the principal's decision, students had hardly any time to spend with siblings because of school.

Now students have even less time with siblings because they have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students also had little time with their family because of activities not connected to school. Today, students have even less time because they have to participate in activities connected to school and activities not connected to school.

The principal should not have made this decision because families have little time together.

I do not agree with the principal's decision to make every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because a large amount amount of students participate in activities connected to other organizations, students are extremely busy and have many things to do, and only a small part of students' days are spent with family members.

The principal's decision could negatively change students' lives.

Students may also be really tired because of this new decision.

Students may not be able to keep up with everything they have to do throughout the day.

Because of stress students' grades may deteriorate.

Students also have little free time to sit down and rest.

Students have barely anytime to spend with friends or to relax with family.

The principal's new decision could give students too much stress to handle.
