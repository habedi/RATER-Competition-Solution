Summer projects should be fun and based off the student's skills and knowledge! Schools should require students to do summer projects based on how they design there projects how they like it, not based on how each teacher designs it.

To get in more depth, students should have there own options on how they want to design there projects. Some examples would be on poster paper, video, powerpoint, etc. They would have endless amount of options to choose from. They can choose what they feel the most comfortable in. Let's say if someone feels agitated and they don't want their own project to be on video. That's ok, it can be designed how they want it to look, and that's all it matters.

To add on, since the students are the ones who are creating these projects. It would make sense to students themselves becuase that's what they have learned, based on there projects and the information they have learned on there own. If the students were ever to teach each other, I think it be great to hear another voice, meaning students can learn the material from each other better. Rather than having to hear from there own teacher like an average normal school day.

Some people can disagree with this, student's summer projects should be teacher designed instead and not student designed. I think that having student's summer projects being teacher designed is good, becuase there would be certain instructions you need to read and follow. No need to think or plan out your project, just do it based off what the instructions are asking.

However, I still stand on that student's projects should be student designed, what information they have learned, so they can be able to teach each other. That would make them most likely understand the subject more clearly!

To conclude this statement, this is why student's summer projects should not only be fun and student's getting to help one another, but also on each student's individual skills and knowledge!Â
