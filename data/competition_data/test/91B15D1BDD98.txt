Dear Dr. Principal,

In my years here, I've noticed that a considerable amount of my friends have started community service, and our town is benefiting from it. The local are is a lot cleaner, and my little brother, who's class had a few tutors from our school, told me that everyone's grades were going up.

I recently heard that you want to require all students to complete acts of community service, and I think it's a great idea. If these few people are making this big of a difference, think how much our entire school could do!! I believe that with the student body helping the entire community could drastically change the healthiness of our lives. Plus, if all the elementary students who needed help had tutors, there grades could shoot up, and therefore, we'd have less failures to deal with.

While some students may not like this idea, mainly because they don't care, I, along with many others, think your idea is great, and could benefit the entire town. If you think about it, a better environment makes for better people.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
