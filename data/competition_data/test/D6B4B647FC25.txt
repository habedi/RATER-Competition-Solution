You ever get a project that you have to do and you never know where to start? School's ending, you and your best mates are talking to each other, deciding what to do in the summer and finally relinquishingÂ the fact that you've made through the school year again. However, there's always that pesky thing that you fear most, school work during summer break. Maybe it's beneficial to you, and they want to make sure you aren't behind in a class or fail next year. But what kind of project is it, is it a do it yourself or a "do it yourself"? So you're naturally stuck, sitting there at your desk, thinking about how to get this over with so your mom can turn back on the internet to your room. Or so you think, you wouldn't have to be, if your teacher told you what to do, and you finish it without a second thought and it's off until the cows come home. Summer projects should be teacher designed due to most students not wanting any work over break, students might get huge amounts of stress, and students can take less time finishing it.

Rarely students want work over the break, most don't want to think about school work. Yes, work is work and you still have to finish it because school, but no kid wants to think about work during their own break. If it were teacher designed, at least they have some sort of guideline to follow so they just have to use a little bit of their brain. For example, if it were teacher designed, students can look what at they have to do, finish it, and go hang out with their friends. If it were student designed, students would have to think about what they have to do, finish it, and by the time they're done, summer is over. No one wants to have that happen to them, because they want to enjoy themselves and save the project for maybe near the end of the summer.

Stress, something that comes naturally, and something you should not obtain from an outside source. If students have to do their own project, their stress goes up by a lot. When students go out during their break, let's say to the mall or something, they have to remember in the back of their head that they have that project to stress over about. Stress is still going to be there whether or not it's student-designed or teacher-designed, but at least with teacher-designed, it would be a lesser amount of stress unlike if it were student-designed. For example, if students were out hanging with each other, then one realizes they have to go home and finish their project. They get home, pull out their project and if it were student-designed, they'd be stuck there all day, worrying about the project, which adds to more stress. If it were teacher-designed, students would finish in a heartbeat and go back to hanging out with their friends, because students don't have to know what to do, because the teacher told them, what to do.

Time, a very limited resource that you either waste, or spend wisely. It is not something you should be spending on thinking about a project. Both teacher-designed and student-designed take time, teacher-designed just takes less time. You could very well spend that time on doing what you want to do with your time, not something you don't want to do with your time. For example, if the project were teacher-designed, you can finish it whenever you want to finish it and it'd take less time, if it were student-designed you would have to think about it more, which takes more time, so you wouldn't be able to do a good job on it if it were at the end of summer break. Whenever I receive a project, I always say "why do I have to do this," if it were student-designed. If it were teacher-designed, I'd say "Oh, a project, well at least I have something to follow," Also with student-designed, no examples, so more time wasted trying to figure out what to do.

So you finally finish your project, but at what cost? The amount of more work you had to do, the amount of more stress added, or the amount of more time wasted? At least if it were teacher-designed, you can get rid of those mores and it'd just be a negligible amount. So why waste extra time when summer break should be time to yourself, and why worry about thinking on what you should do, when your teacher already thought out for you? Don't waste yourself worrying about some project that you have only yourself to rely on, have a project that's already thought out for you, you just have to finish it.
