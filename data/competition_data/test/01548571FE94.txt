the author that evaluates how well the author supports the idea that studying venus is a worth pursuit despite the danger. by saying " nasa is working on other approaches to studying venus for example some simplified electronis made of silicoin carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating".

This evidence support my claim because the people are studying for big things like how well studying venus is a worthy persuit.

Another claim that evalutes how well the author supports the idea that studying venus is a worth pursuit despite. In paragraph 8 it says" striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has vaule. Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself.

which exsplain that studying venus is a worth pursuit despite.

The conclusion I have about " the challenge of exploring venus " was . It seem like if u study it its a good thing . because its very important to nasa it says that in the reading . so maybe if u do it you would be succesful.
