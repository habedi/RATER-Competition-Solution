Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think community service is a very good thing to do whether your in school or not. But I really think that community service should only be for students that want to help out. Others may not want to help at all. But that's not on the teacher or principal to tell you to do community service because as a student you have the right to voice your opinion on what you want or don't want to do. So its really up to you to do the right thing. if you may not want to then fine its a choice not a demand.

Other examples are like if you do community service you get extra points on your report cards. Or on grades. There many ways to do community service but the topic of choice I choose is on school. This is how i feel about community service and how it should be handled
