Driverless Cars are the furture of the automoblie. No crashes have happened to googles smart cars so far. They take up less gas, saying "The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis." Those are just two of many reasons why driveless cars are going to change America.

The small amount that driverless cars have actully driven there hasn't been one issue with crashing into other objects. Yes there are still bugs that still need to be fixed. The cars can not at this time pull out or pull in a driveway, they also can not tell when road work is happening or when there has been a crash on the road. All things when they first start are a little bit buggy but that doesn't mean in two to five years that things could get fixed. When those bugs do get fix we could see a crashless world.

In the artical they are talking about a driverless taxi's sevice, that is more cost friendly and more flexable than the buses. Gas isn't high cost like it use to be but when you're driving people from one part of town to another side, the gas bill started to stack up. Driverless cars always take the shortest route and are just more gas friendly then your average taxi. Cutting that gas bill in half will safe more money to put back into your company or the communtiy. Gas had always been in high demand the driverless car could stop that.

The only thing keeping us from those driveless car in the laws and the bugs that they do have but again in two to five years both of those could have change the way we see cars forever. The prices of gas will fall, there will be less driving issues. The world has we know it will be safer and less popluted with less Co2 coming from every oned cars.
