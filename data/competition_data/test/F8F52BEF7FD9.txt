Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think the students should still be able to play.

as long as they don't get in trouble at school, but there are a lot of distractions when you play sports.

Some students are worried about the big game than the big test so i don't think what you are stating is correct. there are lot of people that would agree with me. I am a athlete my self and i love to play sports and I agree that grade are good but, I do not think that would be in the best interest in the schools sport program. I have a lot of friends that are athletes, and they have trouble keeping a c average and they are going to be failing in school if you but more pressure in them. So by making this a rule u will have a lot of people upset with you and that is not good for your reputation and your job at the school will be in danger. I hope my point means something to you and it put something in your mined to change what you said or at least think it though.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
