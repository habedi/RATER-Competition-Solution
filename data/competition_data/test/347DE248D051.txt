Students you should do at least one extracurricular activity! It's very important to do extracurricular activities because you can find out the hidden talents and gifts that you might have. Furthermore, I have done many extracurricular activities in my life to search for what I might be good at and that lead me to swimming! The extracurricular activities I do gave me something to look forward to in life. I agree with the statement that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's important that they dont just stay at home and do nothing, when they could be doing so much more in their life.

First, extracurricular activities can help expand your options in life. One way extracurricular activities can expand your life options is by helping you make friends. If your shy or have trouble making friends a extracurricular activity can help you because over time you will get closer to your new friends and end up becoming a family. Next, it can help you with collage applications to get into your dream collage because they will be able to see all the things that you have done and achieved from your extracurricular activities. They'll believe you will be able to accomplish many great things. In addition, getting into a collage will help you get the job that you desire. Moreover, the workplace you will choose will have interviews, see your application and also acknowledge the things you have achieved as well to make sure that you are a good candidate and can get the job done.

Second, when you do extracurricular activities you will have something to achieve and accomplish, which will make you feel joyful that you have done something in life. Also, sports or another activity is a very good way to accomplish or achieve something because it can help you look forward into getting better. When you do an extracurricular activity and there is a meet, game or contest for the activity you're doing your family will be there and cheering you on. Furthermore, you will be able to tell your friends or family about this great thing you have done and they will support you and be proud that you have achieved your goal. Which will make you happy and proud of yourself that you've done something. Later in life when your skill from the extracurricular activity comes into play and your the only one that is capable on how to do it you will be able to save the day and you won't regret that you did the activity.

Third, extracurricular activities are something that can help you get away from life. They will be able to let you distress and relax from all the frustration you have going on. As soon as I jump into the pool I let all my worries and things that I'm stressing over about wash away from me and I instantly become more relaxed. Also, as I become more relaxed my attitude and tone gets better and that way I won't say things I don't actually mean. Extracurricular activities can help you take your frustration and stress out into something good like working hard.

In conclusion, I agree with this statement that all students should do one or more extracurricular activities because it's important to stay active and do things. When you do extracurricular activities you'll be able to find out the many gifts or talents you might have. Next, I've done lots of extracurricular activities in my life so far to find the things I'm good at. The extracurricular activities that I am doing give me something to look forward to in life so I can feel like I've done something in my life. Therefore, extracurricular activities are something important you should do and be grateful that you have the opportunity to do it. Finally, don't waste these chances on silly electronics and get out there and find out what extracurricular activity you're good at and will learn to love!
