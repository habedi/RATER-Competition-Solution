Dear principal,

I strongly suggest that you let us use our phones during the free times during the day. Not only would it help you popularity as the principal but you would fix one of the major problems at the school. We break the rule you have in place already so why not keep more kids in their classes instead of suspension? One of the most re-occurring problems is that we have as a school is texting during class. The main way you thought you could fix this problem is by threatening to suspend the kids caught texting. But look where that's gotten us. If you just allowed us the lunch period to text our friends and families we could avoid all of the problems that texting during class causes. You have to admit with your job most of the kids at the schools don't really like you. It just comes with the job. it's true, and i think that deep down you wish you had our trust and compassion. So if you put this new rule in place you would become more popular with the whole student body. All I'm asking for is an hour a day to use our phones. Heck if it's only for one day a week that's still better than no days. Go ahead ask around, but I'm pretty sure you are going to get the same answer: give us time on our phone!

Sincerely,

A concerned student
