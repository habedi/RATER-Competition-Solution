How many of you guys can agree that no one likes to do projects, homework, etc over the summer, I know I hate it. Although sometimes it's required so we have to do them no matter what. Theres only one thing that can make it ten times worse then that which is when your teacher picks your project. I feel like summer projects wouldn't be as bad if students got to design there own projects instead of having the teacher choose it for them. If projects were designed by students they would most likely actually complete them the students most definitely wouldn't feel stressed or overwhelmed because they would be able to work at there own pace and lastly, students would enjoy it more the would probably put in more time and effort.

Most students turn in there work but we all know that theres that handful of students that don't like to turn in there work it could be because its too hard or they dont understand. How many times have students been able to do something for them self, projects almost never so teachers wouldn't really know how students might be doing other then the homework that they provide. If students got the chance to do there own thing teachers would certainly get more feed back to see where the kids are and what theyre good at and what theyre not so good at. Many students work at a different pace then others by allowing them to choose the way they want to do they're project would make it a lot easier and more fun for them. They'll be able to take it at theyre own pace and they will have more fun doing the project.

When students hear the words projects, test , etc they often feel stressed or overwhelmed. Teachers often don't see that, they just throw the work at them and expect them to be done on time but they don't know how student often like to work. there are many ways that students work some students like to make or build stuff others just like to write or draw there are several ways people can work. Students also have a life outside of school teachers dont know what they go through at home if they have any problems going on or anything. I think in my best opinion that maybe once in a while students should get the opportunity to make there own work so teachers can reflect off of them. It's not just going to make it easier for the student as well as for the teachers theyll just have to grade the work while the students assign they're own work. teachers should always take this stuff in consideration.

It"s not super easy to be a student all of us have been there and we know what it's like. Students sometimes will turn in a paper or homework last minute and it's often turned in with half effort. some students dont try as much as others or at least they try but they have to much on there plate to balance. Other students have more advantages then others some have sports during the summer or camps or even jobs, these types of stuff are the things that could prevent them from having the necessary time to get all of there stuff done. If students didn't have so much going on in there lives now days all these projects and work would be so much more time manageable. If students had the time and resources that they need I trust that those projects wouldn't be effortless. The teachers are the only ones that can change that that way the students have more fun doing it they would also set aside more time and put in all the effort they got.

In conclusion these are the reasons why I think that students should get to design there own projects.

students would definitely get it done because they get to work at there own pace. They wouldn't feel as stressed or overwhelmed because they would be able to work in the specific way they feel is best for them. lastly they would enjoy doing they're projects because they would be able to balance everything out they would be more motivated to put more time and effort into there projects knowing that it can be done the way they'd prefer.
