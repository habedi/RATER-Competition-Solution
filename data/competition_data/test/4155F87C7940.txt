Dear TEACHER_NAME

I would think it would be wonderful if you decide to require the students to do community service but, I think your should only require the older students to do community service. I say this because a lot of the younger students aren't as mature as the older ones. When i say older I mean around 13 years and up.

I also say you should require it because all teenagers basically do is go hang out with friends, go on facebook, watch television, and eat. That is a everyday thing for an average teenager. Teenager are very lazy and that's not a good thing they need to get up and start helping out in their community instead of being lazy all the time.

Wow ! this is an great idea you came up with. If you were to do this I would want to work with children. I love to work with kids they are so fun and they keep me going. Well, TEACHER_NAME I hope I said something to you that would make you really decide to make community service official for SCHOOL_NAME Students.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
