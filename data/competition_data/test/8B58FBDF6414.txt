To the Editor,

Excuse me TEACHER_NAME i disagree with the policy about the sports and activity.

I don't think that the students with a B grade average should be the only ones to play sports and participate in the activities. What if the students with a C grade average are not athletic and don't want to participate in any activities that will take place. I don't understand the big deal. Some of the students with a grade C average are very athletic or like to participate in the great activities that our school will have. Maybe u should change your policy about the sports and activities. Maybe u should change it to a grade C average. This will not only make much more students happier but it will also bring more students to come forth and participate. You will more players for your teams and more people in activities groups. Thank you for listening to my thoughts and what i had to say.
