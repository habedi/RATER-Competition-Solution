Dear principle,

Imagine kids finally paying attention in class. Wouldn't that be great! I believe you should follow the first policy. Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during luch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off. This is going to take affect as soon as possible. This will happen in SCHOOL_NAME

school.

I believe that you should follow policy number one because maybe if it is important they can take the call or the text message during the lunch periods. for example my good friend is a textaholic. She loves to text. If you allow using phones during lunch periods maybe she wont have to get written up for using her phone in class.

Every day a student here has to argue for their phone back. It is getting on my last nerve so much that sometimes i have to argue back at the security! Maybe if you let us text we won't have to disrespect the teachers n this school. You already took every fun thing out of our lifes why cant we just have a little bit of fun and text during lunch periods?

Every day a parent has to come in and get a students phone back. Aren't you tired of these students not listening to you? Just give them a break and let them use their phones! what is a kid going to do bad with a phone? Is the kid going to threaten another school mate wit a phone? I don't think so. Are kids going to throw phones at other kids heads for the fun of it?

You need just a break. If you keep making up new rules then more students are going to disrespect you and not follow the rules. Instead of letting them not use their phones you should give them a certain time when and when not to use their phones. If you were us students wouldn't you feel the same way?? Reconsider letting us use our phones and we promise we will make it our worth while!
