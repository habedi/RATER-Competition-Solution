I think students should be required to do community service especially if they got into trouble like suspension from school altogether, detention (but not for just talking in class, late, or chewing gum) or ISS. Some students need to do community work because of trouble with the police so they can do some to help out around the school and get graduation credit at the same time.

Some students have football practice or cheer practice etc. so they cant, but some students just sit around doing nothing after school and the weekends and get their self's into trouble. You should be required to do so many hours a month, but if you cant reach the hours required because of family problems or practice, students can get a note from their parents or coach on why they didn't meet the required number of hours for that month.

If they cant meet the required hours of community work month after month after month, there should be a punishment. Punishment could be whatever number of hours they did reach they have to make up the next month including that month's requirement. But if their is a punishment there should be a reward as well like 5 months of community work in a row get a month off or whatever the principle thinks is a good reward.

Some students cant because of work, or babysitting or something like that, so that should be there community work. They can also do things around school during the day for community work if they cant do others because of work or other after school things they cant get out of.

Some students may have a hard time finding work. At the end of the year some teachers need help cleaning out their class rooms or cleaning the desk so if students cant find work to do they can help out the teachers at their school. They can also help the cafe clean up the tables, sweep, mop, etc.
