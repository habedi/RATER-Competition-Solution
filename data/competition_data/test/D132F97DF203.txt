I agree that the facial action coding system to identify humans emotions. These are some of the reasons that i agree with the facial action coding system "a classroom computer could recognize whan a student is becoming confused or bored" this could allow the teacher to help them with out the student feeling like he/she are the only one not to understand and this could allow them to get help from the teacher. Another reason is

"if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow". the computer well give you things that you enjoy on your screen so you can be interseted to buy something. This is a reason i think that the facial action coding system is a bad ida for the computers "then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles" you really want a computer knowing everything about you for an example how you are feeling today. what kind of thing you like to watch or the things you are interesed in but also this computer understands you like no one does. and this is why i think the facial action coding system is a good idea
