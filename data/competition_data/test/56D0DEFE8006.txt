Cell Phone Policy

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think Policy 1 is a better choice. So, when students use their phones in free time, when they go to class they don't need to use the phone anymore because they already used it. If a student needs to talk to a parent they don't need to be texting them during class they could just wait for some free time. Most students are tempted to use their phone because their not allowed. If phones were allowed they could just wait to use it during free time and not during class time. It will also help students pay attention during class and not at their phones. Even if phones weren't allowed, students will still bring them. So, if we allow phones it will save students from getting in trouble with teachers or with the principal. Parents will also be able to talk to their children to see if their okay. So, if we allow this policy it would help students, teachers and even parents. That is why i want you to allow Policy 1.
