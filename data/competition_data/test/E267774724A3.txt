Dear, principal

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME, and

I have been going to SCHOOL_NAME for three years. I am writing this letter to you because you are considering on changing the school policy so the students who have a C average can not play in school sports. i do agree with you for many reasons.

There are people that think they can just get a scholarship to any collage because they played sports. They need to start and realize that education is a big deal. you should be able to have a B or a higher grade to stay in sports because that's the fair thing to do. Everyone is always so worried about sports that no one has any time to do there homework and finish class work, but then there are those people that can and do have time to do that, so that's why they get a B. I hope you can understand what I am trying to say.

I do agree with you and you should change it. For the people that play sports and have a C average they should start doing homework and more class work, so then can get it up to a B and then they can keep playing sports. thank you for reading my letter to you, and i hope you consider changing the school policy.

Thank you for everything!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
