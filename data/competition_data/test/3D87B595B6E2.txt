Schools should allow extracurricular activities and after school programs. It has been proven that most children show an increase in brain activity, creativity, and over all functionality when they have been and/or are currently doing an extracurricular activity. This includes sports such as football, basketball, baseball, soccer and many more outdoor activities that encourage physical health. These activities also include board games like scrabble, chess, and puzzles that help with brain growth, comprehension and critical thinking skills.

Extracurricular activities are always something someone should at least think about indulging one's self in. In any case an extracurricular activity could help you with a lot of obstacles in life; such as social struggles like making friends or speaking up in class or maybe less expressive things like focus and paying attention. These activities also help with confidence, self esteem and to a certain extent humility. Most extracurricular's teach teamwork and cooperation and in many cases how to make friends and conflict resolution. This usually resolves in great social and communication skills.

After school activities and extracurricular activities in addition don't just help with mental and/or physical health, but they also do a lot for one's future as well. An extracurricular activity in the future could be used as a credit for a job or college regime; even allow a person to earn a scholarship for the activity that they have chosen to participate and even excel in. Although most esteemed colleges do offer scholarships for physical sports, others often give scholarships for more academic extracurricular's such as debate, mathematics and common knowledge quizzers. This is a great reason to motivate one to take on an extracurricular and better one's self.

Extracurricular activities have become very important in the modern world. This because of the over usage of cellular devices, most people don't talk face to face or even go outside at all. It is important that people indulge in extracurricular activities so that they can create a face to face sense of understanding and friendship in an environment where everything is digital. The need for extracurricular activities is dire and has to comeback before the value of friendship is lost. Extracurricular activities maybe one of the most important things in this day and age.
