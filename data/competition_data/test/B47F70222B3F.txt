Why You Should Not Use Your Phone While Driving

Many drivers today are known for using their phones for locations, for example Lyft and Uber drivers need to use their phones In order to locate where the passengers are going and to also find them, but using your phone to make phone calls, texting, or using social media sites while in traffic Is very dangerous and unsafe for other individuals on the road. According to Pew Report about 59% of young adults are more likely to text and drive and more than a quarter of U.S. adults which Is 27% admit to texting while driving behind the wheel. These are dangers numbers which leads up to some of the reason why accidents happen.

According to Chicago Tribune there are more than 67,000 active Uber and Lyft drivers In the U.S

and all are know to use their phones to find the client or the destination In which the client Is going. This In my opinion Is a great use to use a phone while driving, not to be bias but their are other ways to phone that maybe more dangerous to others safe than that, like using your phone to be on social media, not only do you not have your phone In your hand but your not endangering the passengers (friends or family members) lives but If you have your phone In a phone holder, It ensure the safety of the passenger and also the safety of the other drivers, motorcyclist and pedestrians on the road.

Teens like myself are very active on social media because of the time and age that we live In, It's one in many ways to communicate with people. As I stated In the thesis statement about 59% of teenagers actively use their phones while driving. It Is dangerous for them because not only are some of them new to driving, but If It's their parent's car and they get Into an accident, insurance may not be able to pay for It.

In addition to this that other percentage Is adults which Is 27 percent that use their phones while driving even though they are older and are suppose to know better they still use their phones on the road endangering other pedestrians. These percentages are dangerous and are Increasing over the years which shows in the amount of accidents (According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually).

In conclusion driving while using your phone is bad and it is not beneficial to anyone else on the road. The safety of all drivers and pedestrians depends on what we do and when we do it. Even though i think its ok to use your phone if your are an uber driver or lyft driver i strongly disagree with the use of cellphones while it's in your hands.
