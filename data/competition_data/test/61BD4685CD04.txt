This technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is indeed valuable. I say this technology is valuable, because technology is only going to get more exposed and used more. But that's not always going to mean it's going to be accurate in the results that are shown. But for the most part I believe that this computer is going to be valuable in the times that it is being used in. It'll actually be helpful to many people if it was to be used.

This technololy is also another way for human to communicate through different communication barriers. This is a different way for people to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 maor muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of or more muscles is called an "action unit". Thus evidence from the passage provides and shows that this technoloy is vauable to many people.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. This evidence from the text provides that this technology can still be valuable and you can still enjoy it as well. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomign confused or bored, Dr Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This evidence shows how the technology actually works and is also accurate to many things that it says it's accurate to.

Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too. This information tells how the technology is valuable to not just emotional expressions, but also communication to. This technology is going to expand to many others so they can be ackowledged about it. So, they could actually get to use it if needed or wanted. So, it'll be there and provided if they decide to use it.

This concludes, that this technology is actually valuable. It provides a lot of factual evidence.

It has information that says that it is very valuable and so much more. It's very much so proven and provided. So, this technology is valuable for emotional expressions of students in a classroom and so much more than that.
