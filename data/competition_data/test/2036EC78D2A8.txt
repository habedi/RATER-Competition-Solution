I believe that the first policy is better as long as student do actually turn their phones off when they are prohibited to use them. If you give students time in their day to use they phones they will fell less tempted to use them during class which in turn will raise their grades because they will actually pay attention. Although even if the student is told to turn it off doesn't mean that they really will, many students get away with using their phones in class already. I truly believe that if you give them time to use their phone they will be less likely to use it when they are not allowed.

Students use many forms of concealment to hide their phones, whether they hide it in a binder, behind a book, or under their desk, students get away with using phones all the time! Some students use their phones excessively and get in trouble for it. If the first policy is put into play then there should be a consequence that makes sure students will actually turn their phones off.

some students already only use their phones when allowed but not many do.

If the second policy is put into play then students will fell "disconnected" with their friends and want to use their phones when not permitted causing more problems, time taken away from learning, and lower grades. This is why I fell that the first policy is better than the second. If the student is using their phone only when permitted, what is it going to hurt? I don't think that it will hurt anything at all, if not help with the war between students with their phones and teachers who take them away.

I think that the teachers will notice a difference in behavior immediately if students are allowed to use their phones during certain times. I can guarantee that some students will abuse the rule and get in trouble for it, but just because they will doesn't mean that everyone will. Many students will realize that they have a designated time to use their phones and put them away when they are supposed to, causing less problems and increased learning time.

If the students follow the rule about turning the phone off I think behavior in the school will be better which will get them in less trouble outside of school.
