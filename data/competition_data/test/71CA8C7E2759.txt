Hello my name is Ben I am a scientist at NASA, I have been discussing the face on mars with someone who believes it was created by aliens. I have read the Article "Unmasking the Face on Mars", and I have gathered some information and in my opinion I think the face was created by natural causes and is a natural landform. Here are some of my reasons.

My first reason why i think it is a natural land form is because as stated in paragraph three of "Unmasking the Face on Mars" "huge rock formatiom . . . which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'' By saying this they say that the face is meerly an angle with odd shadows making the illusion of a human face.

My second reason is in paragraph 5 which states "Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." By saying that the conspiracy theorists are completely controdicted and the NASA supporters are agreeing with them and saying yeah it would be good if there were actuallty life on mars and making it possative on their part.

My third reason is in Paragraph 7 which states that "Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time." The team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. And the photos revealed a natural land form, and there was no alien monument after all. This shows that at the time the lack of high-tech cameras and technology made the landform resemble a human face. But not everyone was satisfied.

Some may argue and say "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. But NASA went back and took another look at Cydonia on a "cloudless summer day" with their absolute maximum resolution camera and captured an extraordinary photo. But the photo contained no alien life forms as stated in paragraph 11 "So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"

In conclusion the face on mars is really just a natural landform, and stated in paragraph 12 "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West." "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho." said Garvin. Those are all of the reasons why i think the "Face on Mars" is actually just a natural landform.
