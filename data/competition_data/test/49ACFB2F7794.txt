Ok i am going with policy 1 because i would want to use my phone during free time. The way i think its fair because we ant going to text in class. And so that we can get in touch of our friends at lunch time so they can hang out and stuff like that.

When i got my Cell Phone i was texting in class. I know it is wrong but every body else was doing it to so i wanted to fit in. I got my phone taken away once by a teacher. I got caught because i wasn't looking around for the teacher and he was behind me the whole time and he was waiting for me two pop my head up so we can get it and the only words was "cut it off and give it to me."

Ok i go a question for you. If you was a principle will u let the kids at your school will u let them use there phone or not. Later.
