Venus the Hardest Planet to Explore

Venus is the hardest planet to explore because the ships only last a few hours on Venus,it has high tempertaures than Mercury even though Mercury is closer,and its weather conditions and atmosphere are bad compared to ours.

First, reason why Venus is hard to explore is because that the spacecrafts can only stay for a few hours. Since the planets have different orbitational speeds sometimes Earth and Venus are closer in some ways. So humans decided to send spacecrafts over to explore .There were a few previous missions that were unmanned. Not one spaceship has survived the landing. So for more than three decades there has not been one spaceship that has touched down on Venus for that specific reason.

Second reason is that Venus's temperatures are very high in scale. Even though Mercury is the closest to the sun Venus's temperatue is still higher. Venus's temperature can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit. which is 90 times greater than Earth's temperature. Even the deepst parts of Earth's ocean can liquefy any metals. So putting a submarine in the deepest parts of our ocean can damage the metals around it.

Finally thr third reason is that Venus's weather conditions and atmosphere are dangerously bad. On Venus there are many powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning stikes, and erupting volcanoes. The atmoshere contains 97% of carbon dioxide blankets. That being said humans wouldn't be able to live on Venus.

in conclusion Venus is the hardest planet to explore because the ships only last a few hours on Venus,it has high tempertaures than Mercury even though Mercury is closer,and its weather conditions and atmosphere are bad compared to ours.
