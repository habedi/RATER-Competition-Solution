This technology that can read students' emotional expression is good. Because it can read student's behavior. For example if a student is becoming confused or bored,then the teacher will know it, by looking in the technology. Then the teacher will help the student for her or his problem. Student can also use this technology for their family,friends and the people arround them,to know what their emotion or what they gonna do. For example if there's a man in your back and he's trying to hurt you,you can act quickly because the technology will tell you and you can run away from that man.

I support my claim by this evidence from the article in paragraph four,the facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes Dr. huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly).Using video imagery,the newemotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements.

Yeah, this technology will work really good for student. Also for teachers' and people who needed it. Becaus they can see what their friends expression or emotion if they gonna say somethin on them. If the technology tell you that your friends is sad you can tell them something to make them happy. This technology is really helpful for student and not just student,it can also help teacher and many people.
