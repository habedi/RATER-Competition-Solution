Dear principle, TEACHER_NAME

I believe helping our community is a big responsibility. We are giving a big part to help out. We should all be required to help out. Just like we have time to lay back watch tv we should have time to help others. Plus watching tv is not even helping us were just ruining our eye vision. We can pick up litter its simple as 1,2,3. Yeah okay were teens maybe some of us are embarrassed to do that. But there's other things we can do. We can sign up for programs, tutor, help out in a library, volunteer. Were not only helping others we helping ourselves too by getting recognized and on the other hand were not sitting in the couch all day long were even sometimes getting some physical done. Community service might take some time of your schedule but it isn't required to do 24/7, you can actually choose the day you would like to perform. This is a great opportunity to get to make friends too. Community service is a great benefit look at the positive side not just the negative. And if there is a negative I bet you, you can find a solution. Its time to take action.

Sincerely,
