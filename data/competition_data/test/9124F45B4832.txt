Dear principal,

I know you may be thinking that students should be required to perform community service. I believe that community service is a great way to help out the community, and is a very good way to teach people about the community and how to help the community.

With community service you are able to get a better reputation with you teachers, the people in your community, you athletic coaches and many other people, and having a good reputation is just like knowing the person as well as you know your family, but it is with someone you have just met.

Many people in the younger grades, like first grade through fourth grade, don't know what community service.

You are probably thinking why have the younger grades do community service, which i completely understand, they don't have to participate in the activities but they could at least be taught what it is and how they could help at such a young age.

The young years in there life is when they soak up the most knowledge and should be taught what is and how they can help out and work in the community.

Community service is a must in my book.

I also know that in most high schools it is required that you do a certain amount of hours every year, so what better time to start then when you are young and still learning.

As kids grow up to be teens and young adults they should have all of the knowledge that they need to participate in service activities. Whether it is working at a local school or local soup kitchen you should be able to pitch at least an hour of there time into helping other people out.

I know this is your decision but if you would just put this letter in to consideration i would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for taking time into reading my letter.

I really appreciate your time.
