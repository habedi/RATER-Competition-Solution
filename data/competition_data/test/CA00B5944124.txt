The aurthor suggested studying Venus is worthy but it does come with a lot of dangerous things. The author knows that venus isn't really the safest to be in and knows the danger it has but it's also the closest planet to earth. They call Venus and earth twins becuase they have same density, size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its prximity to us". People in NASA take a lot of time and a lot of risks in outer space but it also helps learn and understand the Earth and some parts outer space.

"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans". NASA is still studying Venus, have some simplified electronics and are being tested." Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades".

They create new things to help us travel and explore to get their safe. Earth is very different to the other planets of course so that's why we need the right materials to do the experiment and the right people. NASA needs people that are highly trained and went to school to study and knows everyhting. Also someone who has been working in simliar type of things so like experience so we can continuing studing Venus. Venus is worthy to study for ,the author says dispite the dangers becasue everyone knows theirs going to be dangerous things but it's worth to keep studying for and learning and putting technology on Venus.
