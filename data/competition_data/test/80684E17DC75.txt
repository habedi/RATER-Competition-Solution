During the school year students dream about the summer ,but neglect the summer project that is assigned. For many years, teachers have assigned a summer project for students to do. Most students completely forget about the project. They don't have motivation to start or finish the project because it's not in their interest. Some believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed.

A reason why projects should be student oriented is that students become more expressive in their summer project. Students become more creative when projects feel less like a chore. I could program a game or website over the summer to show my creativity. As well this allows the student to think outside of the box. Another reason is students will be more diverse in their project. No one will have the same project. This allows the teacher to go in depth with grading to give a more accurate grade. Many peers can learn something new from each others project rather than all learning the same thing. I would make a project to why the military is very beneficial. However, one student might think civilian life is better. We could discuss to each other our views. Furthermore, students will have more motive to complete their project. I always put aside the summer school project. It's never fun to do work that doesn't interest you. This allows for the percentage of students completing their project to rise.

Student designed projects allows students to find new interests. Doing a project on something you learned already makes it feel repetitive. I personally wasn't all about NJROTC until I started to come to practice more ,and this opened a new array of options for me after high school. This allows the students to be more geared to learn new things such as: building a computer, time management during the school year, and budgeting. Additionally, another reason why projects should be student oriented is cheating will decrease among projects. If the teacher assigns the same projects people can easily cheat off each other. During the summer, I have been asked multiple times from friends if they could copy off my project. If I were to do my own project they couldn't copy off of me. Students can learn more information from doing the project themselves. This also shows the skill level of students. Finally, students have more freedom to do their project. This allows them to express their ideas. I love to have freedom it allows me to have a sense of free will. This allows most to make the project to feel a lot less like a project ,and more of a fun activity to do.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed. The reason I believe this is expressing yourself, diversity, more motive to complete the project, finding new interests, cheating will decrease, and more freedom. Although, some believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Ultimately, students should have the right to choose what they want to do in their project since it's their project.
