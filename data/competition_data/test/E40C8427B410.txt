the policy that i think is better is allowing students to bring cell phones to school and using them while their at lunch. this policy will be helpful to other students because it will help them stay in touch with there family members. if a student is absent the person could text the student during lunch time and tell him the homework. the students could tell their mom or dad to bring their homework for the next class that they have. my first reason is that the kids could text their mom or dad if they needed their books. another reason is that the kids could organize their notes in their cells. the last reason would be that the students could warn their classmates that they have a test and they need to study for it.

my first reason would be that the students could text their mom or dad if they needed books for the next class. if the students forget their homework in class they could just text their mom or dad and tell them to bring it instead of getting a zero in class.
