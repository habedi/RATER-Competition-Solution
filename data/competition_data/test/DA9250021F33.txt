Dear Principal,

I think that policy number one should be the policy for out school. If you do not allow students at school to have their cell phones that probably wouldn't be that good for the teachers and the students. Lets say that you have an emergency at school and the kid doesn't have his cell phone to call his mom or dad. He would be in a bad situation and the no cell phone policy would come back to haunt you. I think that policy one is great. If teachers catch the students using their cell phone then their should be a punishment after a certain amount of times being caught. I think that it would be fair if they could use them during lunch periods and stuff like that. If they are turned off during class, they shouldn't be a distraction to their learning.

I am not saying that policy two is not a good idea but students wouldn't be themselves if they didn't have their cell phones. Their could be some good things that come out of not having cell phones at all. If you didn't have cell phones at all during school then the teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids texting and could focus on teaching the class. Also, you might see some grades improve if you take away cell phones. Now their are probably some negative things about kids not having cell phones. If a kid has an after school activity and he doesn't have anything to contact his parents then you might have a problem. Some students might argue that if they can not have cell phones them teachers wouldn't be aloud to either.

I think that policy one would be the way to go if I was you Principal. With that students would be able to contact their parents if they had an after school activity. Maybe something bad happened to one of their family members and they wanted to be notified, with their cell phone they would be.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
