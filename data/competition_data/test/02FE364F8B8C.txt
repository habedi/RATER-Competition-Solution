I think that the use of this technology in a classroom would be very hepful. In the article the author suggests that it would be helpful to a class. The computer could see what the teacher can not.

In the article the author said that the technology could see if a student is confused. Sometimes if a student is confused they are to afraid to say anything. As a student, I know from experience that kids can be really shy when it comes to asking a teacher a question. With this technology teachers would know if a student is confused and can talk to them without everyone else making them so nervous about it.

A teacher can also help if the computer saw that something was upseting someone. Maybe this technology could help with the bullying that happens in schools by showing that a student is upset or depressed. The teachers or cousiler can talk to the student about whats upseting them.

So yes, I think that this technolgy would be valuable in a classroom. I think that the technology could help with a lot of problems in schools. It would be helpful in a lot of places and with a lot of problems.
