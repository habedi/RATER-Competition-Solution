Every four years, the United States is turned into a political battleground by the campaign for presidency.  The electoral College, the voting method used since the nation began, Is being highly questioned on its efficiency now vs the efficiency 250 years ago. However, the system has survived because it works.  Despite its flaws, the Electoral College does a good job of simplifying the presidential election and eliminating disputes or a potential crisis.  It produces a clear winner, it makes sure that the president is popular in all areas of the country, and it puts the weight of the campaign on the swing states.

In most presidentai races, the president wins only by a small margin.  rarely is there a landslide  victory or a complete vote for a president.  This small majority can lead to many disputes over the credibility of counting the votes in the individual states.  This is why the Electoral College helps the voting process.  The Electoral College helps the voting process because it produces a more clear winner.  For example, in line 21 it claims that "In [2012's] election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote sompared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney".  This shows that while the popluar vote can be extremely tight, the winner gaining sometimes less than 1 percent of the popluar votes, the Electoral College helps the system by giving the winner a landslide advantage and therefore clearing up any claims over the credibility of the popular votes which the loser can produce.  Also, the Electoral College helps prevent the situation of no president winning the majority of the votes.  the introduction of third parties can sometimes mean that no party gains more than half of the votes.  However, the Electoral College helps deal with that situation.  In 1968 and 1992, Nixon and Clinton both had less than the majority, but won because they had the Electoral College in their favor.  This is why the Electoral College still works today.

There are some areas of the nation that are very highly populated.  The southern and western regions of the nation are becoming more and more populated, and the northern regions are diminishing in size.  By popular vote, a president who wins the southern regions alone would have a good chance of winning the nation.  However, that system does not work under the electoral college vote. The Electoral College is a good system for voting on the president because it requires a president to be popular across the nation.  Under the Electoral College, a president can not suffice by winning the votes in a couple of states.  They must get points from states across the nation and then will it add up to a victory.  This is good because a president with only a regional majority will mainly focus on the region which he is based on.  The other regions will be disregarded, and not paid as much attention to.  The Electoral College prevents this outcome.  This is another reason why the Electoral College is a good method of picking the presidency.

Most states will have a tendency to almost always vote for a patricular party.  The real difference in Electoral votes lies mostly in the states who will vote either way, or 'Swing States".  The Electoral College is a good thing because it puts the emphasis on the states who will vote either way, ensuring the credibility of the candidate.  These swing states know that they are the ones who decide the election.  Therefore, it is the voters in these states who pay more attention to the campaign, who research the candidates more, and who listen to what the candidates have to say.  This is a bonus for the Electoral College because it means that the candidate who will be elected is the candidate who will do best for the country, not necessarily the most popular.  Because of this, the Electoral College should remain the system of voting on the presidency.

There are arguments that the Electoral College should be abolished.  That the system of sending electors to congress to vote for them does not work because they can't guarantee that the electors will vote for who they are supposed to do.  However, the chances of that happening today and the elector getting away with it are very slim.  Today,  The people and the government know exactly how much votes each state gave to each candidate, and they know exactly how much electoral votes a candidate should get.  So even if you manage to add a vote to your candidate,  It's very likely that someone will do the math and figure out that something's not right with the votes.

Like every system, the Electoral College has its flaws.  However, the system is the best we can put in place to elect a new president.  The system still is used after 250 years because it easily simplifies the disputes that can easily occur over the tight popular vote margins.  So the next time you vote for the president, You'll know that you are voting in the most efficient democratic system to date.
