Dear Principal,

I honestly think that you should consider having policy #1. Students would love to have their cell phones with them during school hours. They should be able to use them during snack, lunch, before school, and after school. However, you should make a strict policy about using cell phones during class time. students should not be allowed to use their cell phones during class for these reasons: they wouldn't pay attention to the teacher anymore which would make their grades drop, they would keep texting and they wouldn't be focused on the lesson at all, and if everybody's grades start dropping the next generation would not have money at all. However, there is nothing wrong with them having their cell phone with them during snack and lunch. Some people don't have friends and at snack and lunch they sit alone and do not know what to do. if you give students a chance to have their cell phones with them during snack and lunch they at least have their cell phone with them and play games on it or listen to music. Students would also be able to communicate with their parents if they need something. For example if someone forgot their book at home but really needs it for the next class; they would call their mom or dad during snack or the five minute passing time and they would bring it to school. But if you don't have your cell phone with you then you would get an F for just forgetting something at home. If you let them have their cell phones and they cross the line like using it in class and getting in trouble too much because of it, remember, you can always go back to having no cell phones in school; but I think that you should try it and see what happens.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
