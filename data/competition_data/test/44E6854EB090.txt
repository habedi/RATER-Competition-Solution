There are ten colorful balls flying in the air, juggled by the clown in the circus. The lights are streaming through the tent cracks, and the energy is electrifying as he attepts more risky stunts. However, what would happen when someone throws him another ball? Not prepared for this sudden change, he loses his coordination and lands on the ground in a helpless heap. This is a great analogy for someone who does not have enough time in their day. Some principals have decided to force students to participate in at least one after school activity. Schools should not make extracurricular activities mandatory because it will be overextending students, limiting freedoms and compromising relationships, and be met with grudging and unwilling levels of participation.

After all, students already dedicate so much of their time to school. On average, an American student will spend around 6-7 in school, a sizable portion of his or her day. Their days will be filled with projects, assignments, quizzes, and tests, all of which is placing unprecedented amounts of pressure to succeed. Especially with the educational landscape changing so dramatically, how can we continue to expect so much from these children when we are constantly adding expectations? Many students already feel as if they don't have enough time to participate in their hobbies and activities outside of school. Additionally, school pressure has been heavily contributing to a decline in mental health, both mild and severe. While school can be fun and exciting, there is no denying the negative impact it may have have socially, emotionally, mentally, and physically. Many choose to go home to relax, rewind, and recharge for the next day. Stealing away their time may lead to a decline in school performance and a toxic environment. This rule is also not taking into consideration families who rely on their children's income to provide for their needs. The ramifications of this rule are very much overlooked, and this can be threatening those who simply do not have the time to stay longer in school.

Nevertheless, students may still choose to stay after school. Students often join extracurricular activities to explore their strengths and interests with like-minded individuals in a safe environment. Making this mandatory would take away from the general experience of those who choose to be there while corrupting the safe space that has been built over time. Not having any personal time nor having the choice of what to spend it on would effectively lessen dedication students would put into their education. Not only that, it would weaken connections with those outside of school. It has been shown that connections between people are built over time, so the lack of personal time to spend with friends and family would negatively impact relationships.

Let's take a walk, shall we? The day is crisp and bright, and the sun is gleaming through dew on the trees. The leaves underneath your feet crunch as you stroll merrily through your backyard. Suddenly, a shrill voice cuts through your haze. Your mother is telling you to take out the trash, fold the laundry, feed the dog, and eat dinner before you leave for softball in thirty minutes. You shuffle your feet back inside, your mod darkened by the looming tasks ahead. Traditionally, it has been shown that we tend to not enjoy activities as much when they are being forced upon us. Let's take chores. While helping out around the house can be rewarding, few people would consider it an enjoyable activity. That is because the levels of enjoyment and reward caused by the chemical dopamine go down when we are being forced to by an authority figure. Humans are hardwired towards freedom, and therefore do not want to be told what to do. Making after school activities mandatory may increase levels of participation, but it will not have been as meaningful or enjoyable for the students in question.

In summary, the hypothetical positives of instituting this new rule do not overshadow the real effects this would have on students lives. Many people already wish we could add three hours to the day to have space for everything we have to get done. We should not be adding to a students already heavy burden by making extracurricular activities mandatory. They have enough problems juggling ten balls; let's not throw them another.
