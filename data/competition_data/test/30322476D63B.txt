Cell Phone usage in cars

Do you ever catch yourself being on your phone more than you should be while driving down the road? In today's world we have had to put a lot of laws and regulations in place just to keep people safe. For example Georgia's hands-free law took effect July 1, 2018 with all new rules and regulations about cell phones being used while driving.

In my opinion parts of the law makes things safer but then some of it is a little too much. One thing that I agree with is that "Even with hands-free technology, drivers cannot write, read, or send text messages, emails, social media content and other internet data while on the road." I feel very strongly about this one due to there being so many people who have accidents while trying to send texts or look at the latest posts while at a traffic stop. Some parts are a little too much though, starting with "Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while driving. "It would be crazy to get a ticket just for your phone touching you.

Phone usage in vehicles has its pros and cons. I think it's great to have a cell phone with you at all times any time you get in a vehicle to drive in case of an emergency. Also Cell phone usage usually causes emergencies. I believe drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle, but only hands free. Also they need to make the vehicles more acquitted to ensure cell phones can only do certain things in it.

For example care could not allow any texts to be sent or received. You also shouldn't be able to make hands free cells when going certain speeds. I also think they should bult in systems for teenage drivers where it sends notifications to the parents when they go over the speed limit, break hard or drive without a seat belt.

In conclusion I feel that cell phone usage in vehicles should be allowed. They create a lot of accidents but they also save lives by calling for help. Cell phones are a lot of people's lifelines. And should be allowed usage in cars!
