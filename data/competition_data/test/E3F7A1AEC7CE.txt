The technology to read emotional expressions of students would be valuable because it could help consulors with their jobs. The reason why is because the computer can read emotiaonal expressions of students so the consulors can use the techology to thier advange. As the text says Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and also 6 percent fearful. Imagine having a consulor having that type of tech in their hands. Their would be less fights less sucdial tenions and aslo less bullying.

The technology could also make alot of students smile. As the text states you can conduct an experiment by going to the bathroom and raise your lips at the conroners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slighty to produce wrinkling at the croners of your eyes. And also by holding that raise the outers parts of your cheek up towrad your eyes. They say doing all those faces and experiments can make a person happy just by trying it. Also putting a happy face on your face could infunces others to try the same thing and get the same resluts.

Also if a techaer wanted to prove that the emotional expression technology is vaulable they could set up a way to let the students use and play with the tech. That would let student exprence and see how the technology works and function so that in the future they would know how to use it to. This information can also take technology and others courses to a different level. The reason why is becuase if students learn how to take contorl of this technology they can try to forge it into their own work of art and make it better than before. as the text says your home PC cant handle the complex alogrithms used to decode mona lisa's smile but we can write down simple instructions that encode different emotions. That states there to me that if students get thier hands this type of tech they could alter the world solve problems in a insict or a heart beat and even help bring bullying to a end. Students may think letting the system read their emations is a bad thing or might them feel uncomfortbale but it shouldn't. It's to help them and the teacher have a better relationship and aslo solve problems faster.
