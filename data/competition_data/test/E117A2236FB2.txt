Dear Principle,

I hear that you are planing on changing the schools cell phone policy. I applaud you for that. I completely agree with you that our school has been having trouble with the whole cell phone thing.

I have been thinking about your two possibilities and thought I would assist you with the truthful thought of a student. Although policy two assures that no student will be tempted to text during class, I believe that policy one is the right way to go because of the fact that kids forget things and need to set reminders like you can do on a phone, also you can text your family if you forgot something and need them to bring it to you. These are some of the reasons why i believe that policy one is the better way to go.

First off, students should be allowed to have their phones at school because now a days cell phones are becoming the only way for kids to be in touch with family and friends. If students need to get a hold of their direct family they need to have their phones. If you were to go with policy two students would have no way of doing that. Trust me when i say that students should be allowed to have their phones during school hours incase of an emergency.

Then there is the fact that if student have them during lunch and other free times they will be more likely to follow the rules of turning them off during class so they don't get in trouble and wont have the privilege of being able to use them taken away as well. I know that if you were to change the policy to number two I would follow those rules very carefully. Students would enjoy following the rule if that meant that we could use them during lunch and other free times.

Lastly there is the reason of how students would be more on task. They would have already talked to their friends during free times that they would have nothing more to say and would be able to focus more on the school work. If we are more focused then we are less likely to annoy the teachers with our chatty-ness and we would be able to get further on in the curriculum then we do now.

This would be better the school and for the students.

All in all, student should be allowed to have our phones with us at school. We would be able to talk to family and friends when we needed to during free times, we would follow the rules more so that we wouldn't lose our privilege of using the phones during school hours, lastly we would not be as talkative and would be able to focus more because we would have already gotten to say what was needed to be said. So please consider what I have provided in my letter to you about why i believe policy two is the better way to go. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,
