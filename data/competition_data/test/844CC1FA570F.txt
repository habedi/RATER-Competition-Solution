Well I thought that it is good idea but also that a lot of kids have a thing were they are worried about staying on the team and they don't really have the skills to do there work.

but also what the principal should realize is that they should keep it at a C grade average because a lot of schools want a good sports programs at there school because a lot of parents that are enrolling may want to look at sports for there kid . But what some people should realize is that kids think of things differently than adults.

kids such as my self want to get good grades but they have trouble asking for help so that affects with there grades and they cant play sports .

As a reason for changing the grade policy they should change the grading systems because the way some teachers grade it is if the student has a good grade and the teacher deducts from there grade because of there behavior.

Another good pointer is that students and teachers have a unique way of acting around each other so if you ask a teacher for a recommendation and you act bad and you may need a good recommendation and they give you a bad rep. For what you need and you have a good grades and you might want to play football you cant cause you behavior you issues have gotten in your way then you might not get what you need . I guess all i' m trying to say is that you should not because a lot of things may not go a way people want it to go.
