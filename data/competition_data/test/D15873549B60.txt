Sports, working on a year book, and serve on the student council are great extracurricular activities. I don't agree with all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some students have to take care of their younger brothers and sisters because kids don't know how to take of themselves. For example, you leave a kid alone for one day he/she will cry, pout, and scream because he/she are scared, alone, and frighten. Kids are still young and clueless. Some students also may have already participated in other activities outside of school, like hockey, football, and many more. I do not think they would want to participate in a school activity because it's a waste their of time and they are already doing an activity outside of school. Students also need to get some rest and sleep not doing an school activity almost everyday. For example, I would hate doing an school activity almost everyday because most of the time I'm lazy and all I want to do is relax and sleep. These days students are lazy and addicted to social media because life is boring and barley fun. Students have other problems to work out at home, like family problems, personal problems, and sickness problems. Some of them would probably not attend school activities or school. Students should not particapte at least one extracurriclar activity. It is up to he/she choice if he/she wants too or not nobody should be forced to participate in an school activity.
