Car emmitons have been a real problem since the automobile indrustry has gone up. During the year of 2005 car use in the united states was at an all time high. There are a plethora of problems with how much and how often people use their cars for example, with the use of all those cars the air pollution levels in dencly populated areas are dangerously high due to all of the cars that are present,the air pollution is causing acid rain than can be very harmful to people and even stripping paint from cars at times,car acciedents due to the large number of cars killing thousands of people each year, and most of all the enviornment causing some some habitats of animals to now be unlivible for some animals. Some of these problems coulb be solved if the community starts to limit car usage and starts to do what they are told.

Are pollution has started to become a giant problem among the entire world causing people to inhale fumes from cars unintentinally and after a while can cause many problems to your body such as cancer, teberculosis and among many others complications that can occur. Air pollution can also cuase places that are very nice start looking a bit gloomy because of all of the bad cloud cover

Acid rain can cause massive destruction on a mass scale depending on the level of polluton in the rain. Right now its not as high but as more and more cars are being produced and driven more and more pollution is being emmited from the cars that are driven. if we as a community helpÂ  limmit the use of cars we can help the ammount of acid in the rain go down and therefor helping out the earth not just our community.
