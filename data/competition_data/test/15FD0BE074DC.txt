Was the Face on Mars created by aliens?

Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens? I don't... and that's because it's to many reasons that prove it's not. I'm a scientist at NASA and I helped prove these reasons. We found that it is just a butte or a mesa, aliens are not even real, and there is no life on Mars.

It has been proven that it is just a butte or a mesa, this is what the picture actually shows....landforms. A friend my mine, Garvin says that is reminds him of "Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho" that's here on Earth. So that states that we have the resources to prove it is a mesa!

It has been proven aliens are not even real. I mean people "say" they have seen one and even took pictures of them, but that doesn't mean they are real. We have not yet seen or even captured one for testing yet which proves that they are not real. This person who tells me that they "think" aliens created this face doen't even know if it's true. Therefore this is just a thought that is not true.

On another note there is no life on Mars, as proven by us (NASA). We have tested for air and a way we could live there without holding a oxegen tank around and there is no way. People think we are hiding if there is any life on Mars and if the face was created by aliens, but why would we let the World know that we were even researching about life on Mars or that we even found a face on Mars if we didn't want the World to know? Yes, we've done research over and over again to prove to the World that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a mesa, so we ask that the World believes us and keep the peace.

I have given my reasons why aliens did not create this face on Mars, and you may or may not agree, just please I ask you to keep the peace.
