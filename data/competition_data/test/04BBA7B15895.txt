I think in the years to come that maybe, just maybe something like this could work, but it wont be anytime soon. First off this will obviously be overwehlmingly expensive and will be very time cosumming. Right now people should not be thinking about these expensive plans because roadways today are still atleast somewhat reliable. considering this will require many years of work, and ruin the routes for people making it unconvenient for some that have daily routines to get around to sum up their day.

The biggest problem that I see is money and how much something like this could very well cripple our economy, obviously the other problems are serious like getting the amount of people necessary to do something this bold. Dont get me wrong it can solve the shortage of jobs and could get people off the streets and give chances to those less fortunate and could also pay extremely well. At the same time aswell, what happens to the workers after they are done with the roads. They could possibly end up without more jobs after the fact and the prices in the economy in my mind will have shot up.

I also think its a bad idea because of where the money might be coming from. My biggest opinion is that it will possibly be coming out of the tax payers and this will bring a domino effect of poverty because the jobs people work for might not be able to keep up with the amount of money coming out of their employees checks. This could for sure bring a huge downfall in America's economy.

Time in my opinion will also not be on anybody side because it would be reguired for all streets, backroads, interstate highways, and country roads internationally to be remanufactured. Maybe even surrounding countries like Canada and Mexico might have to adapt to the big change in roads. This would also trickle down all the way into south america and maybe be impossible for some places to obtain the funds or resources to make these things happen.

These reasons in my opinion are very clear and understanable to most because of the situations countries go through on a daily baises. Money, time, materials, and man power are required for this huge plan and I dont think it will be provided anytime soon. This is something that really seems impossible, but nobody will never know exactly what the future holds for our roadways.
