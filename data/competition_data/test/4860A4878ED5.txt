Dear principal,

I believe students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch or other free times.

Many students seem to abuse their privileges.

If this were to happen then I'd advise you to not allow them to bring it to school at all. I have many reasons why I believe this. Allow me to explain.

For starters, I do believe that there is an issue with students having their phones on during class. Giving them an opportunity to use them during lunch or free breaks will take away the urge to use them in class.

Most students aren't able to see their friends during the school day, so allowing them to text their friends at lunch would give them time to catch up.

In addition to using them during lunch we have to make sure that they are turned off in class. If they are on in class students can easily share answers for a test.

I would suggest that if a student is caught with their phones on in class the first time that it should be taken to the front office and not given back until a parent/ guardian comes to get it.

If you see them with it for a second time they should get ISS.

If they are caught with their phone in class a third time then they should definitely be suspended.

In conclusion, I believe that students should be allowed to have their phones on at school during lunch time and extra free breaks. It allows the students to catch up with their friends that they don't get to see during the day.

If they are caught with their phones in class then disciplinary actions should be taken.

Sincerely,
