community work

I have noticed that some of the streets and ground is full of trash. Trash bags, litter, paper, water bottles, plastic, and other stuff. We should stop the littering and everyone should pitch into clean up our earth so creatures like birds, dear, fish, and other animals can flourish. Also if we keep our community clean it will look allot nicer then people would live in the area just because its clean. So i suggest that everyone in the schools fourth grade and up can go to an after school program to help our community. days like Mondays and Tuesdays would be good, or whenever some one sees trash.

If every school every person cleans up every community, then i promise we will live in a much beautiful place to call home. Here is some tips on how to keep our community's clean, have a large trash bin on every curve of every house, have trash bins in a park, if you see some trash laying around then pick it up and put it in the trash, if you cant find a trash bin then hold it until you find one. Follow these steps to clean the community clean.

Think about this, if every kid in every school cleans up the environment, and if there's 500 kids in each school then that's a whole lot of people helping the community. Imagine all these kids out helping to clean the environment, the streets, parks, community's free of all garbage, wouldn't that be awesome! Not only the schools but if we inspire other people like in churches, think of some of the youth groups that can help to. OTHER_NAME already has something like community work.

If every person picks up garbage and follows these rules 1 at a time then trust me, our homes parks nature everything would be allot more pleasant. And it would be amazing if all the people helped to keep community's clean. Wouldn't you agree more?
