So this is what i think about why you should help the seagoing cowboys. Also why you should sign up.

I think you should join them because they helped people that lost everything from World War II. They would sail to Europe in cattle boats so they could give cattle, and meat to everyone that was devastated by the war. They also got to see alot. You got to sail past alot of places so you could see the great wall of china and all those tuorist attractions. They also got to help people like charity or like helping at a senior home if you are in to that stuff then you should sign up.

In the story it menchaned how they got to see so many diffrent countries. So you would have alot of fun. You could see many tourist attractions like the Great Wall Of China, and thats onlly one think of all the others. You also got to play games on the boat so you wernt always board. There was alot you could do. You also had alot of freedom.

Last but not least the goodness about it. This job would put happieness in your heart because when you bring the cattle, and food you are helping the homeless and the poor. Those people that got everything tooken away your there refuge and to me that would make me happy. So being kind putting other in front of you so they are happy is a good deed.

I think thats why you shoudl join so you can help the people that need saving, and also you get to see stuff you might never get to see again.
