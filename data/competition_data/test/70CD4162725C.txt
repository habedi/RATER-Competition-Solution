Dear Principal,

I do think it's fair to let only B average students play sports or other fun activities because have they do their work and focus a lot in school. If you let some with an F average play, it won't be fair to let him play than someone with an A average. F average students don't really care about school or doing their work, because of sports and activities; they focus too much on other things than school. On the other hand, students with a good GPA focus on school and on what they have to do. Most coaches i know would much rather prefer someone that's an average player but gets good grades, than the best player who has low grades. If you don't have good grades, it won't get you anywhere in life, except maybe working at a fast food restaurant making minimum wedge.

One thing i do disagree on with you is the B average. I'd think at least a C average student is worthy of playing or doing fun activities. I know they may not be the smartest people but they might have potential to start doing better in school. If I was the coach, I'd keep that C average kid on check with his grades, and as soon as they start dropping, I'm going to kick them off the team.

I myself might be around like a C average student and will do better in school. My dad won't even tolerate a C- because he says it's pretty much a D. Both my parents have me on check and as soon as they hear that I was misbehaving, or not doing my work, that's it, no more sports, games or privileges to out with my friends until I pick up my grades.

But, all I'm asking for is to let at least a C average student play sports or activities in school, they might be perfect A+ students, but most try hard to do their work, and deserve a chance to participate in extra-curricular activities.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
