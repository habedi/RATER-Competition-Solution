Being active in school can be fun and educational, yet boring or unfair to the people who doesn't find extracurricular activities amusing. The fact that the principal says that every student should participate sounds a little pushy. I am against the principal's decision on the students taking extracurricular activities because of the following reasons.

For example, not all students like sports, yearbooks, or student council. There are other varieties out there that students like such as; books, art, drama, music, culinary, and much more. The principal's decision isn't accurate for every student to participate in an extracurricular activity. Forcing every student to take one when they don't want to, is going to make them start skipping or not be interested in the class. They need to take a class that they're interested in. If they like music, they can join; band, orchestra, or chorus, if they like chess or drama, they can take a club for it. There can be a book club, chess club, drama club, or art club for the students that are interested or good at those things.

Yet, having every student participate in an extra class can cause problems. Fights, financial, or overcrowding. In fact, the students schedule might be book and having them take an extra class they don't need can be stressful, even to the teachers that have to keep up with all their classes. Plus, it depends on if it's an after schoolÂ activity or an activity during school hours because students do have a life outside of school that can be very important. For example, if the student is an athlete, then they would have to reschedule everything on that day or week, or if they have culinary class and have to bake a cake by next week, then they're going to have to cut everything short just to bake a cake in time. You don't want any student coming to school the next day stressful and tired.

Therefore, making every student take an extra class doesn't make everyone happy. However, it is a good idea to participate, but there's always a catch. For example, taking a culinary class can teach you how ti cook, but you also have; soccer practice, band, student government, and chess club on the same day. It's already stressful enough that you have those 4 classes on the same day and to add an extra one that you don't need can cause you to be endlessly tired all the time. That's the catch. Being stressful and tired. And no, I mean no student should be going through that at a young age just because their pushy principal wants them to take an extra class.

The principal's decision wasn't so bright. He didn't think fully through the pros and cons. Yes, extracurricular activities are helpful and educational, but not everyone agrees with it. It's stressful and problematic to the students and teachers. They really don't need to take another class, it really just depends on who it is and what they like to make them take an extra class. Not everyone can multitask.
