I think you should be able to join special sport for school when you have a low grade. When you get in sport it might help you get your grade go up because it get you to get positive and bring your grade up. When you try out you might think that you should bring up your grade for in the future you can get into that same sport. When you can bring your grade up you say i want to try out but there is no more sport you can try out for that you like. Your parent get you to bring your grade up and you get to get your fitness up and have the same point as your grade in school.

You might think that your not smart from the outside but from the inside you are very smart. You can plan your plans from the inside and get smarter like that and it will help you too in school. When you have a low grade you are saying in your mind i cant try out for that sport you like. Teenagers want to play that sport but they cant because of there grade and they get sad. You can bring your grade up by asking your coach or teacher to help you with your homework or your skills.

When you can get better and better at that sport you can be doing that same thing in your grades. As you get good at your grades your coaches will let you join more clubs and will get your maybe to be famous. I will tell my friends that are in sports to get out and make a protest for the grade that you need to be in sports. The grade that you need to be in sport is good but some cant get that grade and like to play in sports. The grade that you need is good for kids but some of then don't like to play in sports.

Your parents want you to be in sports but they want you to be good in school too. As your school progress you have to be good to pass your classes but you want to be good in sports too. Your sports skills is good too and your class grade is bad but as you get honored you can bring your grades up.
