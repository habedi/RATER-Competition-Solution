Why Policy One is not only a good choice, but also a right a choice.

Cell phones, in today's world it is hard to live without one. They do everything, from updating a facebook status to texting a friend, to calling 911 in an emergency. every day now you see thousands of cell phones glued to the hands of kids. Is it wrong to give such a young person such a powerful device? this has really been the question on the minds of thousands of people and is now on the mind of one that has the power to finally answer this question. Our principal is in a self debate on whether or not to allow cell phones in the school for good. Two policies have been brought to his attention the first will allow the use of cell phones at lunch and other free periods. The second will annul the use of any cellular device on school grounds. You probably know the answer many students will give but probably not the principle's, read my article and let me walk Policy One through the with and show you my idea on the topic at hand.

Policy One clearly states that cell phones may be used during lunch and free time but must be turned off during class. This to me sounds like a great compromise students get to use their "ever so precious devices" as long as they are not in class, which makes perfect sense because they are obviously not doing any thing important or of great value so we can just let them text away. Now here comes the stinger if you bring you cell phone in and your are caught in class expect a cardinal punishment to be brought onto you. Naturally the principal knows that some students will just not obey the rules and punishments will be handed out to them. This is what I think is the principal's major pushing point to take Policy Two. If she comes to the simple mindset that she is doing something nice for you but you don't do anything nice back in return then what is the point in having the Policy One. That is the sad truth, if you let one dog out all of them want to come out.

Let me tell you this if she decides to go with the second policy much more students will get in trouble. These are the students that only take out their phones during free times but now because phones are banned for good they receive the full wrath of the law .

Truthfully the principal has to understand that if a student has a phone their is a 99% chance of him/her bringing to school, no matter what the rules are and no matter what type of punishment they will receive. That phone is a part of them and they will do anything to protect it.
