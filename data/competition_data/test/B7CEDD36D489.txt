some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home or from video conferencing. I think learning from home can be very helpful to some students especially if students have a hard time being at school or struggle in certain things. Working from home could also be a lot less stressful and students could actually have more times to get things done.

benefits from working from home is students won't be to distracted because they won't have others bothering them while they get there work done. It could help some kids because a lot struggle with anxiety and it becomes a little bit harder for some students when they have to talk in front of the class, taking a test, or when a teacher calls on them when there hand wasn't raised. Also students working from home won't have to worry about certain kids bullying them or making fun of what there wearing or how they look.

Although working from home can also have some cons. Students won't get to interact with other students, won't have the opportunity to do school activities, and might have trouble finding friends or a place to fit in. Students working from home won't get to experience certain things that go on in the class room. Teachers could making students do a fun learning activity even in science students get to do lab experiments. Also some classes will even go on field trips to certain places. A lot of things go on in school and a lot of those things you can't do from home so you may feel a little left out.

i wonder if students are still a loud to play in a school sport or if they get to attend the school dances like homecoming and prom. If a student has a choice to work from home do they have to pay for books that they might need or will the school offer them for free. Kids that go to school have to get up at a specific time so does that mean kids that stay home school get to sleep in or gt up at a specific time. some kids might want this option but also there parents work and might not won't there kid home alone all day.

However, having class at home i think is a great idea and definitely should be and option especially if kids dont really like school. Having school at home might have some pros and cons but its also a big choice to make and maybe something to consider and if you are worried about sending your kid to school. You always wanna make sure what things are best for your kid and if these things will help in the future to make you and them happy.
