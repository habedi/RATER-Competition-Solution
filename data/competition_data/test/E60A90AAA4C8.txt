The Face on Mars is really just a big mistunderstanding. I strongly say that because there so many reasons what this could be. The text says only a few scientists thinks the Face is an alien artifact, I could see if there was atleast half but theres only few. There is nothing really that proves that its an alien artifact, therefore I would say believe that its just a natrual landform.

In the text it says that when they took the picture it was winter. That means its a cloudy time for Mars. So the clouds could b messing it up and making it appear as a face. Even on Earth if we look at a cloud it can make the shape of a face or anything. The article also states that the Face on Mars is about the same height of a lava dome. Which means this could be a lava dome mixed with a cloud and that cause it to look like a face.

So we would never know intil someone physically go and see it for themself. So I strongly believe that this is just a big mistunderstanding.
