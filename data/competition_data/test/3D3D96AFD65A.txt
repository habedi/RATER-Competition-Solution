I'm opposing the idea for driverless cars because, although it's a good thought, I wouldn't feel safe driving on a road where there is a car without a person. I was intrigued by the question in paragraph 9 when it asked, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fauly - the driver or the maufacturer?" I think the maufacturer is to blame because they're the people putting these cars on the street although people are buying them and giving their lives to a computer I just wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.

I could see why people think that driverless cars are a good idea because in paragraph 2 Google states that their cars have driven half a millions miles without a crash, but those cars aren't truly driverless, they have a human sitting in it ready to drive and the car alerts them when there's roadblocks, when the driver has to pull out of the driveway, and when there's traffic issues.

The author puts some good details about how they have advanced sensors (paragraph 5) and i can't wait to see the Mercedes, Audi, and Nissan driverless cars in 2020.
