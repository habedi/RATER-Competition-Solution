I'm strongly against because most of the student wouldn't be able to play because most of them have and average of a grade level C and its not that good. In our school you can't play a sport if you have an F or two D' s. Also there's a very few amount of student who have an average of B and that's not going to help if you make a sport were there's have to more then 15 students to play if most of them don't even have an average grade level of a B. If you made the average grade level to be a C there will be a ve lots of student available to play sports. I think that you should make the students not get and F or D if they want to play a sport.

Also the majority of the schools don't let students play any sport if they have a F or D because they need to focus on there school homework. If you had the students vote most of them will be against it because they want to play a sport no matter what. I think that the students who want to play a sport and they have a very low grade you should make them go to programs after school. In our school if you have a bad grade and you want to play a sport you could go to programs after school like afters. I think that your making a bad choice if you choose to make that policy because then you wouldn't have enough students to play sports but you could make programs to help them out after school which most of the students wouldn't want to go because they might think its a waste of time.

Imagine you were one of those students you wouldn't be happy about it because you do want to play that sport really bad because its your passion.
