This is what schools do not want parents to know. Kids attending a regular school waste time in every class they have, it could simply be waiting for another student who didnt complete the homework and had to catch up or a teacher waiting for students to quiet down. Even kids switching classes, at Generic_School we have seven minutes to get to our next class, thats almost thirty minutes of unavoidable time lost every day. Some kids who are seen as less popular at school see school as a extremely stressful place. There are also many upsides to going to a standard public or private school, the most important, the social situations. At school kids are forced to be in uncomfortable social situations from time to time, this is very helpful to get acclimated to all types of behavior before walking out in to the real world. Although Schools keeps kids social, online classes gives students freedom of learning speed, allows they to focus better and lets students learn in a more conferrable environment.

The ability to take online classes from home gives kids freedom of learning speed. They can learn at their own pace, whether thats slower or faster than that pace at school, it would ensure that what they are learning has more of a lasting imprint in their memory. This would also give students the ability to take complete and fruitful notes. Its very common for teachers at standard schools to go through notes slides on PowerPoint was to quickly, only giving kids the chance to copy down the main ideas with very few details. This isnt all bad, it can lead students to understanding the bigger picture. The issue is that not all classes require students to know the bigger picture, more often than not, they are required to know many specific details and facts that may not have been copies down. Some may argue that teachers can post the notes on BlackBoard or Google Classroom, but this requires students to commit even more of their day to getting notes that should not have needed such a severe time commitment to acquire, also adding even more stress in to a students schedule. The most difficult aspect of school is struggling to keep up in one of a students more difficult class. This causes kids to feel stupid, and if they fall behind it causes them to feel even worse about themselves.

Another huge advantage of online classes are that the students have an environment completely distraction free. It allows students to make the best use of their time. It could cut out so much time in fact they could end up ahead of what they would have been in a standard school. Also able to allow to students having more time to relax and sleep which is not very common in many highschoolers. Students knowing that the faster and more efficiently they work, they will be rewarded more free time is very motivating. Where many students at standard school just count down the minutes until the nest class until its finally time go home. They know that they wont get home any sooner of they work hard so they dont. Teachers may argue that students reward is a good grade, but nowadays a student can have average grades and still get into a good college if they simply do well on their SAT and ACT. By average grades I mean all A's, B's and possibly one C, but this is only if the students take honors or AP classes. If kids arent rewarded for their hard work they tend not to be committed to doing so.

The final main advantage of taking classes online is that a student can learn in a completely conferrable stress free environment. Some kids who are seen as weird or 'unpopular' are bullied or looked down upon at standard school. This stresses kids out on top of the regular stresses of school this is over the top for some kids. Other students can also stress about how they look which shouldnt be relevant when trying to learn at school. All these unseen stress factors can build up within a student which is very distracting as well as can make them feel trapped. Therefore its important to many kids to learn in a conferrable safe environment. A non stressful environment makes students want to do their best and when students want to do there best they see just how smart they really are, causing them want to keep learning and excel. Their are many students who would benefit from taking online classes but other who are acclimated to a more social life would feel happier and more upbeat in a standard school. Even though having friends in all your classes can be very distracting, it makes those students more conferrable meaning those student would be better off attending standard school.

Even through school prepares kids for the real social world online classes gives students freedom of learning speed, allows they to focus better and lets students learn in a more conferrable environment. Kids who feel overly stressed at school would greatly benefit from online classes were as others werent. I believe that it should be offered every where and kids would have the ability to pick but there should be a feature on the online schools website that allows you to talk to or communicate with other kids taking the same or similar online classes. This way there is still some social interaction for these kids. And they students doing online school should also be required to partner up with another online scholar to complete projects once a month. this way they still get some what of social interaction which is the one and only disadvantage of taking online classes. therefore the students will have the ability to learn at their own pace in a environment they are conferrable in with no distractions so that they can fully focus.
