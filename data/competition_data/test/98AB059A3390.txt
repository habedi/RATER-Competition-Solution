Venus is a dangerous planet, despite being called the "Evening Star", that scientists want to get more information about. Venus is the brightest "star" we see in the night sky, and tht's how it got it's nickname. This is caused by the extreme amount of heat that is being emitted into the atmosphere of space. The author suggests that Venus should be studied, decpite the dangers, because scientists believe it was once like Earth, NASA suggests having scientists floating above the fray, and NASA is trying to make technology for safer research, so that humanity can learn more about the solar system and find new dicoveries on other planets.

First and foremost, scientists belive this 800 degree planet once held life forms like the ones a person would see on Earth. In paragraph 4, the author states, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth." Then the author talks about the different types of rocks and land forms, as well as the fact that it's the "nearest option for a planetary visit." This explains how Venus could have once been like Earth at one point. Nasa has a couple interesting ways of seeing if these theories are fact or fiction.

Secondly, NASA is thinking of different ways to study Venus. In paragraph 5, the author proclaims, "Imagine a blimp-like vehical hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehical hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." Soon, the author writes about the temperature and the pressure these people would have to deal with. This would show that NASA is thinking of sending scientists above the fray to observe Venus. If sending humans doesn't work out, technology will save the day, or research in this case.

Lastly, NASA wants to also try out technology to study Venus from a safe place, back on Earth. In paragraph 7, the author states, "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexable, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." Earlier in the same paragraph, the author is putting that people have alredy tried to make some kind of technological device that can withstand the forces Venus throws at them. This shows that NASA is working on the technological approach to gain more knowledge of Venus.

All in all, Venus is a dangerous planet that scientists are curious to study and understand. The author believes it's a worthy pursuit, despite the inhospitable conditions because it's simular to the Earth, and NASA is trying to send people and technology up into space so they cay study the planet, so people can learn about the solar system and the planets. This is how great scientists are created, by studying the impossible.
