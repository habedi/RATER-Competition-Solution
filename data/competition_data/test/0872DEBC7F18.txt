Before the last day of school, teachers should let their students pick their own project to do over the summer. Most likely if the student creates the project on there own it would be more fun an easily for them to handle. With that being said if a teacher was to give students their on project to do during the summer it probably wouldn't get done. Students attend to do better on things that they designed using there thoughts and also creativity.

Creating a project on your own during the summer before going back to school. Would definitely be awesome for them to create and do it on there own. They get to do design the project in any type of way or style that they want to and it would be less stressful for them. Especially if your some one that did a lot of fun things & also went places during the break u should be able have to talk about what u learned over the summer. It be less work when u create a project on your own because in your head u already know what your project is going to be about, and u will already know what u will have to do to complete the project.

A student would most likely stress over doing a project over the summer designed from a teacher. Most students freeze up when they don't understand what the teacher is asking to them to do or how to start off. Then when u do the project most of the time people stress about how to start it off or they start over thinking there self that stresses a lot of students when it comes to projects especially designed from the teacher. Then on top of that teachers expect everything to be done in the right way to earn full points on the project.

I personally think that students should be able to create there own project instead of the teachers. It would defiantly be less work for the teacher. Teachers attends to ask for to much when they give u a project to complete. Working and creating a project on your own help u understand things more it also make u think more in a good way. Things become much better and if u design your own project it can be about something simple and easy that u learned over the summer.
