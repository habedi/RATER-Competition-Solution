Principle of SCHOOL_NAME we need to use phone so that we can call or text our parents. So I am with policy 1 we could use the phones to let our parents know were safe if something bad happens at school or other things along the line of that.

I know that most students will not obey this but we can always come up with a compromise to solve the phone policy in steady of not allowing phone in the school. Letting students have their phones at school will pay attention in school and maybe improve our test and CST scores. This will help our scores by giving us freedom so then we will listen to the teachers and learn.

Policy 2 states the fact that phone will be banned from school but most students will not obey the rules and that will cause a lot of people to get in trouble. The more you show t That you can boss us students around then you'll have more problems with us misbehaving and it will be chaos.

Therefore I go with policy 1 cause it gives us some freedom witch will give us more respect to you teachers and principle.
