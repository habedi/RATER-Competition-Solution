In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depiste the dangers in presents" Anyone would love to explore more than just the Earth we live on. Who wouldn't want to know more than what we know already about our planet Earth! Venus is one of the most interesting planets we would want to find more of or know about especially because Venus is our friendly neighbor other than Mars. Venus can be a challenging planet to study, and a very dangerous planet but it can end up being worthy information.

The author uses very good details to describe why Venus is a interesting planet to study. The way the author started off with " Venus is sometimes called the "Evening Star," is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky..." is a very good way to drawl people into the topic of why Venus can be a worthy pusuit despite the danges it presents. Venus is the one of the closest plants to Earth and people often refer it to Earth's "twin' because of the density and size. Venus can be a really challenging planet to study, the way the author used a details about the atmosphere and surface in paragraph 3 sounds even more challenging then what i thought. "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dixoide..." the author even stated that something even more challening than the 97% of carbon is the clouds! it has "highly corrosive sulfuric acid" doesn't that sound interesing but terrifying? The author stated that humans have sent numerous of spacecraft to the land but none of them have survived more than just a few hours.(paragraph 2).That just adds another reason to why Venus is a worthy pursuit to study. I know more scientist are mostly focused on studying Mars more than any other planet but the author is putting the spotlight on Venus and it's full of mystery's. The author also states that the average surface temperature is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90x greater than what we experience on Earth, ISN"T THAT INSANE !!! imangine living on Venus and discovering all these other things we didn't even know that it exists. Venus is also being described to once being just like earth long long time ago. Venus still has some features that can be found on earth such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters (paragraph 4) this should be most definitely be another reason for humans to study Venus the way they study Earth and Mars. Each planet always has something different within each other, but we can't really study planets futher away from earth like Pluto. Pluto isn't referred to being a planet but it is in our glaxay so it should be considered one, we can't really study those planets well like the Mars, but Vensus is another option to study.

The author used a very good reasoning for Venus to be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The Earth, The Moon, and Mars should not be the only planets scientists or NASA studying. Venus most likely has more interesting, mysterious places or objects than just the atmosphere and the surface. Venus sounds like one great and definitely a worthy planet to study.
