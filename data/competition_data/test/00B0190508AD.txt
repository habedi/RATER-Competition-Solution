Dear principal,

I would recommend policy 1 because it is better to at least use your cell phone for a little while than to never use it at all. I would love to be able to have that rule because I know a lot of ways that I can use my cell phone. Like when I'd need help for math I can use my phone as a calculator to work out the math problems easily. And if you need help finding one of your friends that know where your next class is you can just text them. My phone also has Internet so I can look for information about tons of stuff like looking for good info to add to your project. And the biggest rule is that our parents say that they should also be used for emergency calls too. But of course, we know that all of those examples will be used during lunch or in between classes. I know that many students in my school will enjoy this rule a lot because they love to use their cell phones every day. But if you never put up that rule, then lots of kids will start to break the rules again and again. I know that can be very frustrating for you and the counselors knowing that our school has some bad kids in it. So please, can you put up that rule for us? Because that can be so cool.

Sincerely,

One of your best students!
