Summer is what students look forward to every year. For most, there's no homework to worry about or any assignments/ projects to do. But, on the other hand, there are also some schools that require assigned projects during the summer for students so that they continue to learn during their break. For schools that do that, those summer projects should be student-designed and here's why.

With having student-designed projects over the summer, it creates a balance so that students can both enjoy summer and so that they can also have enough time to do any work that needs to get done. For example, students go out and about their day by going to the pool or hanging out with their friends. But, once they get home they can spend those 20-30 minutes to complete parts of their project. That right there is the balance between summer and school. It should be able to fit/work for students. After all, these students do need a break and shouldn't be overwhelmed with work. It is their summer, they shouldn't be robbed out of it with a project.

Now, some might say that during the summer they don't have enough time or that they're too busy with family to complete the whole project. And that's true, students are relatively busy over the summer with plans or vacations with family. So, it's understandable to think that some may not complete the whole project. For instance, a friend of mine travels to a different country every year over the whole summer. How would she be able to complete her project if it was teacher-designed? With making it student-designed it applies to students and how they'll manage their time to finish that project. Any student would be able to finish the student-designed project because, it won't be long. It'd be short but, enough so that students will still continue to learn enough from it.

Let's say that these summer projects would be teacher-designed. The work load would not be fair for students. It would only apply to how the teachers would want and not the students. Teachers would expect them to finish that project regardless of the situation which isn't fair. Then, students would start to become stressed and overwhelmed because they don't have enough time to finish their work. Therefore, they can't enjoy their summer because all they'll end up doing is stressing instead of having fun. It won't be balanced enough for them to do both.

In conclusion, these projects should be student-designed because in the end students are the ones who are doing them, not the teachers. Student-designed projects benefit both teachers and students in the long run. Teachers don't have that much to grade when they get back and they still educate their students at the same time. And as for students, they still have enough time to enjoy their summer and continue to learn at the same time because it was designed for them to.Â
