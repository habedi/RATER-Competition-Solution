Venus is a great planet to study, but they got to worry about the danger of it. The planet is so bright, hot, and has air pressure. People would want to know about the planet, danger of it, and the testing the electronices that they can use.

The scientiest have to study the planet so the people don't die or get hurt while on the planet of Venus. They would have to study the tempereture, air pressure, and the amount of carbon dioxide. In paregraph one it says "Venus is sometimes called the "Evening Star" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actully a planet". The planet is very hot with . the tempereture being around 800 degrees also 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus.

Venus air pressure is 90 times greater than what the experience on our own planet. In paragraph 3 it says "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth". Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system. Spaceships can't land on the planet for more than a few hours therefore they are trying to make some electronics made of silicon carbide.

The scientest are trying to test the silicon carbide electronic so that it can last on the planet of Venus for more than a couple of hours. In paragragh 7 it says"The silicon carbide electronic has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions". There are older technology that are called mechanical computers. The device were first envisioned in 1800s. They also have played and important role in the 1940s during the World War II as a result the planet Venus is a dangerous place to study for humans to land on.

People would like to know about Venus, danger of it, and the testing for the spaceshuttles to land on. Venus is the second planet away for the sun and the first closets to the earth. The planet is dangerous for the spaceshuttles to land on because it is so hot and the air pressure is bad.
