The Risks of Phones While Driving

Technology has been a part of our lives for many years. Within these years, technology has progressed. As it progresses, it causes people to stop paying attention to what needs to be done. This loss of attention can cause different situations to occur such as bumping into other people or hitting a wall while walking. Just as phones are a distraction while doing everyday activities, they are also a distraction while driving. They cause people to not pay attention to the cars around them; they don't know how or when to break, they may roll through a stop sign or just might hit another car all together because they were not focused on what they needed to be focused on. Consequences come with the actions that people take. If a person is not paying attention to the road, then he could cause an accident just as if someone is not paying attention to the person in front of him, he might run into them. There are minor and major risks that come with people being on the phone while driving. Using phones while driving should not be allowed because it is a risky idea and can cause accidents as well as legally affecting a person's driving history.

To begin with, driving is not an activity to do just for fun. It should be taken seriously and all of a person's attention should be on the road. As a result of the loss of attention to the road whether it be visual, manual or cognitive; phones cause accidents. When someone is not paying attention, his reaction time is slower. This could include not paying attention and thinking about everything but what is on the road, a person not having his hands on the wheel or not having his eyes on the road. Because of these things, there are some accidents that are minor where the other vehicle is hit and only leaves a dent in the vehicle where they were hit. But also, some accidents are serious enough to have one or both vehicles totaled, has someone seriously injured or someone could even lose a life from the careless actions of the other driver. So many people have died or have been seriously injured from the careless actions of drivers being on the phone and there is nothing that anyone can do to take it back. Someone's life cannot be taken back. It is not possible to take back hitting someone and paralyzing them or giving them brain damage because of the amount of impact they got from the car that hit them. There are ways to prevent anyone from being in any kind of situation like these. If riding alone, the phone should be in a position where it is hard to reach and should only be touched when at a complete stop or if the car is turned off. No type of notification is worth losing a life over. Also, have the phone where it will not move or slide in places that are hard to reach. If the phone falls underneath the break, it is very dangerous, and it is just as dangerous trying to reach it while driving. Another way to keep everyone on the road safe is to make sure that when passengers are in the car, that everyone understands and respects the rules of the car. Having passengers in the car could be a huge distraction just like phones. Also, having someone to respond to messages and alerts will help eliminate any possible problems. Keeping the car distraction free, especially phone free, will cause for a better rate for not just teenage drivers but all drivers.

Legal actions are also something to consider when someone is driving with a phone in his possession. Seeing police officers on the road instantly puts a fear in people and will cause for a change in actions by the driver. People know what is right and wrong but still do as they please. Hands free driving is a law and it is broken on a daily. People try to alter the law and make it to where it best fits their needs. If an accident is caused because of the carelessness of a driver being on the phone while driving, police marks that on a person's license and too many marks could later lead to the suspension of a person's license. Being on the phone can take time and money away from a person.

Phones are not the only distractions that can go on while someone is driving. They could be talking too much, looking at the stores, signs or other cars or eating. Although these things can be done in a matter of seconds, those few seconds can quickly change. There is so much to life and always being on the phone will never get anyone there especially when driving. A lot of people already do not pay attention without phones and having a phone makes it worse. Whatever it is that comes to your phone can wait. Multitasking while driving is never worth the risk of being hurt or losing a life. It is not worth a life.
