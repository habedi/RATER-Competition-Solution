Texting and Driving

Since the start of mobile devices in 2005, sixteen percent of car crashes are caused by distractions of mobile devices. Most being teenagers. Texting and driving has cause many fatal accidents. As of July 1,2018, Georgia is now a hands-free state.

Because I have brought up the hands-free law, let us discuss it. Drivers are not to have any mobile devices in their hands. They're required to use: speakerphone, earpiece, bluetooth, or an electronic watch. While driving a driver can not send messages, read social media, or make videos. These reasons cause accidents. If a driver is: reporting a crash, medical emergency, fire, suspicious activity, or hazardous road conditions is the driver allowed to use their mobile devices.

The vast majority of car crashes in Georgia have been in rear-end crashes, single-car crashes and crashes by drivers from 15 to 25 years-old. There are 15 states that have passed the hands-free law. In those fifteen states, they have saw a 16 percent decrease in fatalities. The fine for being caught is: First Offense $50 and one point on your license, Second Offense $100 and two points on your license, Third Offense $150 and three points on your license.
