Decoding teenage emotions and facial expressions proves difficult for adults, but now there is new technology to help those students learn more effectively. The help of Facial Action Coding brings new opportunities to the classroom with prospects of working lessons around what each individual student is feeling. The system would bring better learning to students easier with help of individualized teaching by recognizing when a student gets confused or unhappy with the lesson.

A computer with this coding system in its hardware could change the way students learn and how teachers teach. The learning process would be more individualized, because the computer works around what makes that specific user smile. "For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." The computer will ultimately pick what to show on the screen based on one's past reactions to previous stimuli. This system would help students understand a lesson by changing the way it teaches to help the student. It would no longer be one teacher teaching a lesson broadly, it would be one computer teaching a lesson that specifically helps the student. This would lead to more efficient learning and overall better test scores. The computer with Facial Action Coding System will turn a struggling student into a more efficient and educated student.

The use of this technology would be effective by using accurate ways to study students' facial expressions. Developing an accurate system is the foundation of an accurate learning environment for students. The system is a facial expression expert; it knows when you are actually enjoying something or not through studying the specific muscles you use. "To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful." Each muscle holds a different purpose, and the Facial Action Coding System studies each one to pinpoint which emotion is being expressed.

The developers of this product have studied greath lengths over this material, and suggest that da Vinci did the same. The accuracy of their product is based off of psychologists, professors, and doctors to get an accurate description of basic human expression and muscle movement. "Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code." Having an effective foundation to the software will lower the risk of inaccurate studies of facial expressions.

To conclude, the Facial Action Coding System is an asset to classrooms everywhere. Struggling students can learn effectively without raising a finger; all they have to do is react as they normally would. The accuracy and development of this software helps read each student's individualized emotion such as confusion, boredom, or anger. The computer acts as an individualized instructor, acting on each emotion and reaction to new material.
