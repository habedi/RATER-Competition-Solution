I disagree with the mandatory extracurricular policy for three main reasons. First, I believe it is unfair to students who don't wish to be forced into doing an extracurricular activity. Second, I know that students who already participate in any extracurricular outside of school like sports, gymnastics, or dance would be forced to do even more than they already did. It would add to an already busy schedule for those students. I also believe that it is a basic right a student has, to be able to leave school when school is over. Unless you have detention or some sort of consequence for getting in trouble, you should be allowed to leave the school when it is over.

It is a very simple fact. Kids do not always want to stay at school longer than they already have to. If they do not wish to participate in any after school activities why could the school still make them do it anyway? It does not make sense from the point of view of a student. Kids have other things they want to do. They would much rather have time to hangout with their friends, be watching TV, playing video games, and doing homework, than being forced stay after school doing something they don't want to.

A second group of students who would have a problem with this policy would be students who already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school. They could have sports practices up to four or five times a week. I know personally I practice swimming twice per week and basketball and soccer once. That means during four days of the week I would be doing my homework and going to practice. If I had and after school activity on top of all of that, I would be in big trouble when it comes to school and my grades. I also know some other kids who have worse schedules than I do. I doubt they would want to be forced to add on to the immense workload they already have.

My third an final reason I believe this would be a bad policy, is because a student should have the right to be able to leave school. Unless you have some sort of punishment like detention, it should be a students right to be able to leave school once the day is completed. It would be seen as unfair if they were forced to stay and do something they don't want to do. They would make the whole system worse anyway. It would all be less productive because the people who are forced to be there would drag their feet and be lazy. The only people who should participate in after school clubs should be the people who want to be there, and people who want to be productive.

In conclusion, I believe that this would be a policy that would have a negative effect on students as well as the clubs that would be taking these students in the first place. I believe that is is unfair to kids who just don't want to stay at school longer and wish to go and do what they would want to do in their free time. I also believe that it is unfair to students who already participate in activities outside of school during the week. It would add a lot more to their already busy schedules. Finally, I also believe that it should be the right of the students to be able to leave if they want to. If they want to go have a social life and have fun, the school should allow them to do that. That is why I believe that students should have a choice about whether or not they want to participate in these programs.
