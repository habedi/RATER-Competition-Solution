"Driverless Cars Are Coming" when you hear this title most people would be either 1.) excited or 2.) questioning this. As I read the passage I noticed how the article put both pros and cons too this in my opinion I think this development towards these cars is awful. The reason why I say this is because I think all drivers should take responsibility and drive how they're doing right now so many things can go wrong with having a car who only alerts you when you either pull in and out of a driveway. Or when there is complicated issues ahead , for example in order to have these types of cars around.

You would have too be really exact on the senors that are being installed into every single car that is shipped out , if something goes wrong while doing this process and someone ends up purchasing the car. It can cause them their life or someone else's if they end up losing complete control and creating a bigger situation. So many companies have tried getting these types of cars created but something always either goes wrong somewhere or it's just too expensive to install.

It also speaks about how the sensors make sure the driver is keeping a hold of the wheel , but what if the driver is under the influence and cannot take over when a emergency occurs ? Will the car not go anywhere or will it continue to drive. I don't think the states of California, Nevada,Florida,and the District of Columbia should allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. They're still unsafe have not correctly gotten everything they need in them if they were to distribute its still considered dangerous. I'm not for the idea but if the manufactures are considering this I think this is going to have to be thought about a lot and take time considering a 6 year project at least. But this is why I believe that making "Driverless Cars" is not such a good idea.
