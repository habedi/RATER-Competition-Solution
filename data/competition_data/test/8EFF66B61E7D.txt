Community Service, It's A Great Thing!

What's a better way to make our environment a lot healthier and safe? What could we do too make sure our community safe and environment friendly? There is a lot of things we can do. But there is only so few Elementary, Middle School and High School students who actually take the time to help out their community.

If everybody spent a half hour inside or outside working too make the community look better, they would be happy with what the results would be. Then everybody would help more, which would allow them to work for longer.

Although when it becomes hot out, we would probably rather want to be hanging out with your friends or swimming. The best way to be active is playing outside. Who ever said that doing community service meant we had to do it alone, or with people you did not know? Bring your friends and family members into it. Instead of only working at school, take your work home with you. Having friends and teachers is the best way too do something you don't really want to do in the first place. It gets your mind off of what your actually doing, before long the half hour goal you set soon becomes and hour.

Even though community service doesn't sound like the most greatest thing in the world, look at who and what your helping. In the future it will make a difference. It will be a chain reaction, as soon as you start helping around your school and neighborhood more and more will do the same. Maybe you could start something knew around your community. It will make a difference. It shouldn't matter what the age is, it's never to late to help out around your community.
