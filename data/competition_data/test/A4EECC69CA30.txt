Online school really sounds great, but is it really. Many people believe that taking classes from home is beneficial, but I think otherwise. Some may argue that you can get better rest and not have as much stress whihc are good things, but overall I think it is not a good idea. Most kids in school learn much better face to face with a teacher and not online. I have taken one class online for spanish in middle school to help me lern more and preform at the best of my ability, but I found myself losin focus. One of the biggest parts of school is the physical interaction with other people and online classes can not provide that for you. Classes at home would take away the social part of school, distract students from learning, and doesn't give you the chance to play sports at your High School.

Being social is one of the most important parts of school and society in general. Everyday I am excited to go to school to talk to my friends or even meet new friends. Taking classes from you room would completely diminish social interaction with kids. My latin class had none of my friends in it with me, which forced me to talk to new people and make friends. I became friends with people I wouldn't think of talking to our getting to know better. One of my sisters friends from middle school was home schooled up until the 8th grade. She seemed very different than all of the other kids in which she wasn't very social and didn't talk much. This is an example of how having classes at home can completely change a kids life for the worse. I went to a very small school from elementary school to the end of middle schooland knew every single person that went there. Making the switch to Generic_School was one of the biggest things I've ever had to do. From a class of 40 students to a class of 500 and going from 8 classes a day to 4 classes rotating off every day was a huge change for me. Making new friends took awhile, but all of these things helped me adapt and learn a lot about how I had to change and apply myself differently.

If I had to do online school I would barely get any work done. All of the distractions at my house would take me away from my work and not allow me to get anything done. At school there are very few distractions. We talk to eachother and go on our phones, but still we learn and pay attention in class. At home I would wake up late every morning, play video games, and have no motivation at all to get any work done online. Teachers watch over their students while they are taking test so they can't cheat on them, while at home every single student would be getting 100% on every assignment because nobody can stop them from cheating. That would stop everyone from learning the information because there is no need to study when the answers are sittting right infront of you. A girl who used to play on my team was homeschooled and would barely talk to use about anything. When we asked her about home schooling she said would get great grades on everything since it was online and she could just find the answers infront of her. Nobody understood since we were young and weren't homeschooled.

Playing sports at Generic_School is one of my favorite things to do. Trying out for soccer and making the team has given me the chance to become a better player and meet some of my best friends. If I were to be at home taking classes I wouldn't have the chance to even meet them or get better. Sophmore year I was terrified to tryout because I didn't know anyone on the team. From my perspective I thought I wasn't good enough for the team and they didn't need me. After I made the team I felt very welcomed to the squad by everyone and shortly became great friends with all of them. Taking classes takes all of these priviledges away from kids. Sports at school help you bond and gain teamwork skills that online school can't offer you. Online school can't teach you about being social or having teamwork and that is what I think school is all about.

Online classes would ruin my school experience by allowing kids to cheat and not learn the material, taking about sports, and not being able to socialize and make friends in your classes. The great thing about school is that you never know what friends will be in your class, or if you are going to have to make new friends. High School always prepares you for he real world without you even knowing. I have learned how to interact with adults and other students while being polite and using manners. With online school you wouldn't get the opportunities that school provides you. Online school may have its benefits, but I believe the weaknesses outweigh them.
