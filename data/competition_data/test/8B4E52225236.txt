Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? If the school offers online teaching then yes, students should be able to attend class from home. The students can work at their own pace, be in the comfort of their own home, and if the student is sick they will not miss anything in the class.

Although the school gives learning from a distance as an option. Some students decide not to take the offer because they like to be in a learning environment. While other students might take up on the option of attending class from home and not do learn anything. Having to do class work from home students might get too comfortable and lazy and not want to do any work. Also will take advantage of the opportunity meaning those who do not do the work will never succeed.

Being able to have classes from home means students can work at their own pace. Sometimes in classes teachers tend to go fast and not go back. Which makes it hard for some to absorb the information and actually learn. While others feel like the class is going at a slower pace for them. Every student is different and has a different way of learning and obtaining information. So if they do class work at home at their own pace the student can go back take it slow and really understand what they are learning.

Doing online classes means you could be in the comfort of your own home. Living in the now schools might not be a safe place anymore. Which causes students to focus on their safety and not about their studies. Meaning they will not be focusing as much on what the teacher is saying or teaching. So taking classes at home makes then more comfortable and able to focus. Even when the class might be through video chat the student is aware of what is going on and is comfortable at home.

Having a sickness or being sick sometimes affects the days you can go to school. Use me as an example I have a stomach sickness when in a certain time of the day I have to use the bathroom. I usually miss a lot of class time due to this. When I return to class I realize I have missed a whole lesson. So being able to do an online class at home would catch me up and help me have access to a bathroom at anytime I need without missing any work.

In the end of it, all students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. It helps students work at their own pace, lets them be in the comfort of their own home, and helps them not have to worry about being sick and missing something. All schools should offer distance learning for everyone to have that opportunity.
