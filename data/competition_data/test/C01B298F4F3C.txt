Students abhor teachers telling them what to do. They would count of how many days left until break to come and rescue them from boredom. Individuals want to do something without others telling them what they should or have to do. Instead of doing homework and exams, they enjoy doing projects that excites them. Having the teacher assign a task for them over summer break would be a horrible idea. The students wouldn't listen to the teachers and having the students to design their own project would mean that they would use their creative, original thought.

It's not fun when teachers gives you an assignment to do over the weekend or break. My teachers would give all their students to work over the summer so it can prepare them for next year classes. They would either have us do a book report about what we read over the summer or hand us a packet to do math equations. ThisÂ is not at all what I planned to do over the summer. Instead, I did what I want to do to have an unforgettable summer.

The teachers giving us an opportunity to think about what project we should do over the summer would change the students point of views. My physics teacher wanted his students to do a project that has anything to do with physics. It made me wonder what I should do to make this work more enjoyable and exciting to do. While I was thinking, my cat fell off the counter and landed on her feet. This made me do my research and I learned interesting articles explaining that. I wanted it to test it out myself to see if its actually true. This made a huge difference of how I see everything in our world today. There's so much more to discover than sitting in your desk and doing a worksheet.

Students couldn't do a project that relates to school. The teachers teaching and giving them work would help them focus in life. It prepares them for what they need to overcome the obstacles. Giving the students to work over the summer would help to excel for their future classes and not fall behind other students. Furthermore, They will have the knowledge to help them in their difficult life and get through their struggles.

Letting the students to come up with their own project would have them use their creative, original ideas. This would broaden their horizons of how they see their own world. They can discover new things and would make them to keep learning. They can tell everyone about the stuff they find out and would make themselves feel good. This would leave an impact for those children. This is a huge step for students to move forward and succeed in life.
