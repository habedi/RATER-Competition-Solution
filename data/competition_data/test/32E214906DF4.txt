Dear Principle,

I think that students shouldn't be forced to do community service unless the won't to. They should not be forced to do they community service if they did not something wrong. Just let them have of choice whether they want to do it or not. Take a serve to see if student students wants to do they community service.

They should not have to be forced because its not required. Sometimes when we get forced to do something we don't do a great job. Most of us if you ask for our help to do something we would do it. Just see it from a student's view and not just see it from yours.

Just if you want us to help keep our community safe and clean just ask.

If you gave us a choice and we thought that we should do it and we vote to do it then, we would not have a problem with doing community service. Some of us think its not our job to help the community, but it is. We live in the community so we should be responsible for it. Some of us think that if we didn't do anything bad to the community then we shouldn't help at all. I think that we should do it but, give us a choice first before you do anything.

Take a serve to see how many students would volunteer. If you have enough students helping then don't make us all help. If all of us students are willing to help then that's a good thing. Just tell us in the serve what we would have to do and tally up the scores and see who would all like to do it. The serve would be a good way to see who like to do something and who wouldn't like to do it.

At the end of the day it's your choice whether you won't us students to do it or not. Just know forcing someone to help isn't the best way to ask student's to help. Giving a serve would be a better way to see if your student's want to help the community. If you gave us a choice to do it or not its most likely not every one would help. Just
