Have you ever done extracurricular activities after school? Well in my school our principle makes all the students do extracurricular activities including sports,working on the year book ,and serving in the student council. I agree with this new rule because of these two reasons. It makes you more healthy when you join sports, and It helps you socialize more, also you can make new friends.

As I was saying doing extracurricular activities can make you healthy. It makes you healthy by just running around and exercising. It also makes you healthy by you just having fun. If your sad playing sports can make you happy and something to look forward to at the end of the day. and my final reason on why extracurricular activities after school makes you healthy is you have something to do after school; instead of being bored at your house you can run around and play with others. and that brings me to my next point.

my second point of why extracurricular activities after school is good for you is you get to socialize more. This is good because Its good to talk to others. Another thing thats good about socializing is it helps keep you out of trouble. for example when you are talking to your friends then that means you are ignoring the bad stuff theirs going on around you. finally My final reason on why socializing is good for you is that it makes you earn friends. Having fun and socializing with someone is a good thing and with extracurricular activities after school you can easily make friends.

In conclusion extracurricular activities after school is a good thing because you get to stay healthy and meet new and fun people. I really think people should do extracurricular activities after school because you will have fun and it will not hurt to try some things that interest you.
