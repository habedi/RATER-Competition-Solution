The problem we have at hand here is whether or not we should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. My thesis is we all should join the program and help everybody ravanged by the war. It helps a ton of people get better and it also gives you a good gut feeling that everybody loves to have. In the following text I am going to give you some of the reasons why we should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program and help other people.

My first reason we should all go into the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get the wonderful oppertunity to help other people. The people you will be helping have had there homes destroyed by war and all of their personal belongings including food, water, and any gifts they might have gotten. Think about the smiles and tears of joy when you arive at these peoples' houses bearing gifts of food and animals to keep them stocked up on food.

My second reason we should all join the Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to see all of breathtaking sights as you travel the sea on a boat. These places you will be going to will have a ton of awesome sight seeing spots on the way to enjoy with all of the other Seagoing Cowboys. Also once you drop off all of the animal you can do a lot of really fun stuff with all of your buddys. For example vollyball, baseball, and a lot lot more cool activitys and games.

In the Seagoing Cowboys program it is dangorous and I will give the other side who do not want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program that. I bet if you are saying it is dangerous and it is not worth the risk that you have never tried to help a lot of people before. When you help a lot of people you get the amazing feeling that by risking your one life you probably just saved a hundred more lives just by going on a month to two month trip from the spot you are in to the spot you are going.

In conclusion you should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a great oppertunity to help other people that have lost their homes and to see a lot of breathtaking sights that you would not normally get to see. It is dangorous but you can see all of the joy and relief that you are giving to the people who have suffered great loss do to the ravanging way the war has treated them. I know that if you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys that you could be the thing that people in other countries dream of coming the next day with the gift of savour for them and their familys.
