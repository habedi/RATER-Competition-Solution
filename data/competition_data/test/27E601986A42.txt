I don't think we need driverless cars. It just makes humans even more lazy and is probably a waste on resoureces as well as time. My position on driverless cars are they are not needed just the fact that no one needs to have it. In paragraph seven it states, "The car can handle functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but special touch sensors make sure that driver keeps hold of the wheel. This statement basically states that the car can only go up to twenty-five mph, but you have to be holding the wheel for it to do this. so your basically just sitting there as it just goes the only thing your not working is the gas. You would have to watch just because if you were have to work between work zones or accidents.

The most important thing for a driver in a car is safely. This car is pose to help that part out by using cameras to watch the driver and the road. If they were to defunction or break how would you get another one or would you be able to buy them in the store or pay for them again from the company. Also if the technology or the car were to fail while the driver is distracted or worst and someone were to get injuried, who is held in charge for it. Will the driver face the charge or the manufactures who made it?

Not to mention it doing all of this stuff at once, how much gas can go for one mile. We are trying to build cars that can go farther and not have that much gas, so what will be the milage on this car that can drive itself. Will it run off of batteries, fossil fuels or something that doesn't harm the environment.

This ends my position on driverless cars on the road. I think it's not a good idea based off the fact that we came this far driving cars without them driving for us or anything like it. We can go without cars driving themsevles, what we need to focus on is can we improve how far a car goes with just one gallon of gas so improving their mph. This would help people go farther without the cost of gas it would slow down the rate of resources going down and help our environment.
