I think it would be fair to say that more than half of students at my school participate in some type extracurricular. Most schools offer a wide variety of extracurriculars to participate in from soccer to theater, or govenment, there are hobbies for whatever you would like to try! I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps kids find what they are interested in, a positive social activity, and supports a healthier lifestyle.

One major reason I think all students should participate in an extracurricular is because it can ignite new interests. If you don't encourage kids to participate in extracurricular, how will they know what they are interested in? You never know if you like something until you try it.

People who go into the NFL and NBA don't just show up one day and start playing, they found their intrest when they were younger and stuck with it. Many of our past presidents were involved with their school student government in high school. Students can get scholarship opportunities if they are very talented at their hobby. If they are enjoy that activity a lot, and are committed to what they are doing, it could possibly become their future career.

Another reason all kids should participate in an extracurricular is because it's a good social activity. You take a look around my school you will notice kids who do sports or take part in band are more talkative and friendly. Joining a club or sport team would help students socialize with people they usually wouldn't talk to otherwise. Many kids bond with their peers they do that extracurricular with, making more friends. It can give people a sense of belonging.

Lastly, extracurriculars support a healthier lifestyles. Having to do a sport or club would get more kids off their phones and outside their house, away from their beloved XBOX. With child obesity on the rise in the United States, it would'nt be a bad idea to have more kids exercise, whether its their body or mind! This would encourage more people to be involved in their school community, making kids probably like school more. It has been proven that the people who usually have better grades are the one who take part in a sport or club.

Overall, everyone should join an extracurricular because of all of the benefits. I think all students should participate in a some type of extracurricular or some type of hobby, because it can ignite new interests in things kids might have thought they did'nt even like, create new friendships with people in their school community, and support a positive lifestyle!
