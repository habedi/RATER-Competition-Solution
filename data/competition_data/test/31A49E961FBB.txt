"Distracted Driving is a No-Go"

In a recent Google search, it was estimated that about "1.2 billion people drive in the world". Imagine if every driver had a cell phone, and used it while driving, this would cause a lot of distractions and possible deadly accidents. It is my belief that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Today's generation is really the most tech savvy because now people trying to use their phone while driving and it is very dangerous. Teens are very distracted by their phone and when they get a call or text they try to pick it up while driving that's why people need hand free Bluetooth in their car. According to Esurance, "cognitive or mental distraction is when a driver's mind isn't focused on driving. Talking to another passenger or being preoccupied with personal, family, or work-related issues are some examples." Teens would rather make snapchat videos then driving. While you drive put your phone on do not disturb while you drive or you put on their manual so it knows that you driving.

Secondly, you can also can get in a deadly accident while trying to text and drive. According to an Usa Today article," In Houston, the driver of a pickup truck that collided with a church minibus in rural Texas, killing 13 people, apologized after the crash and acknowledged he had been texting while driving." People don't know how dangerous it is for you text and drive, until it's too late.

In a recent google search, it has been "1.6 billon crashes each year by texting and driving". Those are scary numbers!

Although, they made a new law that people in Georgia can't have their phones in their hands while driving. According to Alive, "Georgia's hands-free law took effect on Sunday, July 1, 2018. It is a sweeping, landmark measure that has been under consideration for several years and will affect all of us as Georgians in one way or another." People can't send or watch a video while driving. The hand free law is all over Georgia and they trying to spread it around the world so people hold their phone at all. Even though the law is in place, I see on a daily, drivers still using their phones.

In the end, people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it is not safe for people around the world. The law keeps the people safe and it is up to us to enforce and follow the laws to keep all drivers and passengers safe on the road.
