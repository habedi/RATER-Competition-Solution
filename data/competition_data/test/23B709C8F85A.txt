Although summer assignments designed by teachers are proven to be more professional and effective for student learning while they are on their break, summer projects should be created by students because it will prove less stressful and more lenient for the students to complete assignments made by their peers rather than their teachers.

Summer assignment that are student-designed will prove to be a more lenient workload than assignments made by teachers. Summer projects made by teachers usually include a tremendous workload with more than just one thing to do. For example, in the summer of my freshman year of high school, my world history teacher assigned the class a one hundred paged packet where we had to answer fifteen questions on each page. To complete that project I had to complete one page a day, but by the time the new year came around I still was not able to finish the assignment. That assignment had proven to be extremely difficult and excessive in its workload, as a result I was not able to complete it. Students are capable are creating assignments that will prove that projects do not need to be excessive in workload to assure that they are learning. For example, in my English class, we were given an assignment where the students had to create a worksheet with questions created on our own then give it to another student to complete. When I received my peer's worksheet, the questions were not so easy to where I didn't have to think at all but it proven just difficult enough to complete without thinking as hard. This example is made to show how when students are the ones creating the assignments it demonstrates how a student can receive learning from the assignment but it is not as rigorous as the assignments designed by teachers. Even though teacher-designed projects are designed for the strict purpose of assuring learning, student designed projects prove learning can be achieved but it is achievable without the tremendous workload.

Teacher-designed projects have proven to be extremely stressful on students and summer assignments created by students will relieve other students of that stress. A majority of the time, projects made by teachers are so difficult that they inflict stress and anxiousness in the students because of the fear they will not complete it. For example, for the same history project I had to complete during the summer of freshman year, the difficulty and the length of the packet inflicted fear and anxiousness in me that I would not be able to finish the assignment. These type of projects inflict stress on students and stress is not good for the mental health of growing teenagers. Whenever students create assignments they not only create what is most academically suited to them, but also create assignments to where they won't have go over their limits and won't have to stress themselves out either. Although teacher-designed assignments prove effective of students knowledge of the topics the assignments are based on, assignment made by students will not only assure learning but will prove to be less stressful for the students completing the assignment.

In conclusion, summer projects should be created by the students rather than the teachers because students know how difficult and stressful summer assignments can be, as a result they can make assignments that will not only assure learning over the break, but won't inflict stress and hardship onto the students who have to complete it. Teachers have always designed assignments assigned over the break to make sure student do aquire learning while being away from school. Student projects should always remain learning but the assignments given to them should not be so difficult to the point where they are fearful and stress over not completing it. Because of this, summer projects should be student-designed for the sake of the students mental health and to prove that summer assignments do not need to be excessive in its workload to ensure learning.
