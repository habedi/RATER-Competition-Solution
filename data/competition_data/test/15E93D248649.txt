Dear principal,

I believe students should use there cell-phones during lunch periods or other free times because it gives them a sense of freedom, and occupies their time. Student have a ton of reasons why they need to use cell-phone, but they leave out the good reasons.

Some students do not choose to bring cell-phones to school, my mom makes me, just in case something happens to her or me. Now other students may have the same reasons, and we are not gonna say no to bringing our cell-phones. Some teachers may even encourage it what harm could they cell phones really do just make sure the are off in every class period, so when they walk in tell then to take out their cell-phones make the teachers check to see that they are off and go on with the call period, and if you see then confiscate them until the end of they day or until parents pick them up. I would like if you took my reasons into consideration when you make your decision on your new policy. Besides don't you want all the students to think that you are the best principal and that our school is the best ever, I know I would.

Your Student,
