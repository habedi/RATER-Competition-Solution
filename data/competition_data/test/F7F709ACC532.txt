Dear Principal,

Kids have always played sports, with no set grade average. Requiring the students to have at least a B grade average will not only stifle the kid's ability to participate in after school activities, it would require them to try and push themselves even harder than they are now, which is a huge additive of stress to their current amount. Many kids have a C grade average, and are trying their hardest to keep it there. Kids in my school, have lots of homework to do already. Because of the amount of homework that is put upon kids every day, kids would not be able to participate in sports as much as they would without an average grade requirement.

Given the current amount of kids that play sports at least one season out of the year, most have about a C average. If you required kids to have at least a B average, then those many kids would have to quit sports, and would not be allowed to play until they brought their grades up to a B in every class, at the least. With the struggle of at home conflicts, and other factors, like music lessons, and sports that kids already play, keeping their grades up is a huge issue.

Most often, kids who play sports, have a easier time keeping their homework completed, but that does not necessarily mean that they get all A' s on their homework and their tests. Sports help kids clear their minds. Kids with C averages would not be able to reap the benefits of the extra curriculum activities.

Creating the B average minimum on sports would add a burden to the kids, as much as it would if at work, an adult was asked to do extra paper work every day, and no one wants that. So please take into consideration what you are doing and if you benefit the learning of the students.

Sincerely,
