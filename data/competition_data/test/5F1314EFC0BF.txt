Many schools use summer projects to insure that students are still learning during summer break. Some people would say these projects should be designed by the teachers. Whereas others would say the projects should be designed by the students. For many reasons, summer projects should be designed by the teachers.

Teachers are more organized in their planning. If a student organizes a summer project then there would not be a project to turn in, because some students are irresponsible and dont even know how to put together a project and will not ask for someone to teach them. Teachers would also be able to control what the projects about, how its going to be made, and when its going to be turned in. If a student decides what the project is about, how its going to be made, and when to turn it in then the teachers when school starts would have a very unorganized load of unknown projects to grade.

Projects are much easier for teachers to grade if the projects are on one subject. If a student is able to design his or her own project then there would be many topics that don't even match what the class is for. Letting a student design a summer project would be like letting a student design their own test and giving it to the teacher to grade. Then the teacher would have to find the answers to the test, make an answer sheet, and grade over two hundred individualized papers. Thats why teachers make their own test for the students to take so that the teachers have one test to grade it wont take hours to grade it will take minutes.

Some may say by letting the students organize and plan their own summer project would help boost their imagination. Though thats true, letting the teachers make a creative project would also boost the students imagination. Teachers need to be able to grade the papers which goes back to organization. A student can be creative when doing the project but when actually designing the project, teachers have to have a subject for the students to do the project on. Otherwise the teachers for summer reading would have to read every book a student has read over the summer instead of assigning just one book for everyone to read, or even in history class if a teacher just hands out a project with no subject then the student could easily do the project on something they haven't even learned.

It is the teachers job to give the student something to do. It is not the teachers job to overwhelm the students with designing their own project. If a teacher can design and give out home work then they should also be able to design and give out summer project for students to do. Teachers are not paid to sit in their chair and say " Theres a project, figure it, out have a good summer." They are paid to actually create and design a project, give it to the students with instructions on how to do it, and say " This is due the first week of school have a great summer."Â
