According to the NHTSA "In a split second, you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone you love." This can happen with cell phone usage while driving. To be more specific, you have to look at your phone in order to text and you have to look at the road in order to drive. Which makes cell phones a distraction while driving. Therefore drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause distracted driving which can lead to accidents and danger to pedestrians.

Driving while distracted can be anything that takes your attention off the road and on to something else. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death among teenage drivers. According to a survey conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, more than 90 percent of drivers know texting while driving is dangerous. Recently there was an accident in Tennessee caused by a bus driver who killed three victims because he decided to text and drive. Texting and driving is dangerous and deadly.

Anne McCartt, is a senior Vice president for the highway safety says in the article, "No Phones, Safer Roads", that "Whether hand held or hands free, talking on the phone while driving increases your risk of having a crash." This is true because driving with your head down or eyes on something else can cause you to possibly lose control of the wheel and increase your chances of having an accident. For example you cannot expect to walk around with your eyes closed and not hurt yourself. It is the same as with driving you cannot drive with no eyes on the road and not expect to crash and cause hurt to you and your passengers.

Although some people may think that using hand free devices is okay. However, going hands free does not actually prevent the driver from being distracted. Because they still have to put hands on in order to answer the phone or text. It can actually be just as distracting as hands on for the driver. .

Do you know how many people have died in 2018 due to texting and driving? Well it's most definitely tragic. In 2018 about 3,287 people have died because of texting and driving. Which is a good thing that they made no texting and driving a law. When you're distracted, who's driving? Make sure you think twice before picking up your phone while driving.
