Dear Mr. Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I have been thinking about what your trying to do about students being required to do community service. In my opinion I say that yes students should be required to do community service because doing good for our planet is good for us and it could be fun. Community service is not only about picking up trash is also about helping ourselves if there was no community services then by know we will be living in a pile of trash, but we are lucky of having it and we need more people to join.

Another reason why students should do community service is because it could also help us with our personality and our life. This could change someone's life because what about if a student does drugs and is a bully and then is required to join community service and ends up liking it. This student changes to a person that is know very caring and gave up drugs because he feels good about himself. I think im going to join community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
