Dear Principal,

Many students try their best in school, but they just can't get it right.

I believe that a grade C average is still passing, so therefore they should be able to play a sport or participate in activities.

If a student tries their best and works for success they should be able to participate in after school activities at their school.

If they are failing they should focus on academics first instead of after school activities or sports. A grade C average is still passing so they should be able to participate in after school activities.

If you had to have a grade B average to play or participate in activities many people wouldn't be able to join, so our school would need players to be in a sports team.

I think you are being unfair to these students that try to be successful by not letting them participate in school activities or sports.

Also they can get pulled out of one of their electives to go to tutoring classes.

They deserve the same things another student gets if they have a grade average of B or higher.

That is what they probably need to motivate them to get a higher grade average.

They need to play sports or participate in school activities.
