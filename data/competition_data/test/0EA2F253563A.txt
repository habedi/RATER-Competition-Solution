In our society, students are sometimes offered the opportunity to take a class online rather than in person. There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not students benefit from taking online classes. Those who state it is beneficial believe it is convenient for the sick or injured and students can have better focus, but this is not the case. Although some may disagree, there are less benefits from attending classes at home.

There are a variety of reasons why taking classes at school is more beneficial than taking them at home. One reason is less procrastination. When working from home one may be tempted to continuously put off the work. At school students do the work, turn it in and are then done, no worries about having to come back to it later. Being more focused is also a reason students should take classes in person. School environments are made to keep a student focused and encourage them to learn. A home is for people to come to after work or school to relax and take ones mind off the day. Going to school to take classes gives students the opportunity to be more social. In person students can spend time with friends while also making new ones. Socially isolating ones self can mentally effect a person and make communication harder.

There are other reasons as to why students should take in person classes. Teachers are present if students have questions. If a student does not understand something a teachers assistance is just a hand raise away. There are students who do not learn only through instruction and may need a little extra explanation or even an example. Students could resort to cheating at home. If there is something a student does not know they could be tempted to search up answers. In school students are less likely to cheat because they have the resources they need right in front of them. When taking in school classes it prepares students for the real world outside of school. In school students are taught a variety of ways to work with other people, such as in a group or one on one. Knowing how to communicate and work with others is important, for example, like when applying for a job.

Although some may disagree, There are more benefits in taking classes in school. This is the cause due to students being more focused, procrastinating less and learning how to communicate with others. Those who disagree with taking classes in school state online classes are better for the sick or injured and it can help students focus better but this is not the case. This topic is important because although many students would jump at the opportunity to take their classes in the comfort of their own bed, they may not consider the other factors of not being in school.
