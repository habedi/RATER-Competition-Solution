The article Making Mona Lisa smile by Nick D'Alto refers to a new piece of technology that allows people to see exactly how others feel, or react in certian situations. The device was created by Dr. Huang and measures facial muscle moments then associates them with emotions. The device has proven to be succesful at reading emotions of real people and portrait paintings. Using this piece of technology in the classroom would be beneifical for all parties involved.

Students experience a wide range of emotions during the average school day. The new tool could be used to indentify all of them. Starting with analysis of how students are feeling right when they walk in the door. This would be helpful to the school because it would allow them to identify students that need help as suggested by Dr. Huang. Eliminating the need for teachers to ask students for questions. Teachers would know exactly when students had a question, because he or she was making a face of confusion.

The emotion reading computer could also tell guidence councilers how children are really feeling about their current situation. Allowing for a deeper more pesonal conversation that would create a better enviroment for healing the students emotions.

Another, way that the machine could be helpful is that it could help teachers interven before students brawl. Instead of fighting the machine would assist those in charge by seeing the issue before it becomes one. According to Nick D'Alto the machince currently searches for the emotions, anger, surprise, happiness,disgust,fear,and sadness. Technology continues to make advances everyday and this machine would be able toe search for more emotions everyday.

Students require a vivid and visually entertianing lesson, with the new technology this is possible. Dr Huang believs that the machine could search for the emotion of boredom and then suddenly change the way the students recieve the message based on their attentiveness. This would be more useful because some teachers do not change they way they present the information. Technology with the ability to adapt to the needs of the students is important and another reason why it shoul dbe incorperated into school systems.

Others argure that the technology could be bad for schools. Some poeple believe that it would be a waste of the public's time to invest in something that can already be done by a person. Dr. Huang himself compared the compter to something similar to what humans would do when looking at emoitions of others. It would take jobs away from the area replacing teachers. These all may be true, but sometimes people missread emotions. Teacher can not teach and think about how ever childs emotions at the same time, this new technology would help teachers.

This computer could most definatley be benifical to schools, because of its ability to identfy emotions. The machine could help notify teachers of confused studnets, help guidence councilers identify the true meaning of how students feel, and finally help staff stop situations before they can come up. All togther these reasons show that this technology is needed in schools on a global scale. The combination of both school and technology is the future and this is definately something that will be incorperated soon.
