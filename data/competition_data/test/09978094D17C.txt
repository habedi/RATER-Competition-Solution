I think that people that have online school won't attended because there not at actual school so there just like i can do this later in the day when i guess you can cuz if u have a laptop to do it anytime there no place gotta be at for online school your just at home doing school work on a laptop you on then why not my concern is say you have a question about something and u need to email your teacher how long do u have to wait what if its er gent and also i dont think that many people will do it so cuz there just like that on my behalf i think that if i had online school it would be kinda tricky trying to ask the teacher for help when u need it and it takes a while for the teacher to respond the good thing is not waking up in the morning to get ready for school and i suppose u can do it whenever on that day but complete it so at my school there thinking about going online cuz there this serious virus and there thinking about putting us for online and if we do have online im probably going to be a struggle with trying to get the teacher to answer my questions so my best bet for online is that your basically do school and your just at home with no teacher or students the cool part think is you can do it whatever time of the day you want to. thats what i think about online schools and some students will prob benefit from online schools.
