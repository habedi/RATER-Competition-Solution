Dear, Principal i think that students should be required to perform comminute service because students need to learn how to help other people because life is not all about them people will need their help and maybe some day we need theirs. i also think that kids should do comminute service is because you can always make something fun i have dine it my self for church we had to help clean an old mans house who could no longer do much so we cleaned his backyard and we had fun with it we sang we made jokes with the old man and we did our comminute service its a good experience that you will always remember. i think kids should do comminute service as well because helping our comminute is benefiting you the community and the person your helping it makes you a better person and the comminute a better place and the person you helped no longer needing to do it himself so we would be helping our self. communite is also something kids should do to show that they care about the comminute and they want to be better and they are a role model to other kids an parents. my mom use to say what you do to other will be done to you if you help others today others will help you tomorrow .and being a good helper will bring more and more of those in the future .and with comminute service you can see an notice witch kids are social or not but it will be part of school kids can fid a way to help family maybe aunts uncles and friends every person need held sometime and it can be even just helping with groceries .i think comminute service is something every kid should do.
