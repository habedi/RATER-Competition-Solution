There is no evidence that there is another life form on Mars. The "Face on Mars" has to be a natural landform. If there is ever evidence about aliens on Mars, then maybe it could be aliens who made the face.

People may believe in aliens, but there is no actual evidence of aliens existing. There maybe videos about people saying they saw something in the sky, but we don't know if it's true. We can only go off of what we believe. You may believe in aliens, but someone might think that you're losing it. How could aliens even make a face in the ground? It could just be that many thing hit the ground of Mars, and it turned out to look like a face.

I believe that aliens don't exist, because there is no evidence that aliens live on Mars. The "Face on Mars" is just a natural landform. If you belive in aliens then you're going to think that they made the face. No one can tell you what you belive.
