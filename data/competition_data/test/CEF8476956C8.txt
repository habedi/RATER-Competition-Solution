Once summer break begians, most students feel realived that they do not have to worry about school work till the next school year. However, most teachers make their students complete a summer project to make sure they continue to learn throughout their summer vacation. If there were no summer porjects, sudents would come into the new school almost feeling brain dead from the lack of learning. The summer projects should be teacher designed because they can ensure you the purpose of the project will benefit the students education and if the sudents were to desinged it they would make the projects too easy to avoid challenging themselves.

If the teachers were to design the summer project they will be able to create a project that will cover inforamtion that the studens have learned in the previous year or introduce the inforamtion they will learn the next school year. For example, if an english teacher was to assigne a book project, the studenst would be required to complete reading the book and the project that the teacher designed. The teacher would then be able to teach more indepth and create benefical activites that all the students would be able to relate too after summer break. If the teacher was to make the projects a group project, it gives the students the chance to work thier clabotaion skills with thier classmates during summer break. This will give the studnest a way to always be learning and a way to start off the school year on the right foot.

When it comes to students designing their own summer projects, no student would willing challenge themselves if they had the option to make all their school work easy. From personal experiance, most of my peers always try to get by in school by doing the bare minimum in all their classes. I can understand why when we all have at least seven classes to complete school work for. However, during the summer most students will have pelenty of time to foucus on one summer project and make sure it is done with their best effort. The sudents are given a decent amount of time to acually absorb the information they are learning instead of rushing through every assigment like they would during the school year. If the teachers were to design the projects, they can ensure the student will be challlanged, but they know the students are given more theen enough time to complete the project.

Studets who are asssigned a summer project may be unmotivaed to complete it becuase of their lack of intrest in the topic. If the teachers were to design the summer project the studnets would be limited to what they are allowed to learn though the project, which would make many studnets unexcited to learn. If they students were to design the projects, they would be able to pick a topic that they are acually interested in learning about and would create a sense of modivation. When students find a topic they want to learn about, it makes learning so much more enjoyable, which would make more stuents want to comeple their summer projects. However, there is always the risk of students making their project too simple when they are the ones desging the projets, which would defeats the purpose of the summer projects.

Overall, the students and teachers would benefit the most if the teachers were to design the summer projects. As much as studenst dislike school and the amout of homework they are faced with everynight, these summer projects create a way to make leaning more enjoyable and exciting. The teachers are able to challenge their students in a stress free enviernment. When the students are not under a lot of stress duing their summer, they are able to ratine the inforamtion they are learing insted of putting all their hard work to waste. Summer projects are a great way to ensure the students are stilling learning throughout the summer, but are able to do it at their own pace and helpes make sure each student is prepared for the next school year.
