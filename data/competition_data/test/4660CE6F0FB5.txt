Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME.

Many people argue that students should be aloud to play sports even though they don't have a B average or higher, there are many reasons why I agree with this statement and why I don't.

A couple reasons why students should have a B average or higher in order to play sports are because they should be rewarded if they are doing well in school and keeping up with their grades.

Students need to learn responsibility and they won't learn it if they are able to play sports with a bad grade.

Many students think that they have the privilege to do extra curricular activities no matter what.

That doesn't teach students to be responsible or appreciative.

If students have good grades and do other activities it will make them think that everything in life isn't easy to get and you have to work hard to get what you want.

There are also several reasons why students should be able to play sports with a C average.

One is that kids need to be active for their health and it builds self-esteem.

Students also meet new friends and interact in a way that they never did before.

Some students with a C average don't have as many friends as others students with higher grades and this is because they are unable to play sports for their school and meet new people.

It would be nice if everyone all had great grades but that's not how life works, so a decision has to be made whether or not to let students with a C average participate in after school activities or not.

I have made a decision after evaluating these results and I hope you will agree with me.

I have decided that students should have a B average or higher to participate in after school activities.

I think that it would be best for all students to learn responsibility and learn to appreciate a reward.

I think my decision is a good one and I hope that you feel the same.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
