THE principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy

I think principal should let students talk during lunch and other time cause there people that would want to make calls very important and they cant cause teachers won't let them ..

Another reason principal have reasons cause people be making phone calls to there friends and looking for drama and things like that thought the phone .some times kids take out the phone and school and try to still them from other students or look for fight's for little things like that some kids takes in class and loose what the teacher is saying and put there grades down and make mistakes in there class.

principal do not allow students using there phone in class because they will pay so into the phone and negro what the teacher is saying or for getting all the things i think they should leave it how it is because people make there score more better and get good grades having time during lunch time is the worse thing cause people look for drama in the lunch room and it can cause lot's of thing like fight and things like that.

I don't think people will not listen to turned there phone in class they will turn them on and once the there is turned back they text real fast and put them somewhere where the teacher won't see them .Or pass it to one of there friends so they won't get caught texting in class or somewhere in the bathroom talking to there friends and meeting each other in the bathroom.

and talking about drama and things like that.

STUDENTS be hiding things behind teacher back while they doing all the work in the board like texting and talking in places in the school or hiding there phones in between there laps or inside there books so the teacher won't see it some go to the library to talk on there phones behind the book shell's and opening there books AND TEXTING WHILE THE TEACHER WALKS AWAY from them ?

DO PRINCIPAL HAVE REASONS TO TAKE CELL PHONE FROM STUDENS ?

I THINK THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT CAUSE TEACHER DONT PAY ARE PHONES THEY OTHER REASON IS THAT SOMETIMES THEY SHOULD IF THE KIDS ARNT PAYING ATTION IN THE CLASS.
