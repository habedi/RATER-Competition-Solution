Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continue learning during the break. Should the assignments be student designed or teacher designed. I feel as it should be teacher designed because some people wouldn't know what to come with, It would make it easier because they are more familiar to teacher designed assignments, and most students wouldnt do it because its not teacher designed.

First, most students would feel as it's easier because it's teacher designed and thats what they are familiar to. For example, The teacher gave us students designed projects and we really didn't know what to do. So when the time came for us to turn it in, the class really didn't get a good grade.

Another reason, is some people wouldn't know what to come with. In this movie i've watched the teacher had assigned projects to certain groups and this one group couldn't think of anything. So they went to each others houses and would think about what they should do and before they knew it, it was time for the project to be turned in. The next day had came and the teacher put in the grades they all had zeroes. It could have benefits though because assigning students designed projects it can help them later on in life, they could get a job where they have to do the designing.

Finally, most students wouldn't do it because it wasn't teacher designed and they were being lazy. Since they had to do more work they would be lazy and wouldn't do it. I know other students and including myself, that didn't do an assignment because it wasn't teacher designed and we had to do more work and think more. So most of got zeroes.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continue learning during the break. Should the assignments be student designed or teacher designed. I feel as it should be teacher designed because some people wouldn't know what to come with, It would make it easier because they are more familiar to teacher designed assignments, and most students wouldnt do it because its not teacher designed. Those are my reasons why the summer project shouldn't be student assigned if you have any you should add on.
