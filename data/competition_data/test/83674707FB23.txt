Phones & Driving

During the past few years, phones become very popular in the world. Every generation has a telephone. A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. Phones are taking over the world, and a lot of people are getting addicted to their phones. Knowing that it is dangerous to text and drive, we still do it; 90 % of you agreed to have texted while driving. I'd be lying if I said I had never texted while driving. But I recognize the dangers, and use the alternatives to prevent a car accident. It doesn't matter what commercials we seen, or what car accident we have witness, we still text and drive and it's a fact.

In this generation, texting and driving have been the leading cause of car accidents, especially for teenagers. A lot of teenagers are losing their life cause of texting and driving. Most people think texting and driving are underrated. Some teenagers think that other teenagers that have an accident while texting and driving just don't know how to drive well. So they do it because they think that they can prevent it from happening to them because they can have control of it. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it can help many people to understand what would happen and hopefully teach them a lesson of the consequence when you text and drive. People really need to know and understand how easily it is to take theirs and someone else's life. Texting and driving is a serious hazard, which could ultimately cost you your life or others. This pressing issue needs well thought out ads that will convince people to act on this deadly habit and not just be aware of it.

And most of the time in many cases like this be happening to the age group of 18-25.

Not only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself, many people compare the danger level to drunk driving. Driving while intoxicated at the same time is illegal, just as some believe texting while driving should be as well. Drunk driving is another top cause of car accidents that happen every day. If people were more aware of how closely related texting while driving and drunk driving are, it would help to inform all drivers on safety behind the wheel. All of these hazards on the road are making other drivers very nervous. Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.

It is obvious that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but the majority of drivers continue doing so. Even with all the stories of disastrous car accidents transpiring as a direct outcome of distracted driving, teens and adults are still texting at the wheel. Overall I think a phone shouldn't be allowed in cars while driving. People should put their phones away like in their purse or somewhere it can't cause a distraction to them, because I know for fact that as soon as that phone ring or a notification comes on most people would reach for that phone, and it's at that moment their focus on the driving is lost. If people follow that rule, I think the rate of a car accident would decrease, and people would be alive and well. Today, texting while driving out numbers the amount of drunk driving according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Texting while driving is ten times more likely to cause a big accident than drunk driving. You are 23 times more likely to have an accident if you are texting.

A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. For this reason, many states are making new laws designed to curb such risky habits amongst drivers and enhancing safety on the road for others. In conclusion, texting while driving is a big issue, we are doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others people. Leave the phone alone or at home while you are driving because a text is not worth your life and somebody else's, that text will be there when you done driving or when you get home.
