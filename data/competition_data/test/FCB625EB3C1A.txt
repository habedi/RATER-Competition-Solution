Dear principle,

Community service is a great thing to be a part of, but you shouldn't have to do it if you don't want to. Community service is a great way to better your community. I feel that if you are forced to do it you wont take as much pride in the work that you are doing and the community wont look as good as it could if you actually wanted to be doing it.

Doing community service is great when you decide to do it yourself. There are so many was you can help out with your own community whether it be planting a garden, or to help build a house for someone who's home recently got burned down. But if you don't want to than why should you have to.

I agree that community service should be done more often by people, but those people should be volunteers that want to make there community a better place. Not by people that were forced to do it because their principle made it a requirement.

Community service can be fun. You and a friend can do it and be able to talk and have fun while helping out your own community, but if you just don't want to than no one should be able to force you into doing it.

I highly disagree with making community service a requirement. Yes community service is great like I have already said, but you shouldn't be forced to do it. It should be a personal choice that you make because you really want to make the community that you live in a better place and you know that you can help

Sincerely,
