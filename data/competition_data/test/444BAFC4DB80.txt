All over the world you see people playing football, soccer, basketball, and many more. the reason for this is many people enjoy staying active. No teenager would want to stay home doing nothing but tedious work or chores. It is a fact that 75% of teenagers have an after school activity they do. In school some students are in an average of no higher than a C, but others are highly qualified to get better grades. The C average students are expecting to try their hardest at sport as a backup in a good collage. Relying on your responsibility, dedicating to get better, and succeeding to get into a better college are reasons why principals should allow for all grade average students to play sports.

To begin with, relying on your responsibility is a great highlight in sports. For example, the series of charmed. Three sisters commit themselves to fight for each other and each others lives. Going through harrowing experiences against evil forces they still rely on their responsibility and preserver like hero's to their community. Teenagers will act the same toward their sports. They will try their hardest on their school work, but also on their sports. Therefore, gaining back on your responsibility helps students with their sports.

Moreover, a student dedicating themselves to get better. Historically speaking, when the declaration of independence was taking place in the united states. We had to dedicate ourselves to gain our property from the British. To make everything better we had to go through rough times and allay ourselves back on track. Many students do the same now in present day. No one would like to see one of their students fail at one thing and not trying at the next. Students all over push themselves to do better, don't let them try with out getting something in return.

Additionally, succeeding to get into a better college are main examples. "Rules of the Game" by Amy Tan illustrates determination. This is about a young girl who ends up being a master in chess. She puts all her gut into learning more and more about the strategies in chess. She wants to place herself into a well known tournament and succeed into making herself proud. Many students want to feel happy that they can at least do one type of sport right and get a good scholarship because of it.

In Summation, Relying on their responsibility is one example of what students are meaning to do. They also dedicate themselves to get better and want to succeed to get into better collages. Just because their average is not as high doesn't mean their qualities in a sport are not well. Let them do sport and get a relief out of it, it will make them proud and try harder in school.
