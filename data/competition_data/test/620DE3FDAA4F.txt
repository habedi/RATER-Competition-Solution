By the year 2020 , technology has become a standard in any home, therefor kids have been spending more time indoors playing games then outside, socializing with other people in person than by a screen. Yet there are some benefits to technology, communication ain't one of them. Most kids grow up unaware of how to act in front of older, even younger people in public because of the lack of communication wen they were young. but by supporting them in their younger years to join a after school club, they can learn new skills that can help them once they get older like how to communicate with others, embrace them self in clubs they are passionate about and make new friends along the way.

After school clubs are meant to be social, to interact with the people around you, and to help you relive stress from the prior school day. By going the an afterchool club, you gain confidence to talk to new people around you, loss that anxiety to talk to new people you never meet before and just become more socially active than before. clubs were made for this and by forcing kids to join them, they become more exited to come to school just because they know that after school ends they can go hang out with their friends at the afterschool club they decided to meet at. so by encouraging student to join clubs they become more social, but thats not all an aferschool club can provide to a student in school

Clubs offer valuable skills that can help students in the future in many ways. like fir an example, by joining a athletic club like soccer, kids can discover new talents they never knew they had until now, opens paths in their future to become something better like a professional soccer player, or a good hobbies to maintain because of the good exercise they can archive while playing the sport. Yet other clubs have different tasks in teaching students, like boy scout cub. boy scout provide many skills that become useful in the future, like going on a camping trip. learning to tie a knot become a necessity when camping, Yet dont know how to do it, but you it become second nature because of you taking boy scout in middle school. All clubs have benefits to children, by teaching them something new or by in bracing a natural talent they have. yet there is one thing that is more important than this.

Yes, clubs are meant to be educational and boost your confidence a little, but the real reason to join a club is to have fun!

having fun s great for your physical and emotional self esteem because when you have fun, you forget about all he stress you have accumulated and relax, enjoying the time time you have with friends, remembering all the friends you have me and reliving all that depression you once had because you were alone gone. by having fun in a athletic sport, you exercise having benefits i your emotional self and physical by reducing the chances of childhood obesity. After school clubs are meant to be fun extensions of your life, point in life where all the stress, disappointment and anxiety you have to go away, by spending time with other people in fun ways. Thats the meaning of a afterschool club, to have fun in it.

So,by indulging students to join an after school club, they can receive multiple benefits in there emotional and social life. giving them ways to relive stress than by vaping or taking prohibited drugs like cocaine or anything else. cubs give them opening inwich to relive themselves from stress in school or home. they provide ways to meet new new people that share those interests and a new way for them to learn new thing in life. Thats why i thinks schools should enforce students to join an afterschool club, so they can learn new thing in different ways.
