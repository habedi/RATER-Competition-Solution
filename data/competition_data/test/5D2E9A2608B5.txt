Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

Recently it has been brought to the attention of the student body that you are considering a policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average before they could participate in sports and extracurricular activities. I would like to inform you that this policy change would be a great mistake, and that most members of the student body agree with me.

Many students who want to participate in sports and extracurricular activities work very hard on their homework, listen in class, and try their hardest on tests, still end up with a lower-than-average grade. Even though they have exerted a tremendous effort on achieving a higher grade, they have been given a C for their hard work. This would prevent them from participating in sports, even after all that effort. Is this really a commendable idea? Punishing kids for their efforts? Sometimes, a subject just doesn't make sense to an individual. We were all created with different talents.

Perhaps a star athlete can't join the basketball team this year because he has a C on his report card. What if he could've helped the team make it all the way to a championship? It is a grievous mistake to pass this new policy change, because you are taking away the potential of some great athletes.

Did the best NBA players all have 4.0 GPA's on their report cards when they were in school? I'm guessing many of them didn't. Some of these kids view sports and extracurricular activities as the one thing that they can excel at. Would you take that away from them? I have a friend who has low grades in nearly all of their classes except physical education. I know that they always try their hardest in school, but sometimes a subject just doesn't make sense. These low grades don't have a positive effect on their self esteem. In fact, they feel awful about it. But, that A, the one perfect grade on their below-average report card, makes them take pride in themselves and their achievements. If you take away sports from them, what will they be left with that they can be proud of? Nothing.

I sincerely hope that you will not change the school policy. This would deal a great blow to the student body, and deprive many athletically talented students of a chance to use the gifts God gave them. After all, it says in the Bible that God wants each and every one of us to use our talents to bring forth his kingdom.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
