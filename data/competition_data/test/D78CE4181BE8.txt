I belive the driverless cars are a good idea due to the many reasons I have come to know through reading the passage provided. There are less distractions while driving these cars. Although they are not full driverless cars, they take over most of the driving. It has been shown that with these driverless cars there are fewer wrecks than with our regular cars we are use to driving everyday.

While driving the driverless cars people still have most of the control. When a dangerous or risky situation is approaching the driver is signaled to take control over the car. So the driver does have control during difficult or risky situations. For example like backing out of a driveway or even into one, complicated traffic situations, and even navigating through road work, or accidents. The car only has control in calm situations that may not cause harderous risks.

Millions upon millions of dallars have went into this project not only to manufacture the cars and to make sure they work , but also to fix situations due to the saftey or anything regarding the car. If something is not up to date, or isn't working corectly the engineers are paid to fix it. This causes the driverless cars to be more efficent and safe. Texting and driving is a huge problem with the society we live in today, but if you put thought into it the car can take over driving while you or whoever reply to that text instead of putting peoples lifes at risk. Also, another example would be if your running late and trying to finish getting ready your car could drive while your finishing up.

After reading this passage and inferring some things I have came to the conclusion that driverless cars are not only more convinent but also safer and cause less polution. Driverless cars have had a signifcate difference in wreck numbers than a regular car. As a bonus they give out less polution while driving. Which not only means they're safer for the enviorment, but also safer for peoples lifes.
