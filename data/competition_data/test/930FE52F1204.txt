The limiting of car use can help with many things in our environment and society today.  One reason it could help is all of the gasses gathering up in the atmosphere and damaging crop and other vegettation.  Another reason is giving teens less stress to overcome with all the school work and testing they have to do.  The last reason is less death in the United States and less money spent on car crashes every year possibly pulling us out of debt.  Limiting car usage could possibly save America from drowing in debt.

Gasses gathering in the atomosphere are killing plants and possibly animals on our planet.  The toxic fumes our cars release are killing vegetation and harming crops we need to eat and survive.  Most animals need the plants to eat and care for young, but we're killing those plants leaving the animals to starve killing them off one by one.  The Earth is made with specific gasses in the atmosphere to help protect us from the harmful rays of the Sun.  Without those gasses we would be nothing but a lifeless desert.

Limiting car usage can help save teens from the stresses of everyday life without the worry of learning how to drive.  Teens today are so excitied to drive but none of them want to take the time to learn the rules of driving before getting behind the wheel.  This causes us stress.  Us teens have too much school work and tests to worry about learning how not to take drugs and drink alcohol behind the wheel.  Driving also causes us stress on the road as well.  If we limited car usage we wouldnt have to worry about car crashes or accidents if there were no cars.  Sure we wouldnt have any fast transportation but thats what bikes, trains, and planes are for.

America is in debt.  Thats a fact.  Most of Americas debt comes from car related accidents every year.  Billions of dollars are spent each year replacing, repairing, and financially supporting those involved in crashes.  Without cars, people wouldnt have to worry about if America is going to fall due to the government taxing.  America can survive without cars.  America can be safe and non-costly without cars.  Limiting the usgae of cars can help America live safer happier lives.

Limiting cars in America would help in many ways as i proved to you in my following paragraphs.  Gasses can be preserved where they belong.  Stress can be relieved in teens and adults.  Debt can be relieved and save us.  Limiting car usage can help in those ways.  It can also help in other ways as well.  But, you and the government have to make those decisions for each other.  Limit car usage in America.
