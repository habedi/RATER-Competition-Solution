Dear Principal,

I think that this choice is debatable with either outcome. If I were principle, I would chose Policy 1 because it lets the kids have their free time and not have a big deal towards the issue. One way this Policy helps is that the kids deserve to have some free time to themselves without it being all day everyday and out-of-hand. I also believe that the kids should not be punished by some students who have made this a bad idea. Most kids have Cell phones and love to text and/or call their friends or family. Another reason Policy 1 one should be used, is because the students might need something from home or have a family emergency that the school might not have information on and the only way they can reach the student is by messaging or calling them buy phone.

This Policy can also be brought the wrong way and the kids will bring the phones to class to talk to people instead of working during class time. Then, if you take away the phones completely, there would be no way of communication towards family or friends. This would also bring no social interaction at all with anyone. I believe that these are not situations that would common but they could still happen. If a student gets hurt, the school will be blamed and not the students because they had no way of communicating. This could also lead to the school being sued. I would rather be safe then sorry. So, I choose Policy 1 because I feel that this is one that will bring more happy students and parents. These outcomes might be rare but who knows? Please keep this option in consideration.
