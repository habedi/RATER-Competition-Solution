Dear principal

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school to use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I believe they should do this because if there not doing anything the students using there cell phones isn't going to hurt them. Especially at lunch when there eating or having conversations they should be able to use there phone its not harming themselves or others . Maybe they need to talk to a parent or something serious letting them use there phone would be great just as long as they don't use it in class. They could have family emergency's and everything and them having a phone would be pleasant. Them having it in class is not really bad at all especially when they have teachers watching them a lot im sure they cant call or text anyone while there in the classroom trying to learn. I'm also sure if a student wanted to text in class they could if you tell them not to bring there phone there going to do it anyway no matter what the teacher says.
