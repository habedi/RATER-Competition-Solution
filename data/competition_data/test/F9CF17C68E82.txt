Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be required to take part in community service.

It is a great way to connect yourself with your community and help out others who are less fortunate than you or the environment.

As an eighth grader, I take part in tutoring some of the younger sixth graders at my school.

I think of this as community service because I do not get paid for these actions.

Also, it is community service because I am helping some of the younger children at my school understand what they are learning better.

Some students might not want to take part in the community service at first.

They might be reluctant to try.

After beginning the process, those certain students might realize that by taking part in community service, you can learn more about yourself as well as the environment and others around you.

The students who at first did not want to take part in the community service, might come to realize that they enjoy helping others and from doing so, benefit personally.

An issue with requiring all students to perform in community service is the time commitment.

Some busy students might decide that community service is not worth their time when they could be doing things that directly benefit themselves.

For example, they might rather spend time with their friends than spend time with children in a homeless shelter.

I think it is important that you understand that these students might take more time to convince to take part in your community service than others.

You should not simply tell them to do the community service because they are required to but you should explain to them why it is so important and you have decided to put emphasis on it.

I think that it is important for everyone to take part in making this world a better place.

Community service is one way to get people to contribute to that.

Students should show that they have a say and have their own individual rights.

By helping others or the environment around you, students can show that they can change this world, one little step at a time.

Community service could be that first little step.

I find it very important for all students to take part in community service some time in their life.

I think by making it a requirement for the students that attend our school, everyone will find that community service helps to better understand yourself as well as others.

It is a great opportunity that we should all take advantage of.

Sincerely,

Your student
