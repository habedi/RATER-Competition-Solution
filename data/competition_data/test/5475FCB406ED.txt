Over the course of years new technologies have been inveted to better our life style. there have been inventions like trains,airplanes and boats to better our transportion; however there is one transportion vehicle that has spun up many contriversies. The automobile or "car" as most people call it has spanwed more harm than good; rates of pollution have risen and smog can be found almost anywhere. Limiting the usage of cars should a solution due to the advantegs of reduced pollution, less green house gas and it could even make a person happier!

As most industrial inventions cars do produce tons of smog due to Diesel fuel a chemical found in cars. Smog has been such a issue that the city of paris actully had to enforce a law that would ban cars for a few days. This law was so stressed that any one caught driving would bee fined 22 euros in which converted in dollars would add up to 31 dollars. Paris had more smog than any other european capital; they had about 147 micrograms compared to London on the other hand which only had 79.7. With such high numbers of micrograms the intnsity of the smog worsend causing the extreme idea of baning cars. This example should be a reason on why we should reduce the usage of automoblies so that extreme measures are not acted on; but more importanly the possibility of having pure of cleansed oxygen.

In alliance of having minimum pollution safety is aslo one advantge that reducing driving may enhance according too Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company; stated that the plan of reducing usage of cars did bring a safer world for pedestrians not only does is bring about safety but it does conserve natrual resources like oil that may take hundreds of years to replenish. We need to keep in mine that as inhabitants of earth we must care and vaule every natrual resource. We only have one planet and we must protect it. Reducing driving has been such a triaumph that a mother of two even said "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way" once again this statment only poves that reducing the usage of automobiles is a better life style for all.

All in all reducing driving does bring some great advantges and should really be consider as a plan to make the world a better place. this plan should be acted upon all over the world.
