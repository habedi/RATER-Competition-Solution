Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. First the projects should be student designed, it shows more responsibility, creativity and effort. Second it gives the students' a better experience and shows different aspects of learning. Student designed projects will help the students' when they get older and move on to college and will have to do all of their work on their own.

First, the projects designed by the students show tremendous responsibility, creativity and effort. The student designed projects leave the students to do it on there own; they have to worry about they want to write, what they want to prove or what they need to show. This shows the student responsibility because it's a school project over the summer that they have to complete, which most students will not even attempt to try . They will have to do the project during their own free time. And do a little of it everyday until it's complete. They can't wait last minute to do the project because it will show when they turn the project in and get a bad grade. The project show's creativity, the students or making the project and didn't get a teacher designed project. They have to come up with the whole project by themselves with only a topic to start with. The students need a creative thought process to get the project done, and in a timely manner. The project shows effort by being able to complete it and doing it right the first time, by being able to sit down and do a school project that need's to be done and you're stuck doing it during the summer. It takes a lot of effort to do a project over the summer, which is your biggest break you have off school and the most busy break for some students with sports, traveling with your family and work.

Second, it gives the students' a better experience doing the project themselves and it can show different aspects of learning. It's a better experience doing it themselves because the project has to be complete by them, which is what they will have to do when they go off to college. They are not going to be able to get help from their professors' and the professors' are not going to design projects' for them in college they are going to have to learn to do it on their own. Which is a great learning opportunity for students' because it's not easy doing a project yourself and it takes practice to be able to make a good project. Doing projects can also show you different aspects of learning, By having to look up information for your project, having to do research on your topics for you to be able to complete your project. There might be some things you can't find to finish your project so you have to find valid resources, witnesses or read because you can't find anything you need on the internet, which shows a different aspect of learning because everything is on the internet nowadays.

I believe student designed projects would be a better learning perspective than teacher designed projects. Students have always got assignments by teachers and have to complete them how the teachers want them completed, the projects do over the summer is a different experience there is no teacher there to tell you what to do it's all on the student, his or her views on the subject. The student can use all of the sources they find and put it into one project that wouldn't be like other class mates because they get to write about what they would like too. The teacher assigned project is not a good idea, the students will just copy and paste and can't do anything on their own. The students will have the same information because they all got the same project from the teacher. Therefore student assigned projects or better for both teachers' and students'.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. The student designed projects are a better way for students to learn responsibility, creativity, effort and also help learn different aspects of learning for when they go off too college. Therefore projects over the summer should be student designed and not teacher designed.
