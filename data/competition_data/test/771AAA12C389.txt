Dear senator my opinion of the electoral college is that we should change it to a more popular vote. As stated in the article "under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors " in this electoral college why do voters vote for electors and not for who they directly want voted in. Also what about the disaster factor and voters actually get confused on who they are actually voting for. At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system,in each state candidiates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the states they know they will have the best chance for more votes. Like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see the candididates at all, including Rhode island and South Carolina. The people need a popular vote because they dont want to vote for people who will vote for them they want to vote directly for the person they want to vote for and as everyone refers the electoral college to as an anachronism, a non democratic way of selecting a president that ought to be overruled  by declaring the candidtae who receives the most popular votes the winner. its official the elctoral college is unfair, outdated,and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without mush basis in reality. Cause some people get so confused or angry on who they are voting for they end up not voting or vote for someone completely random they become faithless as they cannot find a solution.
