In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. I am against the development or these cars for many reasons, such as safety, costs, and time.

I am against the development of the driverless cars because of the safety. In paragraph 9, the author states, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultÂ—the driver or the manufacturer?" If a buyer of the driverless car were to get into an accident with the driverless car they would fight that the manufacturer should take fault because they were the ones who created it. Deciding who should take the fault would cost time and money. People should be focusing on the safety of the poor and the people that are dying for reasons that humans have created rather than focusing on funding driverless cars and their safety.

Driverless cars would cost money. in paragraph 6, the author states, "Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars." If just the Radar costs 200 hundred million dollars, imagine all the other sensors that would have to come with the car. Also in paragraph 4 the author states that the driverless cars do indeed need more than just a couple of sensors, "For starters, they need a whole lot of sensors." Sensors are needed to ensure that the driverless cars know where they're going, How the road conditions are, the different speed limits for different states or even countries, and the weather to indicate how fast they should be going. Those are just a few examples of the needs for sensors. Too much sensors costs too much money for the people of the world that have more important needs.

Driverless cars need constant attention at this time and are not completely driverless. The author tells us that the driverless cars are not completely driverless in paragraph 7 stating, "In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless." In paragraph 7 the author says, "This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." Why would people fund driverless cars if we would have to give constant attention as we do to nondriverless cars. it would just be a waste of money watching a car drive itself only in certain situations. In paragraph 9 the author states, "Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times." The manufacturers of the driverless cars would have to go through so many people to change the law and that could take time that they would not have because of the money they have put into this project.

The article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," gives many examples as to why driverless cars are great for the people, but they also give many reasons as to why they should not be funded. I am against the Development of these cars.
