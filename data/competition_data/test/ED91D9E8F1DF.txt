Dear Principal,

There are many advantages and disadvantages to allowing cell phones in school.

I agree with Policy 1.

I think that students should be allowed to bring there cell phones to school and only be allowed to use them during lunch and free periods.

The reason for this is because students will still be able to focus on their school work, will be able to contact a parent if an activity after school is cancelled or scheduled for that day, and they will be able to contact a parent if they don't feel good.

First off, it is very important for students to be able to focus on their school work and not be distracted by a cell phone.

If cell phones were allowed in class, students would be texting the whole class and not paying attention to the teacher's lesson.

Allowing cell phones in lunch and free periods, will not interfere with any students school work.

Kids will be able to focus in class and do all of the worksheets that are assigned without being distracted by a text.

Then, after kids work hard in class, they deserve to use their cell phones in lunch and study halls because they already got their work done.

To add, it is necessary to allow cell phones in school during a free period or lunch because a child may need to contact one of their parents if an after school activity is canceled or scheduled for that day.

For example, a child's basketball game or practice may get cancelled due to the weather, and they need to be able to contact a parent to tell them that they will be taking the bus home.

On the flip side, a child may need to contact their parent to tell them that their basketball game has been scheduled for today and that they won't be home right after school.

If kids weren't allowed to use their cell phone in school to contact their parents, then their parents would be worrying about them because they wouldn't know why they weren't home.

Lastly, a child deserves the right to contact one of their parents if they aren't feeling good.

During a free period or study hall, a student can call their parents to ask them if they can pick them up form school because they aren't feeling right.

If students weren't allowed to call their parents if they weren't feeling good, then they would have to stay in school and suffer through the whole day and maybe even infect other people.

In conclusion, you should pick Policy 1 because students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school and use them during a free period or lunch.

This is necessary because students will still be able to focus on their school work, they will be able to contact a parent if an after school activity has been canceled or rescheduled for that day, and they will be able to contact a parent if they don't feel good.
