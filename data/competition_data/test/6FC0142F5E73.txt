Well what I think should happen, is everybody should help clean up their environment, because people need to know what a clean environment does for other people rather then going somewhere and theirs stuff all over the wall, and what I think a clean environment may help people out in, is the list below.

1. A clean environment can keep people from getting sick.

2. If kids want to go play outside then they don't have to worry about steeping on glass, picking up segerets and seeing how they taste, trying to light it up, picking up food off the ground like gum, candy, and other stuff like that, and parents wont have to worry about their kids going to a dirty school where no one cleans up at and i beat that child's mom will not appreciate that school at all.

3. I'm just saying for an example if we did that's if we did ask someone famous to come to our school do u really think that will happen, they would probably pray for us.

4. Kids need to know how to clean up after them self. Cause I know i have to at home everyday we have chores I even have to cook every 3 times a week.

I don't see why we shouldn't clean up in our area, it's healthy, good for the feature, good for our environment, and people wont look at our school and say, "This school is the worst school I ever saw, and the smell wow I'm so not coming here".
