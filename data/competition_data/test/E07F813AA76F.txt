All young adults should consider participating in "Seagoing Cowboys."

They would most likely like it a lot.

Luke Bomberger certainly did.

"Seagoing Cowboys" is a program where young adults take a boat to Europe.

On the way there, they raise horses, cows, and mules.

When they get there, the cattle are taken to countries who need them.

I wish I was old enough to do that.

The "Seagoing Cowboys" help people in need.

There are millions of people out there who need a horse to eat, or a cow to get milk.

They might need a mule to help carry baskets of food or buckets of water that are too heavy for a single person to lift.

If a person were to join, they could see many unique and interesting places.

They would be very lucky.

A lot of people in the U.S. don't even have enough money to visit sites within our country.

Luke got to visit the Acropolis in Greece, take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, tour a castle in Crete, and even see the Panama canal!

It would also be an incredible experience.

How many people get to raise cattle and sail the Atlantic Ocean at the same time?

You may say that there would be no time for fun, but on the way back they do fun games in the space where the animals were housed.

Some of the games they play include sports, so you would also get exercise.

Some of the games they play are: baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Some might say it is very dangerous at sea.

All you have to do is be extremely careful and you won't get hurt.

If you do, then the other ship members will take extra good care of you.

"What if you go to a place with nothing interesting?" you may ask.

Make it interesting.

Play in a field, run around for a bit, just chat.

The place is only as interesting as you make it.

Look into the "Seagoing Cowboys."

You could have the chance to help people in need, visit cool places, and
