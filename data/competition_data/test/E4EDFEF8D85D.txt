I do like the idea that computers can read our emotions. because it can tell if we are getting bored in a lesson then it could change the lesson like it says in paragraph 6 . I think that would help alots of kids stay focoused and on tastc.

Also i feel like it would make alot of desions much easyer to make because it would know if u like something or not then gve you more options like that one. For examiple when your online shoping or looking for a video game to play.

Somehting eles i think this emotion reading computer can help is when your upset and your on youtube or even socal media it knows your upset so it put stuff on your time line that won't make you even more sad or puts stuff on your timeline that will make you feel better. And that is why i think a computer that can read emotions would be very helpful in veryus ways.
