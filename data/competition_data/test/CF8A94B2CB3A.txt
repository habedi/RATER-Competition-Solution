Talking about exploring Venus can lead us to new experinces and new innovatios. but, there are also risk being taken. Venus is brightest planet next to us. nearly everyone can tell when its Venus or when is a star. Venus is a very small planet however; it has a very large amout of air pressure and a very large amount of carbon dioxied. not just that it also contains extreme heat temperatures.

Author states that is a very high risk discovering Venus, the author says "tempertures woulld still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit." "air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth." Now according to the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is says that a NASA is going to have to send a person and in a type of ship that would flot above the Venus. however; Venus has a blanket type layer on its atmosphere which would only limit the researchers. "Researchs cannot take samples of rock, gas or anything from a distance. therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorouh mission to understand Venus would need a up close and personal despite the risk." What this piece of evidence is saying is that from a far view nothing can be really done, this would require a upclose and more personal experice.

A mission that would require those types of standards would maybe cause a lot of damage to a human being. Venus is mostly composed of carbon dioxied, 95%, and is air pressure is extreme, 90x, let not talk about Venus temperatures, 800 degrees. The passage also says "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to laste long enought to contrivutr meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus" NASA clams that they are other people in their enviorment that are looking for new ways to get a upclose of Venus. In paragraph 7 says that NASA will be using "simplified electronics made of silicon and carbid" they claim that has been tested in chamber that acts like Venus choas.

All of this reaseach can lead us to new experinces and new discoveries, however; this is really high risk that NASA is taking. Venus can do stuff unexpected and maybe lead this into major disaster. NASA also states that they have other people using old technology to go to Venus and explore. WWII is he type of technology that they are using to explore on to the bright planet. The thing that those other computers have or technology is that they are bigger and stronger "systems that use mechanical parts can be made resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."
