Distance learning isnÃÂ´t a very good program in my eyes. For instance, people will not be able to meet new friends, wifi errors could occur, and problem with the audio and video could occur as well. In some cases, having all of these happen to a person trying to get their education could potentially have them miss something important. People would want to do this program for great benefits, but unfortunately there are many risks of doing so.

If someone is doing long distance learning programs they wonÃÂ´t be socialized with other students. For some people they might find this relieving, but this could effect the way they react to the public. Normally when someone is used to being home all of the time and not going out causes them to want to stay home. If someone is home all of the time and they finally go to the public, theyÃÂ´re antisocial and awkward around other people. Students doing this program wouldnÃÂ´t be able to make new friends. These students would also have to learn to socialize with new people that they meet. In most peopleÃÂ´s lives it is important for them to meet new friends, go out, learn new things about the world. Having a teenager or young adult in this program could cause them to become a home body. They would always want to stay home, not talk to friends, canÃÂ´t meet new people, and they would just be antisocial all around.

Another example of why distance learning is a bad idea is that there is always a chance of error. For the video and audio calls it could potentially cut out for a moment, and the student could miss something very important that they need to know. For instance, if the class were going over directions of how to do a certain assignment while the video or audio cuts off, then the student doing long distance would have missed how to do it. ItÃÂ´s never good to miss something in class that you absolutely need to know. Even if the video goes out, the audio could still work. But if the audio goes out, then there is a very high risk of someone missing important instruction.

There are always errors to come with the internet. LetÃÂ´s say that class is in session and the student doing long distance has poor internet connection. The internet could fail for a few minutes if not longer, and while it is trying ti get fixed class is still going. This student could miss out on a very important assignment, or instructions they needed to know for a test, project, poster, etc. If that were to happen, the teacher most likely isnÃÂ´t going to stop for them to get reconnected. That means that the student would have to back track and ask the teacher what was missed while this error occurred.

On the other hand, this program could be beneficial to those students who are home bound. They would be in a comfortable place, get to see their friends, and also get their education. Unfortunately, there are so many things that could go wrong with this program. All of the reasons talked about above; are very likely to happen to someone doing long distance learning programs.

So in the end, it is best fir us to just do away with long distance learning programs. It would be best for all student education and for their sake of socializing. This program puts people at missing assignments, missing out on great people to meet, and more so missing out on life.
