I don't like the proposal that the principal is making. To require students to have at least a B to play sports is unbelievable. In some cases people who mentally can't get a B are discriminated against, C is a passing grade although not a good one to have, and you could suddenly have a really hard lesson which brings your letter grade down.

There are students out there that find it is impossible for them mentally to get a B. They could have a ADHD which causes them to get really distracted and they aren't able to pay attention.

Also, they could be autistic where they find the easiest thing the hardest. Such as, calling 911 or other simple activities. I have two cousins that are autistic and I know how hard it is for them to learn and fit in. This rule is unfair to them.

Also, a C is considered a passing grade. Although your parents might not approve of it, it will get you into the next grade. So why make it so that people that are passing in school should have to work harder to just get a better passing grade. It all just adds up to more work and more time spent on studies. Students need to also get a decent amount of exercise and this isn't provided to us if we are inside learning 24/7.

The school has many courses to teach you throughout the year and some will be harder than others. You could find that when you have a B you suddenly have a C. This could be because the subject that you are being taught is much harder than ones that you have done throughout the year. For example, My Spanish teacher predicted that are letter grade would drop on the subject we where learning. She said that this subject was the hardest thing we would be learning all year.

To say the least, I feel that we, as students, have the right to play sports as long as we are passing. The rule that the principal proposes would make me and a lot of other people unhappy. I hope that you do
