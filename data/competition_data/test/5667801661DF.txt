The face as you call it is just a natural land formation. We took pictures that prove us correct but you still think it was created by aliens. All we saw was that it was a mesa and that its shaddows look like a face. So why dont you belive us if you lok colsely at the 1998 picture you can clearly see no alien markings but yet you still belive why. Every body else belives us why cant you all you we see is a big rock so why do you think aliens put it there.

In the article it clearly states that the so called face was not made by aliens but just natural formations. There is no life what so ever on mars. It was not made by aliens but instead by mother nature. It was found in cydonia where a lot of other mesas located there and if that is not proof enough we sent three misions and they all reported it was a mesa nothing more nothing less. Unfortunatly some scientists belived it was an alien artifact so we took more pictures and the showed the exact same thing.

But we sent another mission to take pictures with more pixels and they showed no proof of alien life. But you still dont belive us and I dont understand why you dont belive us. even though we gave you all this proof you dont seem to care. What will it take to convince you that its not a face. If I were you i would have belived NASA as soon as they showed the picture.

But I am not you so

I will try to convince you. But if you reject the idea I will not care.

I will simply leave . So I will. continue when they told the public they even said it was a natural thing but still . the face is not really made by aliens but it is naturaly awsome. so i will leave telling you that you are wrong and that NASA is right. but the face is still cool and if it broke off and fell to earth it would be alien so food for thought.

I think you might be right about one thing the face is so cool. and i think that you are mostly wrong bye
