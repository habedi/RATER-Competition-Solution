With the help of technology, society now has a great invention called online school. Online school is another way for students to get their education but with a twist, being in the comfort of their home. It's like home school but with a computer. Students who choose to enroll will make higher marks, have better mental health, and have more free time.

Students who choose to take online school will benefit with better grades. Online schools give students the opportunity to choose what time they would like to begin learning. Students wouldn't be forced to wake up at a certain time to attend sessions like public and private schools. One can just log on and start learning or working on assignments as they desire. Along with choosing when they want to wake up, students also get the freedom of choosing how long they would like to study. There is no set time of instruction, students can just hop online and if they're lacking concentration they can just log out and sign back in as they desire without a teacher constantly yelling at them to focus. Although some students may abuse the power and study a few amount of hours or days, they still won't be penalized for being absent and will still be able to catch up without "getting behind" other students because the classes consist of just that one student and a computer. The student can and will benefit from these advantages and in return get good grades.

Along with benefiting with good grades, online schools will help students' mental health as well. Many students who have bad mental health often have a lot of absences from school. Online school will help students learn in the comfort of their own home and won't give them a chance to be absent. Also, students who face social anxiety will be able to learn without the stress of being in a public space with multiple other people. Even though some may say that going out helps those with bad mental health and social anxiety, going to a public space surrounded with many people especially in a place where you have to learn is not ideal. The idea of education is for the minds of people to get educated, not to make them uncomfortable. With the help of online school, students will be excelling while being in a comfortable space.

What these new generations lack is some free time. Students enrolled in online school will have access to do more things they desire with their own schedule. Most schools take up at least 7 hours of a students day. Having to sleeping for 9 hours and then having to attend 7 hours of school leaves students only 8 hours to themselves. In these eight hours they also have responsibilities such as chores at home, spending time with their family, and completing the excessive amount of homework teachers give. With online school, student get their education while still having the opportunity to get a job, join a sport, join the gym, etc; Despite the fact that some students still have a job, are involved in a sport, or go to the gym while being in public or private schools, students in online school still get the benefit of making their own school schedule that accommodates to their personal life. Students who enroll in online school will be able to have more free time where they can do whatever they desire without having school be in the way.

As a child, you're often told "your childhood years will be best years of your life" but it feels as if students these days don't get to experience that childhood that older generations once had due to the advancements in the education system which includes the excessive amount of work students are given and the expectation of having to go to a good college in order to make it somewhere in life. With the help of online school more students will have higher grades, good mental health, and access to more free time, all while making their childhood years worthwhile.
