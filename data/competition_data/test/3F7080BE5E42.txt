Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly believe you should require all of the students at our school to have a certain amount of time of community service. I believe this because helping out others in our community will help everyone. When my family and I go to the homeless shelter and serve we all leave being thankful for everything we have and who we are.

I also, serve at my church every Sunday. Volunteering and helping others gives me a warm feeling in my heart. Everyone needs that warm feeling and if all of us students had to do at least one or two hours a month it would help our community look better, be a safer place to live and be a great life lesson.

Some students already serve their community weekly or monthly, but to the ones who don't and think that it will just take away there time they are the kids that need this the most. I have seen community service change people it not only changes the people serving but the people who they are getting to help as well. If someone was to just help out one younger kid with their homework it would change the kid's out look on others and want to be like the big kids. But, if no one would help the kid out and be a good example then they would most likely follow in the foot steps of a person who didn't care about anything at all. Then, they wont care about how they appear to others and just not be interested in the world.

If we want to live in a great big happy and peaceful world we need to take the first step and start changing for the better and that is why I believe that everyone should be required to have a certain amount of time doing community service. That is what we want right? World Peace.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
