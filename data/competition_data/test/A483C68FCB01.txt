I believe that this technology that can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vaulabe. I believe it is vaulable because it can know when the student is either happy,sad, or bored. When the computer finds out your emotions then it can help you with your work depending on how you are felling.

First, this software can identify all your emotions. This technology is vaulable in the classroom because when it known rather you are mad , happy, etc. it can produce ads depending on the expressions it sees you are having. In paragraph 6 it says,"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad . For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. " This says that the computer will changes the things on your screen depending on your emotional expressions. The computer can also detect if the student is getting confused or bored which happens to many students when they are working or the computer or in class. This shows that if the student is getting confused, then the computer can try and explain it better or demonstrate the work better.

Last, I believe that the technology that Prof. Thomas Huang has invented can help students in the classroom. The technology is very vaulable in the classroom because it can modify the lesson like a effective human instructor. "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang. " So computers need to understand that too."
