Venus is sometimes called the "Evening Star" when it is no star at all. Venus is a planet right next to Earth. The author provides examples of the advantages of exploring Venus such as getting a better understanding of Venus, its the closest planet to Earth, and its the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author believes a worthy pursuit is to study Venus despite the dangers it poses.

First of all, exploring Venus would give us a better understanding of this planet and why it is important we study it. On the planet surface of Venus the tempertures average over 800 degrees, and because of the dense atmosphere most forms of light cannot be penetrated. In the article it states, "If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astromomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." With the author adding this in his article it proves that studying Venus could benefit the human race in the long run.

Second of all, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. This gives Earth advantages of being able to send out a spacecraft to land on Venus. The article says, "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too, Eath, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world." With this in the article it shows that being able to send out spacecraft to Venus expands the curiosity and imagination of scientists wanting to explore Venus.

Finally, Venus is the most Earth- like planet in the solar system. In the artice it describes, "Long ago, Venus was provably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Eath. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." This proves that Venus could of been just like Earth today.

In conclusion, the authors suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despute the dangers it presents. The author gives us evidence of why its important such as, we would expand our understanding of Venus, it is the closest planet to Earth, and its the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. There is no garantee that the study of Venus will continue, but there are many reasons why it should.
