Summer break is the time for students to relax and enjoy themselves without the stress to complete work and assignments, but the time might also lead them to forget what was taught to them. During summer break, students will forget what was taught to them in the the school year with no assignments, homework, and projects; and students will rarely ever care to do work themselves. Teachers should design summer projects to students. Projects should be designed by teachers because they know what students struggle on and what appeals to them, they know what students will face in their next year of school, and if students were given the choice to create their own project they will be lazy and sloppy with it.

However, a common argument against this idea is that students will make a project that interests them and will benefit them more. A teacher might not know what the student likes and needs to focus on whereas the student will know exactly what they want. To chalenge this idea, students likely not care due to it being summer break, and teachers who have worked with students can know their flaws and weaknesses that a student might not know about themselves. Due to this reason, students should not be the ones who determine how they design their summer project.

Teachers should design the projects because the teachers will know what can appeal and help a student. A student may not know where they struggle and will have a hard time to create a project that they need to complete. Teachers would have worked with students and know where they should focus on and what that student might like. Therefor, Teachers should design a summer project that can help students.

Teachers will know what things rising students will work and struggle on where students cannot. When students go to the next grade, they might not know what they will be working with and how to do it. Teachers will know what classes a student will take and can create a project that will chalenge and help prepare the student to what they might face in school. Teachers have also worked with the students and know where their weakpoints are and can design the project that can strengthen them in that area. That is why having teachers design the work will help the student in the future.

Teachers should design the tasks and projects for students because students can be lazy and sloppy with their project. If a student were to create their own project, they might not care much for it and not do it well or not even do it at all. In the summer, students will most likely be "too" preocupied with friends, fun, and maybe a job if they work; when a student feels that they are "too" busy they might put off the work, complete it very sloppily, or complete it too fast. Consequently, teachers should the the designers of the summer projects to students due to some students lazy or careless habits.

Teachers should be the determining factor for creating students' summer projects because teachers know what appeals to a student's interests and struggles, teachers can design the projects to prepare students for their next year of school, and teachers will not be lazy or sloppy when it comes to designing summer projects unlike some students. Therefor, teachers should be the ones to design a project for students to complete over the summer.
