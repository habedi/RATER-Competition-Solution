When Dr. paul Eckman decied to create a sofware that can tell you emotions called the Facial Action Coding System it identifys human emotions. It has to have a human structure to apear emotion. The use of the technology is intruding into people personal emotion such as getting on the computer the computer shows your emotion on the screen. In some cases the new sofware can save lifes such as kids that are very depress that just want someone to talk to. There surent tails people have to tell a emotion some picture show emotion very differently then others how can a computer jusfiy the emotion on human that feels all types of emotion more effectly then the next human sitting next him/her. It states in the article "Your frontails pars lateralis ,uscle ( Above your eye)." The saying just making everybody look like they have the same muscle shape when it comes to emotion, majority of the people don't have a normal face structer. The use of technology should not be allowed to be used at all it will be intruding into peopel bussiness and thoughts. If the human society want to show there emotional then the new technology shoul wait until the humans want to allow them to look at there emotions. In the last paragraphs they was talking about the acing crew of acting a serent emotion to the show the muscle movement in the face. Then had them reproduce it on stage, the new technolgy is very smart but yet they only lookin at it as good day they not looking at it in everybody eyes people could feel like they are test subjects based on emotion, that was told to them through a devis that looked at there facial muscle.
