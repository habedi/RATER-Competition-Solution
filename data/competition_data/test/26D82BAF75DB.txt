Letting teachers design the project is the most ignorant design ever. Most students would hate to do a teacher design project. The projects should definitely be student design. I strongly believe a summer project is an intelligent way of letting students retain the information. However it should be student design because they'd be more likely to do it, they'd understand the project more, and it gives them responsibility.

Firstly, students would be more likely to participate in a student-designed project. A whole of of students won't be pleased doing a summer project, so the least schools could do is let the students design the project. Also some teachers make projects way too boring. So if the students design the project it'd probably be less boring for them. It'd be much better to let the students could be as creative as they want. When people find something boring they won't do it, especially young people. So letting the students design the project would increase the chances of the student passing the project.

Secondly, the students would understand the project more. Some teachers make extremely confusing rubrics for the project. When teachers make confusing rubrics it causes a negative reaction to the students trying to complete the project. Some students would lose confidence in themselves on the project, which will increase their chances of failing. That would be a horrible start to the new school year. The goal is for students to pass not fail, and teacher design projects would really increase failing chances. Students will have a hard time passing something they don't understand, because like I said earlier; some teachers make really confusing project-designs.

Lastly, is it gives the students more responsibility. Responsibility is one of the most important things a young person can learn. It helps with maturity & being a better adult. So the student would be responsible for the project & designing it. I know it's very little responsibility, however it does help.

Projects should definitely be student designed. Student design projects teaches students more responsibility. Also it would make students more likely to complete the project. If schools do make summer projects, I hope that they are student designed.
