In this prompt I will be writing an argumentive essay about comparing the two ideas from the story i read ''Un masking the face on mars". The two two sides of this argument is wether the face isthink it is alien remains or natural landform. I personly think it is just an natural landform.

Why i think it is a natural landform is because there is no other sins of life so if there was aliens on mars why would they left a big face carved on a rick insted of something more alien like. Also like Garvin said the face also is very simular to a butte or mesa and the hase details are probly just weird shaperd errosion patterns that over time have come to look like the modern human face.

The face could also posibley be an alien artifact for more specsece to find. Much resuch has been done on mars to see if other human life is on it due to its closeness to the goldy locks zone withc is a obital zone that human life could potetionly live in like earth for example. The NASA teams have even found frozen water on Mars and that is one of the basic needs for animals considering we are over 70 percent water.

It is much more likly the face is just a natural land form though because of how much the size and shape resemple a butte or mesa from the mid west. Plus they're is more then one formation lik this this happens to be the only one is the shape of a htman face. You also have to consider they're is many natural formations who look like other thingd on earth.

In conclution It is a likly chance that the face is nothing more or less then a natural land form who happens to look like the modern humsn face, but we should not dought becuase no one knows for certain.
