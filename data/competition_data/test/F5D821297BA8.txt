In the challenge of exploring Venus, some times called the evening star is one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Exploring Venus it can be dangerous because of it's temperature and because of what can happen to you.

Exploring Venus can be worthy bacuse scientist say that it well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have suppported various formsof life, just like Earth." Venus it can also be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. But it can be a little dangerous because Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system. One of the challenges Venus has are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

The average of the temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric preassure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth, it has rocky sediment and inludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Scientis belive that Venus could have been once a planet where people could live. Scientist also say that Venus could be dangerous in some ways because of it's temperatures.

In the chalange of exploring Venus, sometimes called the "Evening Star" it can be nother planet where humans can live. But venaus can be dangerous, but it also has alot of features like Earth. The temperatures for venus are a little dangerous, because venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system. NASA it's also working on other approaches to studying Venus. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
