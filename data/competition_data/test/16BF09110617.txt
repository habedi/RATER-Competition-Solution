Is using a computer that reads people emotion called Facial Action Coding should be used of students in class. I Think IT should to show if the student is going trough some hard times and may need some help.

Onereason is that students dont know how to handle things thy can get caught up in soem things that can effect them long term. Some student may come to school and get bullyed and they might not know how to handle something like that and wind up getting hurt because they wont speak up. In stead of talking to a teacher about it they get in to fights and no one will want to hire them and they wind up on the streets with no jod.

Another reason is that people may have trouble with money at home and it would help to talk to them about that because they might try to steal and get arrested for it and wind up in jail when they could have better things to do. there dad might be a drunk and beat him when he is drunk so using this machine we could see the proublems they have and help them with it.

One last reason is people need to get out and see the world and find new things. you never know they might like what they see and want to find a job like this one reading people emotione.

In concultion it is good to have some thing to read people emothins so we know whats going on in there life. You never know it might save someones life.
