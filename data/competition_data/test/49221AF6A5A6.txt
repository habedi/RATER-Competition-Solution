I think we should keep the Electoral College. long time ago our founding fathers established it in the consitution . so why change it now ? the Electoral College process consists of the selections of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress . The Electorl College consists of 538 electors . A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president .

on the 32rd of the constitution it said the District of columbia is allocated 3 ellectors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College .

we been doing this for years and my opionion is we shodnt change it.... under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. in each party , selects a slatee of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and the trust is rarely betrayed . did you know barack obama won beeing president because of the electoral college popular vote .

The Electoral College aviods the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast . yeah Electoral college have some problems but it doesnt mean you should take it down . you can fix the poblem easily ! in my opionion it can help people with there elctions and also the election by popular vote for the president of the united states .
