An important part of a child's learning is the time between school years. This time is usually spent down by the beach, or in the mountains. But, for some schools this time is used for projects; projects usually are a serious, mid-late-year rush to get a high weighted grade in before the year is over. Schools that require Summer projects need to switch to student designed projects. Students will have more interest in their projects if they deigned them. This Interest would make learning new things much more fun and exciting for students. If teachers deigned the projects, it would be a generic project with stiff guidelines.

When students have the choice to choose, then more will do well compared to a teacher generated project. Students know what they like, letting them pick would let them dive deeper into a subject they like. Students don't like being confined with very few choices of what to do, this eliminates that factor by giving them a sense of freedom of choice. The purpose of the project is to let the students learn during summer, learning is easier when there is interest in a subject. If the students chooses then they are more likely to enjoy the project.

Without constricting guidelines students could express themselves in new ways through their project. For example, a song, dance, modal of what they researched, or maybe an interview with an expert in that field. Having fun is an important part of this project. The fun in the project spurs the student to learn more for the project and with luck, continue to research and look up facts own their own, without the need of a project to guide them forwards.

Teachers are incapable of filling the need of unique projects for each student. When assigning projects, they assign a single topic that can be worked on, and with strict guidelines on how the project must be completed. This formula usually ends with frustration on both parties as the students are unhappy at the constraints placed upon them, and the teacher is unhappy as they become apparent to the fact that they can't conform to every students needs without spending all of their time or making other students upset.

A student is always willing to do more work if the student enjoys the work. Having the students deign the project that fits their needs individually, rather than a one-project-fits-all, teachers will not have any more work than before, students will enjoy their projects more, and project scores will rise.
