I think that the Facial face Coding System is a good thing because it can tell other peoples emotions. Also not everyone will have the same emotion. Another reason would be that the face scanner wouldnt mess up because it gets all of your face bones. Their is a doctor who studies all the basic emotions what are called happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear and sadness and the doctor who descovered these are Dr. Paul Eckman and they all had charcterastics movements such as your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when your suprised. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. We always perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look of their face. Meanwhile muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows feet around your eyes. According to the faial feedback Theory of Emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Some of this may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!
