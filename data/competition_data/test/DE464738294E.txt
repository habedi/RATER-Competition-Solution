Should students have to participate in extracurricular activities? I say that students should participate in an activity because they can make new friends, find a new hobby they enjoy, and maybe find what career they might like. First, students could go outside of their friend group and make new friends to spend their time with. Second, kids can become more active and healthy. Lastly, students can find what career they might be interested in. In conclusion, after school activities are good for students to grow in friendship, mentality, and physicality.

First, students could go outside of their friend group and make new friends to spend their time with. Some kids may not have friends in their activity, so giving them a friend could make them feel good. Making new friends can also help become more social and friendly. For example, I played volleyball this season and I made friends with people who use to scare me, now they have taught me to be a better player and friend. All in all, students can make new friends that can encourage and boost each other up during their activity.

Second, kids can become more active and healthy from extracurricular activities. Students are able to play sports and stay in shape. For example, I used to be very unhealthy, but then I joined volleyball and I became very athletic and healthy. Although, you do not have to play a sport, you could join a choir to work on your breathing and your lungs. After school activities keep students in a very healthy state.

Lastly, students can find what career they might be interested in from doing an extracurricular activity. If students have a passion there might be an activity where they can learn more about it. Likewise, I want to be in the medical field, so I am volunteering at my local hospital. Similarly, if you want to do online design you might join the yearbook staff. Extracurricular activities can help students find what they really want to pursue in life.

In conclusion, after school activities are good for students to grow in friendship, mentality, and physicality. While doing activities students become better people and peers. Finally, students are able to step out of their comfort zone and do something they may have never known they liked.
