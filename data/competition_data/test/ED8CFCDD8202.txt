The FACS( Facial

Action Coding System) is a computer software that can scan the muslces of someones face and tell the emotions that person is feeling. The FACS seems like a very useless peice of software.

In the article, you read about how they used this software to "decode" the face of the Mona Lisa. The software was said to have worked and was able to tell the emotions she was feeling that very day. She was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Using this type of software on students in class will be useless and also a waste of time. Decoding the face of a student in class wont change anything in the class room. Paragraph six, line six, the author is telling how we can use the software to tell when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and is able to modify the lesson for the that student. Using this software would only be effeciant to those who learn on computers. A teacher could not use this software on a big class full of students because she would get differnt emotions from many different students. The teacher would not be able to give a lesson for just a couple of students in class based on the FACS

The FACS( Facial Action Coding System) would be useless for students. Online schooling could use this software but students in a class room would make the software useless
