Hi my name is Luke and I am going to be telling you some interesting parts about the Seagoing Cowboys program that might convince you to become a of it soon.

One interesting part that I liked about it was the cattle-boat trips I went on. On the cattle-boat trips I helped watched the animals so they were fed and healthy. I was also a part of helping many people and animals. Maybe you would like to be a part in that.

My favorite part about the whole thing was I got to see many interesting places and famous sites. I got to go to Venice,Italy to see the streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete. That was amazing! I also saw the Panama Canal on my way to China. I bet you would love to see some interesting historical sites that you might possibly share with some people.

If some of you like fun games like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whitting you would sure love to become one of the cowboys. Me and all of the other cowboys played these games after the animals were unloaded from the ship. We played where they stayed at. It was a fun time!

It wasn't just an adventure for me it opened up the world to me. I was grateful for this opportunity. I hope you will be too. If you loved what you heard then please become one of the Seagoing Cowboys soon!
