Based on the infomation that I was given,I know that there are reasons to join the program. Those reasons are/is because it could be a oppurtunity of a lifetime or maybe you wanted to watch horses,that would be the place to go,or to have many trips than other Seagoing Cowboys. Some of Luke's claims are getting to have nine trips,feeding the horses and toured the excavated castle in Crete and maravled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. He also got to cross the Alantic Ocean. Also for his second trip he got to be watchmen. he couldnt work for a couple of days beacuse he cracked his ribs. He also enjoys when he can play table tennis ,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and other game to do in the past time. He also got to play baseball and volleyballl with other cowboys/his friends. When Luke said "yes" it opened up the world for him. It made him more aware for people and there country. Luke says " I am glad I had this oppurtunity to help people. What I'm trying to say is open up to school sports,activies that you either like or want to try out for.
