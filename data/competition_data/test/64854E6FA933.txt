In this article they are talking about emotional are getting describe by computers. They are able to know when you're happy, sad, anger, disqust, fear and sadness. They can tell your emotion by your movements of the facial muscles you rises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your ordbicularis oris around your mouth tighten your lips to show anger. One thing that technology is doing that i think is super cool because they are using technology to read students. I think its a great idea because maybe the students doesnt understand the computer and it can explain its self and i also thinks its a good ideal beacause what if the students was bored and it could make it more fun for the students. i think this would be pretty cool because if the students is having a bad day the computer would cheer them up and put a smile on their faces.

This is a great ideal because say if the students is coming confused or bored it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. the same technolody can make computer - animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes some comuper need to understand that, too

It's also a good ideal for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking on her his or her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried ect. Haveing a computer that understand how they feel will make them feel better and at least they know their is something that understand how they feel.

Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly) .Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movement in a real face or in the painted face by weighting the different unit, the software can even identify mixed emotion this should that some kids might not like the computer even though it's understand how they feel.

conculsion It's mostly trying to let the students know that they understand how they feel sometimes and they know the students not gonna talk to their friends or teacher about it so they want to bring computer even though you can't talk to them but they want the students to know that the computer understand and try to cheer them up.
