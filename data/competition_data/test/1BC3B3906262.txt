Think back to a time during the summer, you finally get a break from school, you can relax and do whatever you usually do in your leisure time, but you remember that you have an uninteresting, unwanted, summer project assigned by your teacher that is due in the new school year. Any student can say that they've had a summer project that they rather just not do, yet they have to face the fact that at some point they will have to get over not wanting to do it and push themselves to get it done anyway. Some people may say that summer projects designed by teachers are more affective on the students due to the teacher displaying their style of lesson plans and how they like to teach their students new material depending on the specific lesson. However, I think they are wrong because ifÂ students are able to design their own summer projects, they will be more engaged with the topic it's centered around, they will be able to compromise on a learning style for the project that suits them the most, and the amount of students who turn their projects in on time, fully completed, will increase drastically.

Student-designed summer projects will ensure that students will be more engaged with the project and what they are learning. It is known that if you allow students to give their input on how they would like a certain, assignment, project, or lesson to be created for them, they will end up being more engaged with whatever the specific form of learning may be. The ideas from the students will circle around and bounce off the walls until the most attractive ideas for the assignment, lesson, or in this case project, have been surfaced. Students also enjoy swapping the roles of teacher and student because it allows the student to ensure they will recieve a good grade, enjoy doing the project, and comprehend what they are learning in the best way. Some people may say that students should be able to adapt to whatever way teacher presents a topic of learning and a project to you. However, they are wrong because the way a teacher designs a project can be challenging and take the student a decent amount of time to comprehend how a teacher specifically wants a project done. In conclusion, allowing a student to design their own summer project will raise the chances of a student being fully engaged with the topic of learning and the project.

Student-designed summer projects also come with the benefit of being able to compromise on a specific learning style for the project that will best suit all of the students that have to do it. An example would be that some students learn best visually, they like to have things taught to them shown through diagrams and pictures, so that they can invisualize the topic at hand. The learning style that fits the student the best will display how well they do on the project because of them being able to comprehend it better. I have experienced seeing students ask teachers to explain the topic that they are learning in a different way from what the teacher explained it to them, so that the information could mentally mesh within their brain. Sometimes it takes a certain approach for a student to understand what they are learning and it takes a learning style that best suits them to do that. Some people may say that students don't always have a choice in the learning style a teacher chooses to teach them in. However, they are wrong because students will express to teachers that the information given to them needs to be in a form that best mimics their personal learning style. In conclusion, a student-designed summer project benefits the student by being able to learn the way that suits them best while being away from school, at home, using their specific learning style.

Student designed summer projects will increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time drastically. A summer project given to a student that does not interest them will cause a student to procrastinate, miss the deadline and have to turn it in late, or just not turn it in at all due to the fact that it is summer and most students aren't very concerned with school work. The project must sincerely gain the excitement of the students so that the project will get completed and turned in on time. If students are able to design the specifics of the project the completion and turning in of the project would decrease overall. For example, from my experience of having summer projects I myself, and other students that I know, have waited until the last minute to do a summer project because of the way the teacher designed it for us. Students are the best people to design projects for what they may be learning because they know what they like and the best ways to instill what they are learning in their brains. Some people may say that students completing their summer projects and turning them in on time depends on the students' skill of time-management. However, they are wrong because time-management wouldn't play a factor in a student-designed project due to the project being designed by themselves, which would ultimately encourage them to do it. In conclusion a student-designed summer project would increase the amount of comepleted and turned in projects allowing the students to have their input in it.

I believe that if students are able to design their own summer projects the students will be more enganged in the project, compromise on a learning style that suits them the best for the project, and increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time. Students will have a better understanding of what needs to be done for the project and set a specific criteria. Students will be able to not only get done, but enjoy their project will completing it over the summer. The project will not be catered to one style of learning, to the vast majority of students. Also, students designing their summer projects will motivate them to finish the project on time due their incorporation of ideas.
