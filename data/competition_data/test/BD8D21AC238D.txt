Today I'm going to talk about how some schools prefer attending school online is a good idea for most students.

"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend school from home?" the author asked.

I think that students are going to benefit in many different ways like if the student was sick than he can attend classes from his bed with out going to school and infect others with the virus.

This also help handicap people from coming to school they can just access classes from home without any difficulty.

The Idea of attending school from online by watching video and take notes help a lot of students who are out of state or working at school nights and weak up late to school they can just access the class from home when they weak up with no rush.

This also help the student to finish all classes faster then a normal school day.

For student who travel to visit family during the school season could also access classes from their home at any time they're available at.

Every thing has a negative effect so for the idea of attending school from every where.

Some student who have difficulties of understanding videos face a lot of problems and don't understand anything from the lesson, but there is a solution to this and that is to hire an online live teachers that are able to reply to everything fast.

Also to reduce the pressure of the questions on teachers they should also make a virtual machine that could answer simple questions to students.

With this being said student would learn better and easier because this help the student to gather more information from teachers.

Schools that offer distance learning should also make an online brain storming after finishing lessons this help the students to gather and maintain more information about the lesson they're learning about.

Another way that schools should do to help the student is to provide them some extra practice questions after they complete a lesson so just like a small quiz and if they do poorly the result should show him what to focus on more.

After the student comes back to school the teacher should ask him if he has any questions from the lesson he completed.

So what if the attending school from online is not beneficial for students? What would be the negative effects of it? what should schools do to prevent the negative effects of it?

Well Attending school from online is always beneficial and that also leads our society to the future and there is going to be a lot of effects in both negative and positive way.

To get rid of the negative effects schools need to focus on the cause of the problem and figure a solution for it and after couple of years all schools are going to offer an distance learning option and more people are going to chose it.
