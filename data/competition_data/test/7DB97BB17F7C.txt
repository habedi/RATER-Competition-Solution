I got to do many things when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. I didn't expect to be able to join something that helps other people. While doing what I love and, seeing all the magnificent things. You could too.

It's an amazing feeling when you are helping other people. In the Seagoing Cowboys program you are taking horses, young cows even mules and they are being shipped overseas. They are shipped to at least start helping countries after World War II.

People might think it's hard and tiring but I was doing what I love and all the hard work paid off in the end. I love being a 'Cowboy' and taking care of those precious animals. It's what I was meant to do in life and many other people feel the same way.

Some might say, 'What's in it for me?'. Well I didn't spend all of my time working I still had free time. I toured many places and did many things like, taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I also got to see Greece and China plus a significant amount of Europe. I took nine trips, more than any other Seagoing Cowboy.

In conculsion I got to do many things and you should join because no matter what others say if you love helping people, doing what you love and seeing magnificent places on the way Seagoing Cowboys would be perfect for you, like it was for me.
