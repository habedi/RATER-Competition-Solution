In today's society, students often find themselves in an enormous level of stress. Whether it is from social anxiety or overbearing schoolwork, the stress is there, and some schools have offered a solution. Distance learning, or school classes at home, have a positive impact on students lives by protecting them from bullying, softening the workload, and creating an atmosphere where children can focus and learn at their own pace.

Bullying is a problem in schools all over America. Oprah Winfrey once stated, "the best way to avoid bullying is to isolate the bully from its source." By placing students that may not feel comfortable in large crowds or a student that gets bullied into programs such as these- you have separated the bullies from the bullied allowing the problem to diminish itself.

Oftentimes, students are faced with a workload that can affect their home life and other extracurricular activities and hobbies. A student enrolled in advanced placement classes often need more time for homework than a student in a standard class. This leads to even more stress because while one regularly placed student has finished their homework hours ago, the advanced student may be rushing to finish theirs, willing to turn in sub-potential work, just to go out with friends or family. If a student was allowed to take these classes at home, they would have higher quality work because the stress is eliminated due to the lack of a time-crunch.

A public school student has many distractions that can prevent them from doing work efficiently. Thomas Jefferson emphasized the importance of focus by saying, "The only way to truly learn something is to focus on it entirely, and absorb the knowledge." A student permitted to learn from home can lead to more success; this is due to the skills they will develop by learning on their own, not guided by anyone else. At home all of the distractions start to become more vague because peer pressure is eliminated. Schooling from home allows students to focus, and do their school work more efficiently.

Some may think online school will make students lazy, but they will learn responsibility as well as other life skills that public schooling does not teach. Online schooling is a great idea for any student because it creates a safe space, time for working, and a less distracting environment.
