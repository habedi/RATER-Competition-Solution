Well my idea on this subject is that yes i understand the need to get the grades to a B to play sports. I think tough, that because a C is an average grade that they should be allowed to play with a C average. Even though i wouldn't have a problem having high enough grades to play sports but what about the people who struggle just to stay on the team with a C average. The people who try there hardest to get that average but barley keep it. Those people should be able to play because they try there hardest to get those grades but cant get them any higher.

This year was my first season on a school team so I understood the threat of that limit. But i managed to keep my grades to all A' s and one B plus. If the principle were to change this may kids wouldn't try our would but be kicked off the team which I would be upset about because C is an average grade for students. Also many kids would have been scared and there grades might have dropped anyway because of the pressure they were under to keep them up.

I say that the principle shouldn't change this because sports is a good way to keep active, fit, and healthy as a young adult. I have played on a select baseball team for the last few years and our coach a made him have our teachers write down our grades and sign it. I have seen many C' s on these papers and our coach all ways says " get those grades up or your off the team". I know if i would get kicked off the team i probably wouldn't play sports again and wouldn't keep my self active and healthy like the way i am now. Hopefully i can stay this way for the rest of my life.

This all goes back to what i said about sports and kids playing them. The more kids play sports the more healthy and active they become. If our principle did change this than many kids wouldn't of played school sports and wouldn't be as healthy and active as if they had played that sport. So i encourage the principle to keep it at C average but urge kids to do better anyway because sports are fun and keep you active.
