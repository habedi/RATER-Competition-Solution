Dear TEACHER_NAME

As a student at SCHOOL_NAME i think that your reasoning of a b average to play sports or participate in any other activities is outrageous because everybody cant make a' s or b' s every quarter. I understand that all students are able to achieve that letter grade but what if something goes wrong with the grading system or you got a grade you weren't suppose to have. Its only right to base it off they're behavior or they're character in class or how they've acted at other activities. Sometimes you may not turn in a assignment or you did do it but you got a bad grade for it. Anything could happened, its always good to strive for excellence but what if something is distracting that student at home where he/she might not have a chance to study or do his homework you have to take every aspect in to viewpoint. What if one student is homeless and he has no were to live all he can do is try his best at school. I think that if you raise the bar high enough people will strive to meet the criteria but if they don't make it but they've tried give them that opportunity to say ok next time i will do better than the last time. If i was the principal i would give students another chance if they didn't make the requirement of a b average as long as i see that they really mean that they will change they're behavior or grades. i can understand the principal's attitude on changing policy to see if the students can perform at that level but sometimes you have to take certain things into perspective.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
