The article talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can read your emotions, but would it really help in a classroom environment? That's what the minds behind this technology think. They believe it can be used in schools to show if the lesson is boring or not and if so it will switch it up, this technology can also be applied to ads on facebook for example, if you smile at the ad it will continue to show more ads like that one, but if not it will show other ads.

This seems more creepy than helpful, some people cover cameras on computers because it's so easy to hack into them but to do this you'd have to uncover your camera and so you could easily be watched without you even knowing. Even if its not hacked, would you want a camera to continously watch your every move recording everything? Not many people would.

This technology could be helpful to some people, as stated in the article "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" but for most if you don't like a lesson and its boring or confusing, there should be a button to click to modify the lesson, or if you don't like a certain ad you can already click a button saying that on facebook. This technology would'nt do much other than making people lazier than they already are, it's a cool theory but in action it would never help much. In conclusion, I don't beleive this would help more than it would hurt. We don't need all of our info inside databases and we don't need more of a reason to be lazy.
