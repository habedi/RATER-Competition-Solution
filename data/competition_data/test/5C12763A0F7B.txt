Have you ever heard of being home schooled? Homeschooling is when the parent of a child, or sometimes even the child themselves, chooses for the child to be taught school materials right from the comfort of their homes. Another alternative is for a school to have video conferencing set up so that the student can be taught by a teacher from a school right at home. This style of learning could either be very beneficial or detrimental for the student in many ways. I believe that students could very much benefit from being able to attend classes from home online or through video conferencing because it's convenient, could allow for more direct learning from an individual teacher, and could even reduce stress for parents.

Being able to attend a class online from is very convenient because it could give the student more time to work and study the different subjects they'd have to take, while allowing them to have a level of comfort regular school just can't give to them. They wouldn't have to worry about being late for school, or having to walk if their parents weren't able to drive them if they lived far from their school. Overall, giving students the ability to take classes at home could play a crucial part in stress-free education.

Students could also benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to be taught directly from a teacher. There wouldn't be any disruptive classmates that distracted them, they'd be receiving the teacher's full attention. Allowing this would greatly improve the average student's overall academic performance, and would allow for many more creative and intelligent minds.

Allowing students to attend online classes would reduce stress on the parents as well. They would no longer have to worry about having to rush their child out of the house if they slept in too late, or was simply being too slow. Online schooling would simply allow the student to take more time with their classes, which would prevent parents from being stressed out about students.

On the other hand, some may say that allowing students to take online classes could have a negative effect on the student's social skills. While this could be true in some instances, I don't believe that school is the only place a student could be social in. There a plenty of other things that could play a key role in boosting a student's social performance.

In conclusion, giving students the ability to take online classes or have video conferencing is very beneficial, and has more positive effects than negative. Giving this privilege to students would not only take the stress off of them, but the parents, and even the teachers.Â
