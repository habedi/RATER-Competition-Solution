Dear Principal,

You may be asking why? Should the kids be forced to take part in some type of community service. There kids, why should they?

Well I could give you many reasons why and why not to make the kids partake in this job.

One reason why I would agree to forcing the kids into some type of community service to insure that they ruminate what our city has to offer and the Earth's amazing resources. Do they realize what our planet has to offer? The air we breath, the flowers we smell, the rain puddles we jump in. There all part of one big cycle called Earth. And just think about it, if we could clean up just a little bit more trash in our schools courtyard, think about all the positive routes were taking. Cleaning up litter does not only clean and save our environment, but makes more sure that the kids understand what the Earth has to offer and why we should be helping out. Even if it just picking up a candy wrapper that fell on the ground outside of school. Many little actions can lead to a big difference.

Now I'm going to tell you why it would be wrong to force the kids into community service. If this were to be such a job that required being after school later than usual, that can ultimately result in some sort of problem.

Like me, most kids enjoy sports or doing clubs after school. Participating in community service could drag kids away from what being a kid is all about. Having fun. But now you might be saying to yourself, the kids are old enough and should be taking more moral obligation.

While I agree with that assumption, it might be wrong to assume they should be taking more time away from their prior commitments. Not only could community service take away from sports and other functions, it can take away kids from being with their families more often.

And to most parents like mine, family time is very noble.

So whatever the choice, there are many positives and negatives to forcing us kids into community service. My thought or theory to take from this is, why don't you limit the amount of community service. Kids could be assigned certain days where there group is assigned trash pick up. That way, it might only be one day out of the week, to me, that's not bad and wouldn't take away from sports or other events too much. Meanwhile your helping the environment.

So I hope you can consider this letter and make the right alternative about which to do.

GO GREEN!
