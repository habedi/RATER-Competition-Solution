When you look at these pictures what do you see? It may be a face to some people and to others it might be just a natural landform. We'll never really know the truth unless somebody goes there or since its been a while it may not even be there anymore. If you went there would you come back with false or true evidnece to help support what you think it is.

On May 24,2001 the text say, "Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be starring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia." This shows that if this two mile long "human face" was real this must of had to of been a giant living on Mars. The text also says "Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." This shows that this helps us know that it could of just of been a Martian mesa since its common around Cydonia.

In the image of 1998 I can see where they see the face, but then look at the picture from 2001 it just looks like a large landform. Yes it could of decayed but then by the time 1998 come it should have already been decayed and you would of thought that from image from 1976. If the mesa was a human face then it wouldn't really have all those cracks like the image from 2001 has. The text says " A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see." What kind of rucous do you think this would of caused?

The text says " A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This shows that they might of added the resembles a human face, because they can't really put if it was unless somebody actually went to Mars. Many people would have had there different opinions on if it were really a human face without the 'Resembles a human head" part or not.

The authors who wrote the story about the resembles a human head thought it would be a good way to have the public engage in attention toward Mars. It did! the text says "The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows." This shows that the Face on Mars is so popular even though it couldn't be a real human head.
