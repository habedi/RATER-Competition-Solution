Teachers should not be allowed to give their students a summer project at all.

The summer is supposed to be the student's break.

If the teachers do give them a project over the summer it should at least be the student's choice.

The student can make the project revolve around their vacation that way it will not take as much time from what is supposed to be a break from school work.

When a kid chooses to do something they will have a lot more interest in what they are doing which will result in better work ethic.

If the student gets told what to do then they will want to rebel and make a bad project with little effort; they might not even do the project.

Since the reason they are doing a summer project in the first place is so that they continue to learn over the summer, then it is in the teachers best interest to let the students decide what it is on.

For example; In eighth grade I wanted to be in the science fair and I got to choose what the project was on.

The project was my choice and I ended up getting second place in the competition.

This year for chemistry all the students had to do a project that was related to chemistry.

The project was a large portion of our grade so we had to do it.

Everyone did their own project and presented it in front of class.

The projects were not very good and only a few people got above a 90 percent.

If it had not been mandatory and was for extra credit project, than the students probably would have put forth more effort and gotten a better grade.

This shows that they should get to choose their summer projects that way they actually try to make a good project instead of being lazy like they did on the chemistry project.

In some cases it could be better to let the teachers decide on the projects, because then they will be easier to grade, since they will all be similar.

The students could benefit from this too because then they can help each other or even make a group project.

It would also be beneficial to the kids who struggle to make decisions because then they won't have to waste time thinking about what to do the project on.

Although, I do not think these benefits outweigh the benefits of the students getting to decide on their own project.

Over the summer students should get to rest their minds and relax.

In order to do this the work that they are given over the summer should be easy.

If a teacher gives a summer project then they should let them decide what it is on that way it will be as easy as it gets to do the project.

The main purpose of the summer is for students to get a break from school work and the teachers should not ruin it with a boring project they decided we would have to do.
