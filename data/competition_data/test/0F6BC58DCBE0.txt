I agree with a Facial Action Coding System that is used to identify human emotions."The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles." With a facial action coding system you could change and make the world a better place,you could get law enforcement to invest in facial action coding system's. "Eckman,has classified six basic emotions- happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles." Using this type of technology can actually help a lot,you can stop teen suicides from happening,you can stop school shootings from happening...But what I mean by that is you can help the person out that's feeling grieving,depressed and mad by talking to them about their problems or maybe what's going on at home or anywhere else, you can scan that persons face and see what emotions they're feeling. Overall, I think that this could show people what technology really is about and how we can inspire kidsto do the same,it could keep kids out of trouble and give them motovation to do good things in their community or around the world.
