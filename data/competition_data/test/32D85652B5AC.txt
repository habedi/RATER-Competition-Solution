Everyday, students enjoy themselves and learn new skills while interacting with their classmates. Not only is school a place to learn, the classrooms hold many children of the same ages who get the chance to communicate and discover new things about each other. Putting children in school is one of the most beneficial decisions a parent can make. Although many people believe distance learning from home is the most helpful way of learning because it better fits the busy schedules of children, learning in school is much more beneficial because children get the opportunity to learn and interact with others, students will not become dependent on technology, and kids will adapt to necessary time management skills.

To begin with, school may not be the most exciting time of the day, but it teaches many life skills used regularly. In the classrooms, students work together in teams to complete tasks and share ideas. Whether somebody is working in a job or purchasing something from the store, these necessary interaction skills are all taught in the early years of school. For example, if somebody completed their schooling online and was ready to go off to college, they would have a tough time getting around due to the fact that they have had no prior communication with other students. Completing school inside the classroom relieves stress from students who might be struggling on something while working alone online. Students who take advantage of learning in class together will learn important interaction and communication skills.

In addition, technology is increasingly becoming a part of everyday life for people all over the world. Children everywhere are being influenced by their screen, preventing them from focusing on the task at hand. In order for kids to stay kids, they must physically stay in school and not take online courses from home. While many kids are becoming well rounded and physically active with each other, some children are stuck at home taking online school through their computers. For example, the children in school will learn to do things on their own using their heads without having to rely on technology. Students who only interact with people through their screens will become more and more dependent on technology which can cause many problems down the road.

Last but not least, time management is one of the most important skills for people to have no matter what age they might be. The whole world is running on a strict schedule every hour of the day. When students attend classes in school, they get up on time, get themselves ready, and learn how to balance their busy schedules. Learning how to manage time at a young age is no easy task; however, students can master their skills by physically taking classes in school and preparing for life ahead. Children who take online school courses will struggle in the future to balance their time and live a life full of stress.

In conclusion, learning in school is much more beneficial for children because they get the chance to interact and communicate with others, they will not become reliant on technology alone, and they will learn necessary time management skills to be used everyday. When every child is enrolled into their school for class, they will be ready for the future and prepared for anything that life might throw their way. On the other hand, if children remain in online courses, they will struggle communicating with other people throughoutÂ their entire lives. Every student should be physically put into school to ensure a great future at this very moment.
