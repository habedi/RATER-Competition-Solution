Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I agree with the idea of students participating in sports activities unless they have a B average. I think this is a great idea because the students would be able to make it to college if they don't get a sports scholarship, the parents would be satisfied with the grade that their son or daughter gets, and the students would have a bright future because they would have a perfect reputation.

The first reason is that if the students have to get a B average in their grade that would make them desperate which would make the students smarter, which would get the students to pass the S.A.T test when they go to college, and if they do get into to college the school's reputation would better since the school changed the student's grade.

Also it would make the students easier to get them to college id they don't get a sports scholarship. Also the students would be happy to because they can play their favorite sports, and get a better grade, and good reputation that would follow the student untill they graduate college, which would make a good look when the people in the college looks at it, not like who got a bad grade since the councilors would hate the students before even meeting him.

Another reason why is that the parents would be satisfied with the work that their children has done, and their children would have a better reputation with sports. The parents would talk to their friends and tell them how great the school is, and their friends would tell their friends how good our school is and that could make this school a lot more popular then before.

The last reason is that the student's future would be right because the reputation can get a company to hire him with the reputation he had in his school years. Then many colleagues from the company might send their children to our school.

These are the reasons why I agree with the ideas, I hope that you will not change your mind about this reasons.

Thank You,
