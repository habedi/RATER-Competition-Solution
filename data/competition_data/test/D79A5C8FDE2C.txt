Many schools around the United States offer a multitude of online classes that students can take from home. In matter of fact, these classes can be electives or actual course classes, like English or math class. Furthermore, students having the opportunity to enroll in online classes can be super beneficial in many different ways. For example, students who may have disabilities can take online courses to make school easier for them or students who do after school activities, like sports can take online courses so they will have more time to do homework or complete other classwork. Even though many people would agree that taking online classes is beneficial, others believe that it isn't beneficial at all.

First off, the majority of schools around the United States all have students who may have a disability. Unfortunately, for some of these students with disabilities, it may be hard for them get up on their own or even leave their houses. For these students to have the opportunity to enroll in online classes that their school offers, this can be greatly beneficial for them in a lot of ways. For example, these students won't have to worry about falling behind in school or missing anything important. Also by taking classes at home, will help them still get the right education they need in order to be successful in school, so they won't miss out due to their circumstances.

As a matter of fact, I have a personal experience with taking online classes. Personally, it helped me a lot and I really enjoyed taking an online course both my freshman and sophomore year of high school. Furthermore, I am athlete who trains for five hours everyday right after school, and I found it very challenging to juggle between student life and athlete life. I knew I had to do something that would help me balance my school work and my practices. Having the opportunity to enroll in an online class, so I would have more time to complete homework and other classwork and still be able to train for my sport was probably the best offer I have ever got and it really benefited me in both student life and athlete life.

Although many people would agree that online classes are very beneficial for students, there are others who would strongly disagree with that for many reasons. To continue, people think that students having the opportunity to take online classes won't help benefit them at all, because students will be distracted at home and won't pay attention in class. Also, others believe that students will cheat their way through the class and won't actually learn anything. Adding on, what these people need to realize is that the majority of students who take online classes take them for a specific reason, and it is mostly to help benefit them in school. In my experience with online classes, it greatly benefited me and many others who did the online class with me.

In conclusion, a lot of schools around the United States offer online classes for students to enroll in. These online courses are offered in a variety of different types of classes. Such as, English, math, and even art classes, that students can take throughout the year. Furthermore, having the opportunity to take these classes can help benefit students who may have disabilities or who are involved in after school sports. Although many people would agree that students having the opportunity to take online classes can be beneficial, there are others who would highly disagree and believe it isn't beneficial at all.
