Students may have probelms and can be mad or sad in sometimes but some people don't like when someone comes to them and start asking then about how they feel, some studens could prefer woek on their problemas by themselves.

First of all, using a system that shows how you fell could be a little bit too far, it's ok to care about other but knowing how they fell could disrespect their privacy "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", what about is sad because he is having family problems? it would be rude to ask him why are you feeling sad in front of a class.

People actually feel bad a lot of times, and some people don't like others to stay on their bussiness. I would be really wierd to see how someone feel wtith helpa from a compute, if you are trying to help somebody, it not honest to know how someone else feels with a computer system, if you really care about someone, whn you are about someone, you should ask them how they feel and if they don't anything is because he don't want other people to knwo about it, people shoul respects the other's feelings.

Using a system that shows how someone feels in students is disrespectful, because you are not respecting their privacy, they should never use those systems at school. -
