Ding,Ding,Ding the final bell rings before summer, students are screaming and bouncing around the halls. Just to find out that, they are assigned a summer project. But this year is different the students are designing their own projects. Students are relieved that they can choose their own project because, it gives them freedom,allows them to express their creativity, and convince.

However,teachers projects are the outline to assist the students for success. Teachers are there to educate the student through everything "I'm here to train you, not hurt you" from Jackie Chan(Karate Kid). The training is like the summer project to start the foundation for the future. Teachers formulate an effective summer project for the students because, they're reliable, preparation for the future, and introduce an formidable task. Freedom is quite important to everyday life, so why not in projects as well.

Firstly, the students have freedom in their projects. Students could pick topics that interest them to formulate a project into it. Students could relate to "now I do what I want"(Lil Uzi).The song is quite literal to the freedom for the project. The freedom aspects is very uncommon in assignments, during summer usually students would have to read a book of the teachers choice and write an essay about it. Students having a choice and freedom is unique to choose there own project. A student with special skills could demonstrate there talents and natural abilities.

Secondly, the students are allowed to express their creativity. Students with skills set could demonstrate their talent in there project. For example a student that is good with technology could add effects to the project and have no limitations from the teacher. Students are like magicians "magicians don't reveal there tricks"(Inspection) every student could have a skill set that they're not showing which is why they're like magicians. Students that are able to demonstrate there creativity is game changing in there project. Theres a saying that time is the foundation of life.

Thirdly, the students convince for the project is very important. Students can complete there project anywhere he or she goes. Average students tend to go on trips during the summer to explore and create family bonding. While they're on the trip they could also complete there project because it's in there own rules and convince. Students value there summer vacation time so convince doing the project is very important. "you have to treat time wisely"(One Piece) students wouldn't want to miss a trip because of a project that there teacher assigned, so students would prefer the convince to do there project when ever and where ever.

Finally, students would appreciate to demonstrate what they're best at, there time over the summer break, and express what ever they want. Smiles would appear on students faces due to what they were assigned over break. Summer is a time every kid remembers,so making it the best is very important. The next time the bells rings students should look forward to the summer project.
