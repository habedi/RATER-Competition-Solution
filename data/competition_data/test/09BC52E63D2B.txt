There are many reasons why you or anybody else who loves to explore and discover incredible places should join the Seagoing Cowboy program . It's not just helping other people , it's also about helping yourself .

One of the reasons is because of the opportunties you have to discover new places . This is a lifetime opportunity and we want you to join us . I have been to so many wonderful places like Greece , China , Panama and Europe . Imagine if you could get the chance to go there, would you say yes to the opportunity?

You don't just get to see beautiful landmarks but you also get to help people who's homes , cities and towns were destroyed and left in ruins. To them , for helping there homes recover you would be a hero . You can take care of animals when you are on seas . Those animals are shipped to the people who's homes were destroyed .

Thats not just what you do on the job you also get to mentally help yourself . I saw the poor families that lost almost everything during World War II . You will understand that you are lucky enough to have a strong and protective country that protects you from enemies . It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years .

You really won't find it boring because Don Reist and I came up with thing to do during trips. For example we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed after they were unloaded . We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing,boxing, reading, whittling and other games that helped pass the time. You can also be creative and make up your own games .

I, Luke Bomberger, want you to come work with me because your helping me , people around the world in need , and your self . These are all the reasons why you should come work with me and my partners at UNRRA and the Seagoing Cowboys . I hope you can decide to come with me in this lifetime opportunity.
