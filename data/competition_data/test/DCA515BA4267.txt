The author has supported this idea by showing us facts expecely the computers. Now a days the computers are so delicate but this is how the author worded it "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate". The author also said that venus is sometime called "Evening Star". People also call it Earths twin because venus is the closest planet to Earth. In paragraph 3 the author tells us whats in venus starting with a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets venus. Also the clouds in venus are full of sulfuric acid. If that dont think thats scary the temperatures will. The temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that we experience on planet Earth. If we were to land on the surface not only will we litterly burn our inside we would crush from the pressher. The pressher is so strong it could crush a submarine. In paragraph 5 the author is talking about NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface. The scientists want to create like a blimp vehicle that hovers 30 or so miles above the surface of venus. People think that in venus there were oceans live things they say there was once life and even today Venus has some of the same things of Earth.
