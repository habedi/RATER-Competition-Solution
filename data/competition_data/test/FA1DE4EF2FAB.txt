Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student of SCHOOL_NAME, I personally believe that phones should not be allowed at school for three main reasons. Safety, distraction , and responsibility is the main purpose and there are three reasons into what i have to say. Being in middle school is a experience all students would like to remember. Having cell phones on school property is something I am sure all parents worry about .

Safety is the number one goal , when SCHOOL_NAME

was built back in 2009 , I believe. By having cell phones it takes a toll on a lot of our students. For example , PROPER_NAME is in the eight grade and there is a new girl that just moved to Texas and goes to RELATIVE_NAME school. Well, RELATIVE_NAME and her boyfriend broke up , because now he like the new girl , OTHER_NAME. Since RELATIVE_NAME is so popular at her school during class one day she takes her phone out , while they are taking a test and texts all of her little groupie's. Well little does OTHER_NAME know but they all are going to gang up on her at the restrooms. This all occurred through a text message which cause so much to occur at any time .

Distractions are another event that happens when schools allows students to have cellular devices. Instead of paying attention in class , 75% of the students are focused on texting other fellow students. Well one day when threes a big text mainly half of the class has failed the test due to having a distraction , considered as a cell phone . But little does the teacher know that they all failed because they had their phones out causing them to stay off task and have more fun texting and whatever else they cell phones carry .

Responsibility , is something kids should start doing entering middle school, being responsible about everything. Having a cell phone on school grounds is a big one. Once of school grounds its no longer the schools problem if stolen its yours. Your phone could $800 dollars alone , if stolen or lost at school , its your responsibility in order to find what you lost.

So as a eight grader and the experiences I have had in my past , I truly think all electronic devices can be brought to school , but kept off during all hours of your teaching and learning. Also if your bringing them to school on a daily basis it is your responsibility to keep up with what you bring with you at all times. Like our school quote say, "Except Excellence In Everything ".
