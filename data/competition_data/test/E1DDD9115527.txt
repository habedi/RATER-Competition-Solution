Hello everyone. Today I am going to talk about the disadvantages of taking a home school program, one of the down sides of taking a home school program, it would be the students effort,and development of skills, and abilities. students develop many skills throw classroom work such as communication, team work, and leader ship. when a student works in groups they learn new ways of solving problems,and learn the values of working as a team, and with the home school program a student won't develop the same skills in fact that would affect them later on.

many times students compete to be the best, to finish faster, to get better grades,because they wanna stand out from the others. but when a student works alone there most likely going to give less effort and there going to feel like there doing the best that they can,when there not. for example when a soccer player or football player is trying out to get in a team for the first time they think i am good i can do this. but when they see the abilities of others. they wanna work hard to be at there level because he know that there better than him.

but that gives him motivation to prove and challenge him self to see what hes capable of.

the fact that students get to work in groups is amazing because students learn from each other and it becomes less stressful. for example when a group has to do a project everyone is going to have a job, and everyone can share there points of view to make sure everything is at its best, and working in a group makes everything easier and it cut the amount of time to finish. and working alone it would be more stressful because the student has to do more work, and he wont see all the problems when other people could.

even tho theses students that will love to do the job at home they know participating in class helps a lot to remember what they have learned. and its easy to say when a student is home it wont put as much effort that a student in classroom because he will take a lot of time to finish his work when in a class room the students have a time period.

in conclusion a student thats attending to classes is going to be more successful than a student thats taking classes at home because of the simple fact that the student that is in the class room is participating on activities and working with other students, learning new ways to solve problems. and the student that takes home school its not developing the simple skills of communication, team work and leader ship because hes going to have to work and do things on his own.
