The principal has decided to have every student participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These activities can range from joining the sports team for a student's school too serving in student council. I agree with the new rule because extra curricular activities makes students have an identity about who they are as a person in school, it can make students have a good resume for a job they want to do or if they want to get into college, and it can help reduce stress in students from school, from school, family, friends, or anything else by doing the things they love.

First, extra curricular activities makes students who they are in school and it gives them an identity. By having a student do an extra curricular activity may even show to other students and teachers about what they strive to do in the future. This is important because it shows teachers and others that a student has pride in what they want to do and that they want to be successful in school and in the future. Along with the academics, students can put their extra curricular activities on their resume which goes to the next point.

Extra curricular activities makes a student's resume above average. By having a student put their extra curricular activitiesÂ on their resume would make a complete, better resume than just putting what they chose for their core classes. For example, students will have to make a resume for a college they want to apply or if they want to get any sort of job. Having a more impressive resume with extra curricular activities would make the student or person more likely to get into that college or the job that they wanted. It can make the process less stressful which goes to the last and final point.

Extra curricular activities can help reduce stress in a student from school or anywhere else they get stressed from. Extra curricular activities lets students take their mind off what stresses them out like school, family, or friends and makes them do the things they love. It may even help with academics because they are not so stressed and nervous about their classes. It can make students have more breathing room about school life and not feel like they have tons and tons of work to do.

In conclusion, extra curricular activities makes students have an identity about who they are in school, it can improve their resume for college or if they wanted to get a job, and lastly it can help students reduce stress by having them do the things they want to do and getting their mind off school work, tests, and their core academics. All these reasons can make a student more successful in school or in the future for when they get a job. No matter what grade a student is in school, they should do extra curricular activities. These are all the reasons for why students should do extra curricular activities.
