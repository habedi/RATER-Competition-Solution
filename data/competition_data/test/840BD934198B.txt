Do you really want to spend your day crammed in your house being bored and doing nothing? Well I don't. And because of that I believe that all students should participate in sports. You might be thinking "Why should I," well you should because you become healthy, it brings new opportunitys, and a better mental health.

Sports can help you become healthy. One way you can become healthy is that you're constanly excersicing. You are running, lifting weights, stretching, and more. Another way is that you're outside. If you're outside it's better for you because you need sunlight and fresh air. The last way is that you're given a new group. It's healthy to be around different people then just school friends. If you can't find a way to be active well then try a sport because there are many sports to choose from.

You are given new opportunities through sports. What I mean by that is you can be given scholarships. If you end up being really good at a sport then you could try to get a scholarship for college. A second way you're given a new opportunity is new friends. Since you're surrounded by kids your age 2-3 times a week might as well become friends with them. Lastly, you're in a new enviorment which is good. It can be a nice change from your usual schedule. We all need new opportunities sometimes and it can't hurt to try them.

Your mental health can improve from doing sports. The first way mental health can improve is by running. When you're running your stress and anxiety goes away because you have a break from it. You can be put in a better mood. Studies show that being active improves your mood. The last way your mental health can improve is you get a better sleep. If you've been active all day then you're most likely going to be tired when you get home which can help you get a better sleep for school the next day. If you still think that sports sound boring then think about you and how you can improve as a person and fix your mental health through this.

In conclusion I believe that all students should participate in sports. You can become healthy and fit so you're ready for bikini season. Change is good so put yourself out there and do a sport it can't hurt to try. Become a better version of yourself and improve your mental health. For all these reasons I've given I believe kids should participate in sports.
