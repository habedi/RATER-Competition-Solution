Dear Administrator,

I've heard that your school is having trouble whether or not to give students the option to study at home using online or video conferencing. My opinion on the matter is that students shouldn't be allowed to study at home, but rather have them learn at school because it can much more beneficial than learning at home. Studying at school can help with social interactions with people they may not know, which can't be learned at home because they're always around the same people. Studying at school can also help with confidants. For example, at home they aren't going to present their project they made to their family because they aren't going to understand what's happening, but at school students have to present in front of class. While many don't like doing it, it still helps them with at least gaining a little confidants. Studying at school can also be funner because students can hang out with their friends at school, while students studying at home are just lonely and studying waiting to finish the school day to finish. In my opinion, I would much rather study with friends along side me because that's much funner than studying alone at home. While some may say that studying at home can be more beneficial because they can stay without having to get up early to learn, or they can be conformable while studying, it can help in them short term, but in the long term it'll hurt them more because they'll always want to stay home to do everything they need to do. Maybe they'll want a to learn a job that requires them to go outside all the time and they refuse to learn that job that they maybe would've wanted to learn all their life all because they're too scared to go outside for long periods of time. Instead of getting the job they wished for, they get a job that can be done in their house but makes them sad because it reminds them of how paranoid they are. If they would've studied at school, there could've been much less of a chance of this happening because they have to get out of the house in order to get to school, and they could've made more friends that like to go outside and they always go out with them because of the fun it is to be outside with friends. I hope that you listen to my request to not add the ability for students to learn at home because it can hurt them. Make them go to school and make them realize that school is much more than just learning about subjects there.

Sincerely,
