dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing a letter to you to explain why we should perform community service. Here are three reasons why we should perform community service. One is that it makes our community look better. Second is that it can teach us some responsibility's. third is that if we do community service it will keep us out of trouble and become better people.

First, is that we should do community service our community will look better. It will look better because we will pick up the trash in our community. If we pick up trash we will have more visitors. When we perform community service it makes us look clean and not like trashy people. If we did one hour of community service a day we could get a lot of stuff done like cleaning up trash cutting grass around the area and making sure everything is nice and clean. Truly community service would make our community a better looking place.

second, community service would teach us several responsibility 's. It would teach us responsibility's such as we got to keep our area clean. When we do what we are told things will go much easier. It will also teach us that we got to do what's best for our community and it will make us better people by helping out the community. All in all community service will teach us some responsibility's that we will need in life to go farther in life.

Third, community service will keep us out of trouble. It will keep us out of trouble because it will give us things to do and stay busy. Community service gives us great responsibility's in life. We get it trouble when we have nothing to do and we trying to start stuff to get everybody mad. When we perform community service we don't get in trouble because we are not bored and we are not trying to start stuff.

In conclusion community service will keep us out of trouble cause it will keep us busy

All in all community service gives us gives us good reason to want to perform it. It makes our community look better and it teaches us great responsibility's. Community service also keeps us out of trouble it does this because it keeps us busy. Community service is great for our community for these reasons.
