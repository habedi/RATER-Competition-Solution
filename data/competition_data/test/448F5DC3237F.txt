i am against it because are principal should let students participate in sports even if they have a c because it not a f so they are doing with c if my principal don't let people with a c play sports he will not have that many students playing sports and he should give them un tell some date to have there grades up or they will not play sports and the students that worked hard to get a b so they can play they will but this is is why i go against my principals choose. he shouldn't do students like because he will not have no sports because some kids may be want to be on the team but they have a f he should say i will let u play but bye lets say

July u have to have that f up or i am putting u off the team he should do that for all the students or just let the students try out and if they have a f just make them work harder if they really want to play. that is why i disagree with my principal about this statement.
