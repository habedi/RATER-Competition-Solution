Many people today are accepting the idea of limiting car usage around the world. Though cars are an excellent way to get around they might not be the best for the enviorment. In a city in Germany, Vauban is home to many residents who do not own a car. In fact 70% do not have one and 57% sold a car to move there. These people aren't only seeing an environmental effect but also they seem more happy.

Pollution is also a problem when it comes to motor veichles. When Paris had a record day of pollution they decided to take action and inforced a partial driving ban. In just five days, congestion in France was down 60%. As you can see limiting car usage is already benefitting many and the more we turn to it the most likely we are to be living a more happy and safer life.

In places such as Bogota, Colombia there are days called car-free day. These days only buses and taxis are only allowed, so some people just bike, hike, or skate. The ultimate goal is to reduce smog and stress. Some Colombian cites are joining in on the event as well making this a growing imporvment campaign. This day has made many imporvments to the way of life, making the city look cleaner, cutting traffic time, and creating upscale shopping districts.

When it comes to America we can already see a decrease in car usage from 2005. If this number continues we will see beneficial environmental chages. Though the car industry will probably will be hit hard they already are discussing a plan to partner with telecommunications industry. They want to create safer public transportation and by doing so they would be saving time and conserving our resources.

There seems to be more advantages than disadvantages when it comes to limiting  car usage. I feel when everyone gets the idea that a safer and cleaner world is in the best intrest of everyone. then we will be taking the right steps to a new and better life.
