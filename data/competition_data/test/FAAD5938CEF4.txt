Dear Mrs. Principal,

I understand your concern about student's grades. The bar has just been getting lower and lower. But requiring an above average grade for anyone who wants to participate in sports or other activities is just out of the question. Why? Because people don't care that much about their grades. It's one thing to require an average grade of a C. That's appropriate because people don't have to put much time and energy into that. But once people have to go above that just to be able to do extra curricular activities, you are stuck with an issue. People will either grow resentment and purposefully get grades below average just to protest, or they will come right out and show their feelings in ways that are inappropriate for school. And on top of that, for a lot of kids, aside from school, They have no life, nothing to do. I know the following is very cliche, but it does lead to obesity, drugs, and undesirable behavior. Whether these kids know it or not, school related activities save them from a path in life that no one should have to go through. If you make having these privileges harder to earn, you will not only end up with resentful students, but with unhealthy ones, in every way.

Please consider my opinion and hopefully act on it. This is my school too. I personally think following through on this policy change is simply unjust. Since when did it become someone'seles job to control how you go through life?

Thank you for your time and consideration

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
