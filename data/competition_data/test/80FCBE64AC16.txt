Dear principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, i am one of you're students. i am writing you this letter to tell you how i feel about the new law that had being made in the about if a student doesn't have at least a B average, they will not be able to participate in other activities.

My concern is that, it's should not be a B average for a student to participate in other activities because not all students learn the way that their teacher teaches them. some of them are more comfortable with a type of learning, and others aren't. to be a B average student is not as easy as it's seems because some students may have problems at home and cannot focus hundred percent on their school activities. I deeply believe that it should only be a C average because of many reason. first of all: some students aren't very familiar with the learning tactics. second of all: C is most of the kids average, and if most of the kids aren't going to be able to participate in school activities, then there wont be enough money in the school's finances. last of all: some kids feels the need that they should be part of other activities otherwise they wont be able to focus at all on their school's works.

these are the main reasons that i think a B average should not be allow, but a C average is mostly fair for the entire school. i sincerely hope that you think about all that I've said and apply it.

from STUDENT_NAME.
