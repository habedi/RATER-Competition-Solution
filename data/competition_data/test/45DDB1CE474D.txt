You ask how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enable computers to identify human emotions. Here's my explanation of why I think it's a good creation.

I think that this is a good creation because if you dont know how someone if feeling in a picture you can figure out by this machine. I aslo think this a good creation beacuse its taking technology to a new level. You might ask how is it taking technology to a new level. Its taking it to a new level because there actually building a machine that tells how someone if feeling. Thats just amazing! Thats one reason why I like this machine.

People might wonder how do they know how someone is feeling through a picture. Or people might think maybe there's just putting something to make it seem real just make us think. Cause it's not possibly to show someone feeliing from a picture because you don't how that person is feeling inside. So thats why this machine can be bad.

I personally think thats this is a bad creation becuase its a waste of time to me. Why would anybody want to know how someone is feeling through a picture. When there reaction shows how they are feelings. Thats why I dont like this machine. This machine is pointless!

Thats my reasons why I think thats this machine is going to be a fail. And there's other people that might like this creation. To me though I dont like it.
