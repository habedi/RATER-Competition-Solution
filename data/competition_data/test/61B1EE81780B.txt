Dear Principle,

Do you think our community needs change? I do i thank there is many ways to change our community but one of the easiest ways to do this would be to get kids to get active in cleaning up their community. I think kids should be required to help the community in which they live! It would also give them reason to be proud. I thank it could be very rewarding, everyone would benefit if the community got cleaner.

Also it would make a positive impact on the on other communities, if they see that our community is getting clean they might follow in our community's footsteps!

If kids got active in their own community would be nice because they would be proud of themselves and be proud of their accomplishments.

They would be somebody others are proud of! I think having that sense of pride would help them in life now and in the future. They could also learn many things from doing this one of them things being aware that littering is not good for the community. This is only one of the hundreds of things they could learn.

It would also reward them because living in this community would be nicer and easier.

They may also receive other rewards for doing this. Community service in the present would look good later because it would help to be able to put that on a job or college application.

It would also help populate the community because anyone would choose a clean happy community over somewhere dirty and chaotic. So this would help a lot, in my opinion.

Another pro to having community service would be that other community's would follow in our footsteps!

If we could get a communities around us aware of the benefits they might do the same thing and then our region would be cleaner.

And we would all benefit if others followed us because we would then easily be recognized as nice place to be. That would also help them as well. And they might help other communit
