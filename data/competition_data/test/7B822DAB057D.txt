Driveless cars would be above one of the nations craziest inventions ever made. They have been working on this for many of years but just havent made it final yet. My postion on driveless cars is that i think it would be good for handicap people but thats it. The author made a huge point stating that "in the case of a accident whose fault will it be, the drivers or the manufactuer."

I respect that they have done lots of data throughout the years and they come to find out that more and more people have lost their lives because of bad driving or failure of being sober. They have tried to put more police on the road and made alot of new laws but its just hard task to complete with trying to get drunk drivers off the road. They have made soberiaty checkpoints and stuff like that but there still seems to be, that people are driving under the influence. If thats the case then i dont think there is any point in making driverless cars because no matter what someone is always driving bad on the streets.

The feeling of not having to drive your car and being able to sit back and relax in your car is nice but, I dont see how that could possibly work because if you were to get into a accident then whats coming back on you, what are you first to do? Sue the manufactuer or is it in your fault since you own the car. The last thing , If driverless cars were to be on the streets you would think everybody would have one? I would think the pricing would be a ridiclous amount of money because of how much time they invested in making driverless cars succsessfull.

Driverless cars was defeintly a brillant idea but at this point in time i dont think they have a strong enough impact for it to workout. Transportation has become a huge impact upon the nation today because without it people would have to walk everywhere and that would be time consuming. I think this essay has a great arguement wheather or not that this is a good idea but in my postion i think the best way to go is just to try and be as safe as possible on the roads and pay attention at all times on the road.
