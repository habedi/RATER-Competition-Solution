The Principle has made the decision that all students currently enrolled at the high school must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, however I believe this is a terrible decision. My personal belief is that making students do something extra besides schoolwork may lead to backlash by both students and parents.

If the Principle does follow through with this decision the result would be rather troubling and frankly I fear that the productiveness of all students could decline as a result of forced activities. While some students taking part in extracurricular activities may do some good, forced participation by all students attending the schools is downright foolish. For situations like the one we are currently faced with one must think about whether or not to support this. In my personal viewpoint I believe this all boils down to a risk/reward scenario meaning is the reward higher than the risk or the other way around, but I ensure all of those reading this that the risk is higher than any conceivable reward.

If all students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity then some parents may file complaints of their children getting home later than expected. Many students may get upset at the fact that they have less time at home to spend playing games, spending time with family or pets, or watching television. Multiple students could use the extra activities during the day as an excuse for not being able to do homework. Students may get stressed with too much additional stuff added to their schedules leading to them being more irritable, tired, and all around less productive. Students may attempt to fake sickness as to avoid participating in an extracurricular activity they may be displeased with. Students may get less time to study for tests.

In conclusion I believe that the Principle should revoke their decision due to the amount of damage it may cause to the productiveness of students.
