I believe that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

These are many reasons why I strongly agree that we should do at least one extracurricular activity.

I agree that we should do this because if we do more activities then we can make more friends and we can share things that we like that some of our school friends dont like to do.

I also believe that if we can try something new we share our experience on what we are doing and your friend or someone you know may want to try it to and try new things that they are afraid to do.

Another reason why I think that this is a wonderful idea is because kids need to get out more and do more things outside of school, and when you do that you might meet someone that can help you in the future for your college or for your career.

Another main reason that we should do extracurricular activities is because if we do more stuff that we think is cool or something we love then we all won't be sitting around at home during the summer or over the summer.

If we just work hard on it and we try our best that might be something that you may want to do in college or a career.

We can also have more fun on the weekends or for the summer if you do at least one more extracurricular activities.

You may also be able to go to new places if you do these actives, they may go on trips that can be really fun.

They may also do something fun with the team like go bowling or just doing something fun.

I also strongly agree that we should do that because if we do more stuff then maybe you can become great at it and maybe there might be a chance of you going to college for it or getting a scholarship.

I know that some kids don't want to do a lot of activities and they put all their eggs in one basket but it is also good that they do more than one because if they do then they have more opportunity's for them.

Another reason that I believe that we should do this is because some kids don't want to do things outside of school but the main reason they should do at least one is because some kids don't interact with people at school and they get teased and when they get home they put themselves down so if they have something they can do outside of school they will be more happy to do what they like and see their friends. I think its really important that they do extracurricular activities so they can get out there and meet better people so they can have the best child hood they can have.

I also believe that they should do this is so kids that come from bad homes can try to get away from the negative stuff even if its for an hour some kids just want to get away sometimes, and getting them away from that negative energy can make them do better in school.

I feel like when they do things they love or want try to do it takes their mind off what they are going through even if it's not for that long.

My conclusion is that this is a great idea that we do this so we can meet new people with the same interest that we have.

We can also get ourselves prepared for college and ready for the outside world when we have to do new things just to make sure that they can afford things like clothes, food, shelter, and etc.

I think that this is great because we may do some fun things with your teammates or you may even go to places you never been before.

Those are the reasons why I think it is important that we do at least one activity after school.
