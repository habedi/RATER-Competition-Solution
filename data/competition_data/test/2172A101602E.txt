Pretend there is a student that attends this school. He is quite troubled in his life; he doesn't live in the best neighborhood, his parents don't have the time to care for him, and he gets involved with the worst kinds of people. He is even failing in academics. One day, the principle decides to enanct a new school rule:

All students must partake in at least one extracurricular activity.

This student is put on the

Green Life Team , a program devoted to make the Earth more green and healthy. At first, he is reluctant and shows no effort in the program. Though, overtime, he changes into a completely different person. He smiles more, stays away from bad people, and picks up his grades. In most cases, a person who is having a rough time in their life needs one confident boost to get back up. It would be a life-changing thing if the students at this school were given that boost through extracurricular activities.

There are many kids in schools around the world that think they have a bad life. This factor has been scientifically proven to lower one's happiness, smarts, and confidence levels. Along with other things, this can leave the person with a "hole"; an emotional hole, that once made, is hard to fill. Most young teens with this "hole" will start to believe that their only solutions are drugs and various kinds of smoking, maybe even death. These struggling youths must learn that there is so much more to life than just those few options. By encouraging and pushing those who have this "hole" to participate in positive acitivities, the goal to better the life of the school's students is achievable.

Extracurricular activities can make a huge and positive impact on someone's life. By showing people that there is more to life than a vape or pills or giving up, it can 100% change them. Yes, some people may be easier to convince, and some people may be harder. That is perfectly normal. It doesn't mean the person who is easier will take less time than others, and it doesn't always mean that the harder ones need more help. It all just goes to show how some people need an arm to guide them, and how some just need a good old kick in the rear-end to lead them down the right path.
