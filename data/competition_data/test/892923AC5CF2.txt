Have you ever seen the face on Mars? Well, if you have, do you think it's a real face, or that aliens made it, or that it's just a natural landform like the ones we have here? The answer is, that it's just a natural landform. This face that we see on Mars is just a landform that was created over time. Just like the natural landforms created here on Earth. Things like the Rocky Mountains, or as it says in the passage, the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

This face on the surface of Mars had unusual shadows casting down on it, making the face look like an old Egyptian Pharaoh. Many people though didn't believe NASA, so on April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture of this mysterious face that was ten times sharper than all the previous pictures ever taken. When the photo was uploaded to the internet, thousands of people were disappointed when they found out that this was just a natural landform, not something alien made.

In conclusion, in the year of 1976, a face was spotted on the planet of Mars. This face was said to be the creation of aliens who were living on the planet. Many people were disappointed when they found out the truth. That this mysterious face was just a natural landform created over time. Even after NASA confirmed that this was just one ordinary landform, people still weren't convinced. So, on April 5,1998, an MOC team went out to Mars, and took pictures that were ten times sharper than all the originals. Thes pictures proved that this was just an ordinary landform that was formed over time. This "face" is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa her on earth found in the American West. Chief scientist for the NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says that the face found on the surface of Mars is actually about the same size as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.
