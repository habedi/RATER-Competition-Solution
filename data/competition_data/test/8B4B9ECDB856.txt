Venus, also known as the Evening Star. People now a day just know it as a world we can't reach or just anthor worthless plant.

Those claims are false and the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" tell you it all. The author's studys show that Venus is a world we need to explore becuse of the informatiom we can get from it. Also the chance of it being a second earth.

Yes Earth has a sister plant, but its not as good as people think. Venus is not in a condition for humans to live on, a human aircraft has not even been on the plant in over a decade. According to the aritcle " A think atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus" thoses number are not good for man. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any of the planets in our soler system. Atmospheric pessure for venus is 90 time greater then what we experience on our own plant. Yes venus is not a good place to live, but its a good place to explore and here is why.

Venus might be be a big gassed up plant but there are sighs of it looking like our plant once. Studys have shown Venus to have covered big oceans and forms of life. The plant still has it's rocky sediment that have features simlar to mountains, and valleys. Imagine if this was a plant like Earth, and think about how much we could learn from it. Mankind could learn about rocks and how things died so we can be ready for our plant when are dies. If we started to study Venus more in dept i feel like we could uncover more detail, about what came before us and how things happen.

All in all i feel like we need to study Venus just becuse there was once sign of life. The anwsers we could get would help our plant alot, becuse who know our plant might be like Venus one day.
