Dear principal,

I think you should let students bring cell phones to school as long as they don't use them during class time. If you let students bring there phones to school we will all be very happy. We promise not to use them during class .We will only use them for emergencies or for calling home for our lunch. Letting us bring our phones in school will also stop kids from bringing them in and using them and getting in trouble .

I know your probably getting tired of having to give people detentions . Trust me were tired of getting them. I know you care just as much about our education as we do .So let us bring our cell phones too school and quit suspending us for something as stupid as that. We think your the best principal this school has ever had. Please don't ruin that by outlawing cell phones.

Me i personally don't care but the student's i begging you too let us use our cell phones. We promise not to record fights or any thing like that .All we want is too be able too have our cell phones and use them. We wont use them during class. If a student gets caught using them in class you can stop letting us bring them to school.

So now you know why we want our cell phones. read this and think about it. Are cell phones really that big of a deal . All we do is text our friends . sometimes we use them for calling for lunch. So come on just think long and hard about this letter.
