Community Service

I think that not all kids in the school should do community service. I believe that, because some students don't even want to do class work. If some students don't even want to do class work, then how can they do community service. I think that there should be a group that does community service. More people would join the group if it's going to look good on their college applications. So if you make a group then it will be more successful then requiring it.

If you assigned every student to do community service, most people wouldn't know what to do. For example if someone wanted to tutor at an elementary school students and they didn't know how to contact the school and when the children would be available, and not end up doing it. A group would solve that problem, by have other people with you while doing the community service and you would know what to do.

You would also get the job done quicker. It would again be easier to start a group.

If everyone had to do community service for a certain amount of hours more people a day wouldn't complete their homework. The administration would have to work out a reasonable amount of minutes or hours. Kids when they get home also just relax and don't do anything, so again more homework and project would be incomplete if the school required community service. The shy students would be shy about talking to someone about doing community service.

If the school assigned community service it would be a bad idea.
