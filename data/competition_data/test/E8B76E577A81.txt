We all know how great of an invention the car was. But believe it or not you dont need it as much as you think. It causes stress, polluted air and your just better off with out it.

Vauban, Germany- residents of this community have gone to where few people would ever dare to enter; a car free suburban area. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother said "When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Living without a car can open up your eyes to the world like never before. You can bike ride on trails and paths to explore your city or suburb, just look at Columbia. They've also made changes to having no cars in their lives. They participate in their own car-free day. This day has now seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin America city. Being car-free for Columbia also means rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Furthermore, limitations on cars should be reduced because of the amount of greenhouse gases they cause which depletes our ozone layer and pollutes our air that we breath. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of emissions of greenhouse gases in Europe, and about 50 percent is areas that cars are frequently used in the United States. But its not just the US, even in France car emissions are polluting the air. Paris, had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in brussels and 79.7 in London. The main reason banned driving was because of the near-record pollution in the air.

The smog was so bad that is rivaled with Beijing and China which are known as the most polluted cities in the world.
