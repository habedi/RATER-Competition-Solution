Dear principal,

I believe as long as there are no issues with children and their cell phones there should be phone privileges.

So, I believe in policy 1. However I also believe there should be strict limits. I think that if one cannot live up to expectations needed ;the privilege shall be taken away. If the children can be mature enough, then give them it!

Why do I want this policy? I want this policy because very many teenagers, have recently quit school. Why? Because they don't like it! They might have stayed if there was a better social life in school. If they could have used cell phones, they just might have stayed. And nowadays there is a numerous amount of kids ruining their lives by dropping out of school.

My classmates are mature enough, and hold enough responsibility within them to have their cell phones. I bet, if you give them the policy ;they might only use it when necessary. They might even help each other in their education with the cell phones. They are getting older, wiser, more responsible by the second. This privilege might even determine people to come to school.
