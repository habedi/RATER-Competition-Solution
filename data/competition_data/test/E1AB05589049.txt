Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that students should perform community service because, It can help our town become a better place to be. It can clean up the grounds on which events are held, and the streets that people walk on.

I think students should perform community if they did something wrong.

Community service can be used for correction. For example in Raymond students have to perform community service when they do something wrong, with the law.

So community service can be used for punishment.

Community service can be used a extra credit too. Students can help with after school programs and tutoring. Students could be contributing to a positive situation by doing so. After all there are always students who could use extra help in school and other activities.

Community service could be used as a way for students to help the elderly or disabled in their community. They could rake leaves in the fall, or shovel snow in the winter. They could help with lawn and yard work in the summer. And because it's community service they wouldn't be getting paid.

Over all I think community service is a great idea. There are so many ways it could help the community. There should be programs in which people come together to clean up the school or the town grounds. So I think that students should perform community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
