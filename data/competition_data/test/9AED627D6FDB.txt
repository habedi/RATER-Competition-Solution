Doing Summer Projects the Right Way

At many high schools, a massive controversy is in the making. As the summer is right around the corner, students are getting prepared for their summer projects. These summer projects are in place to make sure the students never stop learning, and to make sure they are prepared for next year's class. The problem is if these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful.

The first reason why the summer projects should be student-designed is because they are easier to plan into the students' busy schedule. Everyone can agree that the summer time is went students are the busiest. Many go on vacations to foreign nations, visit families in other states, and the list goes on forever. By making the the projects student-designed, it gives the students the ability to look at what they got planned for the summer. The students then can make their projects fit around their schedule. If the project was teacher-designed, then the teacher would not know how to make it where it fits the busy schedules of the students. Therefore, these examples prove that it is better to have projects student-designed.

The second reason why it would be better to have student-designed projects is that it benefits the students more in several ways. Every student has a unique way of learning. Some students learn by listening. Others learn by using their eyes or by touch. By making these projects student-designed, the students can make them to where they can learn the most. An example would be if a visual learner had to make a project on the civil war, then he or she would make a presentation or anything that requires the eyes' engagement, helping them in the long run. If the project is teacher-designed, then the project will be made where it only benefits a small portion of the class. In conclusion, this shows that it benefits the students more to have student-designed projects.

The third reason why it would be beneficial for the students to have student-designed projects is because it is less stressful. by making the projects student-designed, the students know what they are getting into before the summer even begins. If the projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers might overload the students with a bunch of work thinking that it would be the best for the students. Students may have other projects to do for other classes, and this would make it hard for the students to put their best effort into the projects. Students may also have stress from problems not relating to school. An example would be a student who need to work over the summer to help pay the bills. He or she would prefer a project that is student-designed because it takes away that stress that would be with a teacher-designed project. Therefore, it would be a positive impact if the students got student-designed projects.

Many argue that teacher-designed projects would be better for the students. People claim that the teachers know their students well enough, that the students may design projects that are horribly made, or that teachers should have control over how the students learn. It might be true that teachers know their students really well, but the only person who knows the students the best are themselves. For the argument that projects will be horribly made, can be easily solved by having an outline which the students follow. They then make a project that follows that outline while making it their own way. These problems are also easily solved with the proof and evidence listed above, and it is clear that student-designed projects are ultimately better for the students.

In conclusion, because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful, summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. Teacher-designed projects hurt the students learning ability while student-designed projects help it. Now ask yourself if your children are learning to the best of their ability over the summer. Ask them if their summer projects are student-designed or teacher-designed. If they say that they have teacher-designed projects, make sure that problem is addressed knowing that it does not benefit your children in any way.Â
