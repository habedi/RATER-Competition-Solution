I dont agree that we should have driveless cars. There's a lot of things that can go wrong if we have driveless cars. It could malfunction on the road.

Would people get bored while the car is driving itself? Even if we wanted driveless, it would take years to test to make sure that it works properly so we dont have any casualties. How much money would all this technology cost? Will people be able to afford these cars? I think it's a good idea to have sensors, cameras, and alarms or vibrartions to alert the driver so there can be less accidents. I'm going to be discussing why I don't agree with drivless cars, what would happen if we got driveless cars, and what improvements could be on the cars.

I don't feel safe with driveless cars because when it comes technology anything can go wrong. It could malfunction and if it happens while your're on the road, you could be endangering yourself and those around you. To other people it made sound nice to relax while your car drives you, but I would feel safer if it was just me driving the car myself. I feel like the only reason people are coming up with driveless cars is because of how many accidents we get per year. Mostly because of people drinnking and driving or people texting and driving. If people would just focus on the road and not speed, we would not have so many accidents. That's the reason why I don't agree with driveless cars.

I think that we would probably have a lot of accidents if we have driveless cars. There has been times when technology just randomly malfunctions which can sometimes involve death. While your on the road something can wrong and you might not be able to do anything because you have no control over the car. We also got to think about how much all this technology would cost and would people be able to afford these cars. People might enjoy driving themselves and may not want a car driving them. People could get bored depending on their destination. There's not really much to say but that its's dangerous to use drivelss cars. If we were to use driveless cars, it would take a lot of testing and time to make sure its safe, but for now we can't really trust it until it has been properly tested.

I think it's a good idea to have a lot of technology on the car to make sure the roads are safe and we have less or no accidents. The idea of having sensors, alarms, and cameras because that can help us a lot to prevent accidents. If you're about to crash into a car it will have ana alarm to let you know you're about to hit a carpr have automatic brakes. The cameras can help you to see whose around you. This can help you when your making a turn or when you switch lanes. I agree with having improved cars but i don't agree on having driveless cars. Those are the improvements that the cars should have to help us to stay safe and drive better.

This is my opinion on what I think on driveless cars. I dont agree that we should have driveless cars and that we should just stick to the regular cars that we have right now. I talked about why we should'nt have driveless cars, what could happen if we have driveless cars, and what improvements should be on a car.
