Dear Principal,

Cell phones in school should not be aloud. I think they are a distraction to everyone around. Kids will think that since cell phones are aloud in school then they can use them whenever. But they can't. Some students don't follow the rules that often. Then on the other hand, some do. And that's a good thing but we can't count on every person in the school. They will be too worried about getting their phones out next period, they won't even pay attention in the class they are in at that time.

Teachers will get mad, then principals and sure enough students will. It will not be a good thing. I do not think Policy 1 is a very bright idea. This is for the students sake and a lot of the people in the building as well. Like I said, cell phones should not be aloud during school hours. Thank you for your time to read my letter. I hope you consider with my reasoning.
