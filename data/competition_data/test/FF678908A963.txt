How would a student feel if they were able to attend classes from home? Happy? Or sad? In the 21st Century, people around the world are surrounded by possibilities, like online school, which could advance themselves as human beings. Attending online school will increase the level of security for students and staff, it will advance a students' studies, and will create an outlet for students to better express themselves.

When people oppose this idea of having online school, they tend to argue the fact that, students attending these classes from home will be socially undeveloped. Though this is a possibility among the few, opposers of this idea have to look at the great benefits to having schools of this domain available: a child will not experience physical bullying; students are able to learn more material by asking questions in an environment they know is safe; staff and students will be able to learn and grade at a pace that is best to meet their deadline for assignments.

Having to attend classes from home will greatly benefit both parties of students and staff. Over the past years, there have been multiple school shootings that happen randomly. Whether these shootings have to deal with personal or academic problems, schools can never ensure that a student nor a teacher will be safe at all times. To better make sense of things, being able to attend school from home could mean that a student will have a lower fatality rate because of the higher level of security they have at their home. Being a student who takes a virtual course, having the opportunity to learn at home means that I can keep my guard down and not have to worry about school shooters of any kind.

To further add on to the benefits, being able to attend classes from home could mean that a student can advance in their studies. Since a student is not on a strict schedule, they can set themselves up for success by establishing their own. When teaching with a physical class, teachers are inhibiting a students' success by holding up the class to answer questions instead of continuing with the planned lesson. Having the flexibility to speed up and slow down in a course could mean a great deal to the success of a students' future.

Similarly to advancing in their studies, students will also be able to foster an outlet where they will be better at expressing their emotions and social skills. Surrounded by their family members and neighbors, a student can better prepare themselves for the real world by applying new skills they learn by attending classes from home. For example, if a student were to take a Public Speaking course online from home, they will be better adapted to their environment, and will be able to perform at their best because they acknowledge the encouragement their family members and neighbors give to them.

Life grants people of all backgrounds the possibility to grow. People of the contemporary world should not be afraid of modernity or advancement for their children. There is only one life to live, and it is best to revel in it, which is justifies the notion that students would in fact benefit from being able to attend classes from home.
