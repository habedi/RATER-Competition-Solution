The author talks about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it presents many dangers to human life and machines. The author supports their idea of pursuing Venus despite the dange very well because he talks about human curiosity, the machines that have been and could be used to get to Venus, and why Venus has been considered to be explored.

First, the author talks about human curiosity about the planet Venus. The author finishes the article off by talking about human curiosity and how this helps shape the world today (paragraph 8). This shows that human curiosity is important in peoples lives because it has allowed mankind to create many different things to help people explore the unknown, like the moon, and can be used to explore many different planets humans have looked at for centuries. The article also talks about how researches want to talk "samples of rock, gas, or anything else..."(paragraph 6). This demonstrates human curiosity because mankind wants to discover unknown secretes about plantets and wants to enrich our knowledge on the known universe and taking samples will help unlock these secretes.

Secondly, the article talks about what machine have been used and what machines could be used to help explore Venus. The article starts off by saying "No space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours...[because] the plantets surface is 800 degrees Fahrenheit" (paragraph 2-3). This gives an insite on how the planets surface is because it is so hot that all the space craft humans have sent to Venus have been destroyed because of the extreamly hot temperatures. However, later in the article the author talks about how NASA has thought about creating a blimp that could float over storms and ground of Venus (paragraph 5). This shows that a blimp could be used to find secretes and help humans discover the planet that people have been gazing up to for centuries.

Finally, the author discusses why Venus want to be explored. The author talks about how Venus resembles Earth very closely and refers to it as "Earth's Twin"(paragraph 2). Venus has been called "Earth's Twin" which means it has some qualities similar to Earth. People now want to discover if other planets were ever like earth or if they could sustain human life. People want to explore Venus because they want to see if it could sustain life like Earth. Also the article talks about how Venus has "familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters" (paragraph 4). Since Venus has familiar features it is a prime area to explore because human's maybe able to find a new planet that is habitial and create colonies.

In conclusion the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because he talks about human curiosity, the machines that could be used, and why people want to explore Venus. Human curiosity supports this because humans have wanted to unlock the secretes of the universe for generations and exploring Venus may help in this quest. The machines that could and have been used is a way human's could find these secretes. Why people want to explore Venus is not just for the secretes it could possess but also because it is similar to Earth in many ways and is even called its twin. Venus could help mankind find out what they have wanted to know since the beginnig of time and Venus should be explored despite the dangers to help solve these secretes.
