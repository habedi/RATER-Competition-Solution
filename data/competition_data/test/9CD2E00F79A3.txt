Dear TEACHER_NAME every day we, us students site in hard chairs all day and so do you and you hat that 8 hours a day 5 days a week 7 classes we at leas need a break from math, reading, and specially history so let us out and have freedom and you could rehire all of the pe teachers and you now some of them are teachers to and love working with kids at barwise 1 really good reosn is to get a good exercise and not get fat and let the teachers have a 45 min break from us. Are parents make use have choir's and wear stuck in a room all day long and cant get fresh air and boys would want to be football players and have a good record when in collage's for job to do what they want to do. You could lose a lot of your students to other schools and are not going to be a principal and close the school down for what you have done.

sincerely STUDENT_NAME.
