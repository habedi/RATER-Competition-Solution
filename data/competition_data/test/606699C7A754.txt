Dear, principal

I think community service is good. You can clean up trash other people don't care there litter. it is also nice because instead of doing what you would normally do you can go outside and clean up. or help with the city like cleaning public spaces

Another reason community service is good is that you can be active and go outside instead of like playing video games or watching television. i would want more people to get outside and know how much it would help doing community service

I would want to do community service for two reasons getting outside because its summer and just to help the city. listen the more people pollute the more disgusting that city/town would look like it could even be an entire state. recess is not something kids need so replace it with community service you can get those kids out of school and you can teach them how important it is not to throw trash on the ground and teach them pick it up if they see it on the ground. i would like too see more people doing this it will help the earth become a little more trash free.

the more people who do this will make it even better. also the people who don't do this will be the ones who get shame on them. So i want your opinion on if this will be established or not. most people cant say they helped the world but these students can. community service is the right thing to do for all these good thing.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
