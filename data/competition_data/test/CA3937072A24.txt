I think that policy 1 is the better choice, because the students are going to bring their phones to school no matter what. If you let us bring our phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free periods the students wouldn't have to sneak around and text people during class. Some people might take advantage of this and use the phones all day long but, you would just have to punish them and let the rest of us use them in free periods. The school will then get more respect and the teachers could teach their class without any distractions and cellular devices going off in class. If you would consider that policy the students would admire you in ways you can` t seem to understand. Giving students the opportunity to carry their cellular devices is giving them responsibility and telling them that you can trust them to do the right things in class and pay attention to the class.

To prevent the students from texting in class the teachers should also put bens or cubbies to hold all cellular devices. That would restrain the students to look at texts from their friends. If you tell students not to bring their cellular devices to school they are going to bring them any way or the other just to see what you are going to do about it. The mind of a teenager is if you tell us not to do something we are going to do it anyways just to see what's going to happen if we do it. If nothing happens we will continuously keep doing it and will eventually start using the phones in class and wherever we want and when we want to.

What i` m trying to say is that if you tell a student not to bring a phone to school is like telling a teacher not to teach on a subject that contains the lesson that the class will be learning for the week. So, you should really consider having the first policy.
