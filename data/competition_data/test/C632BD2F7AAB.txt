The principal has stated that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity can be best defined as an activity that does not have to do with main school subjects, these can be sports, clubs, etc. Having an extracurricular activity can be very beneficial to students and teachers alike. People can join clubs, sports, or student committees which can help the school run smoothly and possibly even get it awards, if the teams do well. It can help the teachers refine the way they teach and help the students learn in an improved way. Finally, this can help the students in many ways, such as giving them more social skills, getting help in a subject they need help in, helping to find a new skill, or helping to nurse and grow a current skill.

The first way that having extracurricular activities is helpful and beneficial to students is the fact that these can help grow social skills. Many people in school don't really talk to others, they mainly stay either focused on their studies or on their personal problems, this leaves them open to bullying or, worse even mental health problems such as depression. This is because they feel that no one gets them and that they are all alone in school, being in a club, however, could let them talk to other people and spill their feelings about problems. Even if they feel that their problems are their own business, they could talk about things that they do in their free time, what games they play, hobbies, or views on certain subjects. Even if people don't have problems, they could be solely focused on learning and not talking to people, because they may feel that this is just a mere distraction from what is truly important. However, these people need to talk to people so that they don't develop depression or worse mental illnesses, which is where a club or social group could help.

Another way that this can be beneficial is in the field of academics. Many people in school are very talented, but they just don't understand a certain subject or problem, and teachers have many other students to worry about, so they may end up missing them. This could make the struggling student feel resentful, and start making them feel that the teacher doesn't care and that they should just give up, since there is no one to help, especially if their parents are too busy or if they don't seem to care. If they were to join a study club, things could change, someone else in the club could step up and help, better yet a teacher could help the student and they could help solve the problem and possibly even change the way they teach to help more students understand a particularly difficult topic. Going to this study club could also help people who are more focused on studies talk to other people or teach them, because it's said that you don't truly know something until you teach it, so this could be a learning experience for both sides.

The final way that this program can benefit the school would be it could let students find new athletic skills. More and more people now have started to just sit around and play video games or look at social media, this means that there is a higher risk of obesity in younger generations, it also means that they aren't getting enough sunlight to keep their bodies healthy. Despite many people thinking that saying this is just an excuse to get them outside, sunlight actually gives us the vitamin D we need to survive, so joining a sports team or even a hiking club can let people become more fit and healthy, and it could let them talk to people face to face, instead of over a chat, which will make them know that this is a real person, and someone their age who can be interested in the same things as them. For someone who wants to try out for something, but doesn't know if they have the skill, they could join a small club and practice for a sport to grow their skills. This could also let a person learn something new about themselves, such as finding a new ability that they didn't know they had, which could inspire self confidence in them. Along with that, this could lead to an influx of talented people which could help the sports teams out and potentially even lead them to championships which would give the school large amounts of recognition.

As stated in the above three points, the principal's new plan is a very good idea that can be beneficial for all parties involved. Having at least one extracurricular activity lets students be fit and healthy, and it could also let them socialize, build confidence, and work on schoolwork at the same time. Along with that, it could allow students who are already knowledgeable about something test how much they really understand it. This could also let teachers refine the ways they teach their subjects and also identity who might need more help than others which could let them do their job in a much better way. This project could help the school because if the students are getting higher scores and the teachers are doing a better job at teaching, then it could get the school more recognition. All of these would ultimately lead to a school that is vastly superior to others.
