"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerous it presents. I think the author supports it's idea ok but not enough for somebody to risk their life to go and study it. The author really doesn't use that many details for this idea.

Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky right? So why wouldn't you wanna go and study venus I know I would. That's why the author want you to go study it. He is basically telling you all this information about Venus and all these stuff it has. Like,I didnt even know venus was aa planet until I saw it in the text."Venus is actually a planet". Exploring venus is life risking cause its so close to the sun but also close to Earth.

The author really give alot of supports about studying venus in the text. Lik he really only talked about a venus is close to earth and thee sun. He doesnt really give good supports to his idea. But also the author is giving som supports on how its worthy to study. Like nobody has ever actually stayed alive on venus more than a few hours on venus so what if you do you would be the first to ever alive on venus more than a couple hours hours. Would you wanna take a chnce of your life to visit venus?

In my conclusion I actually think the author can get away with this for other readers to go and study venus. Even though he gives a little supports but not enough.
