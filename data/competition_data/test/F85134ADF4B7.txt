Dear state senator,

I think that we should get ride of the elecoral college because its not what people want. The popular votes lets you pick which president you want. The electoral college is when you pick your candidate but your picking a elector and they bring in the votes. The people that vote should be able to pick who they want and then yea. So we should have popular votes then keeping the electoral college. So we need a popular vote and not a electoral college where you dont actually vote, you vote for a elector and then you tell them which candidate you vote for and then they bring in the votes. For exaple, if i would to say that the candiadates are George washington and john kerry and i pick george and 34 others pick him the elector would bring 35 votes to the congress and then he would have 35 votes. You dont know the electors you dont know anything.
