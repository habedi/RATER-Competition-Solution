Principal this letter is for an school policy for using cell phones during school hours. I think that the first policy needs to be accepted that one that says "Allow students to bring phones to school and use it at lunch and in free times. However they must be turn of during class periods or studing ". Because what happens if the parents of the student cannot come to school and the student grandma house its close to the school the parents can called them and tell him that go walking to his grandma house. The other reason is that if it is an emergency in the school you can call 911 or your parents to come to the school.

Plus what happens when you are trap in something dangerous and nobody can hear you and you just have your phone you can call somebody that can help you get out of their. That's

Why we want the phones that can be use during free time for emergency and caution so I telling you that make phones free to use during lunch time and free time only

I hope that you accept my offer.

sincercly, your student
