Smog. Gas. Pollution. Many countries dont allow for people to have cars because they destroy the air that they are breathing.

In Elisabeth Rosenthal's passage it says that "Passenger cars are responisble for 12%(percent) of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe..... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. In Europe forbidding car use it is drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Over the past couple of decades, maybe even centries we have been centered around the automobile that has effected out health and daily lives because of the increase of pollution.

Also, the streets in Europe are not as crowded as the streets in the United States. Paris, more smog than any other European capital, has began to enforce a partial banning of cars to help clear the cities air. Cars that run off of diesel gas tend to create more pollution than cars that run off of regular gas. Sixty-five percent(%) of France's vehicles are fueled with diesel gas. By limiting the usage of these cars they will be contributing to the decrease of gas in the air. The increase of pollution has created a solution to help and decrease polluted air by making plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars that are able to transport more than one person at a time.
