Less cars are getting sold on a yearly basis, which is trimendously changing everything in the world. Countries have started noticing when the polution rate spiked up, causing people to make a change. Stated in the fist article "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe"(Elisabeth Rosenthal). This is saying that in just Europe alone cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

The people did not react as you would expect. After noticing the statistics of the rise of problems cars make, they where actually exited for the change "As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"(Heidrum Walter). What is being mentioned in this statement is that hardly and of the people that live in Vauban do not own a car and they are happy about it. Now because of situation like this people are going for a more healthier alternitive like walking and biking to there destination.

In some places it is now starting to become a law like in Paris "motorist wih even-numberd license plates were orderd to leav their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day" (Robert Duffer). In the begining that law did not go well with most drivers. About 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. In Bogota it was the third straight year cars have been banned, only allowing buses and taxis and the violators will face a $25 fine. But although some residents do not mind "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution" (Carlos Arturo).

Now auto mobil companies are looking at the stats and seeing that every year their sales are lowering because of the changes going on. Now fewer people are starting to care about getting their licence to drive. The world is changing for he better.
