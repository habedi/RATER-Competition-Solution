Since the internet was first created and put in schools, there has been a debate on whether schools should allow students to attend classes online. This debate has been going on for years but the answer is simple: yes. Giving students the oppurtunity to attend online classes can be very benefical.

Online classes would make school more affordable for others, people would be able to go to any school they like, and it lets people learn at their own pace.

Online classes would give people a chance to go to school because it would be more affordable. When I was a freshman my friend, Generic_Name, dropped out of school because her family could no longer afford for her to go. Online schooling could have prevented that from happening. Attending school online is significantly cheaper than actually going to school; people don't have to worry about paying for school supplies, school fees, or lunch because they aren't actually going to school.

For families, like Generic_Name's, this is very benefical because their kids can continue to go to school and they won't have to worry about whether they can afford it or not. Online classes wouldn't just make schools more afforable, but it would also let people go to any school they choose.

Usually when someone starts going to school they go to the school they are zoned for, but online classes would give people the ability to go to whatever school they like. When I was in middle school, I was zoned for a school that had wasn't accredited and had a bad reputation. My parents had tried to find others schools, but I couldn't go to those because I wasn't in the school district. Eventually, they found a better school that I could actually attend because that school offered classes online. Online schooling allowed me to attend a better school even though I wasn't in that zone. Online classes can give people the chance to a better education by giving students the oppurtunity to attend any school they like; this could allow kids to escape a poor school district for a better one. Not only does it allow you to attend any school you want, but a person can learn at their own pace.

Not everybody can learn things at the same rate with online classes people can learn at their pace. My bestfriend, Generic_Name, took online classes until she got into highschool. Since she was taking classes online she didn't have worry about learning information in certain amount of time. If she didn't understand something she take as much time as she wanted until she figured it out. Online classes allowed her to graduate early because she had already earned all her credits. Having the ability to learn at your own pace can be very benefical. People can go as fast as they want or as slow as they want.

Online schooling come with many benefits that schools should consider like how affordable it makes school, that it's a self-paced program, and allows students to attend any school.

Though some people may say actaully going to school is more benefical because kids learn how to socialize; People can learn how to socialize just as well outside of school as inside. With online schooling people can have a chance at a better education which could better their future. Schools need consider the new wave of oppurtunties that could be given to their students with online classes.
