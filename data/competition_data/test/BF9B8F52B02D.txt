The Face on Mars is a natural landform made of huge rocks. There is no such thing as aliens people just started a story or rumor about living human beings on mars with green flesh and a big oval head and small body. They even took closer pictures of it to find out what it really was and went slower by it to get a better angle an view and it was no living creature.

People who heard about the face on mars assumed it was aliens because of what people told them instead of listening to NASA and what they had to say about it. Even a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact. So on April 5, 1998, when Mars global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time ever Michael Malin and his (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

But not everyone was satisfied with the pictures because the face on mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was April '98 a cloudy time of year so they went took it again April 8, 2001 a cloudless day in Cydonia and they took pictures very close up. And what the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of a butte or mesa.
