Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that students should be allowed to participate in sports and other extra curricular activities with a grade lower than a "B" average. In some classes, a "B" is hard to earn. Many students earn a "C" in a lot of classes. According to our grading system, a "C" is average. Students should be allowed to participate in sports or other extra curricular activities with a "C" average, here are some reasons why.

As i stated before, according to our educators a "C" is an average grade, and anything above that, is above average. A lot of kids earn a letter "C" and if we didn't let them participate in extra curricular activities or sports, they might use their time for other things. If we don't let them participate, they might turn to drugs, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Most kids with lower grades are also more likely to be the kids who take drugs, drink alcohol, or use other harmful substances.

Furthermore, we don't want any child to feel left out. If a boy or girl isn't allowed to participate in sports or other activities, they might feel like they are different, or that no one wants them. Also, many students meet new people or friends on sports teams. A child may feel different from his friends if he cannot participate in after school activities. Another big issue, is the fact that the kids who are allowed to participate may bully, or make fun of the kids who aren't. Bullying is a big issue at our school and if we set standards to where you have to have a "B" average or above more bullying incidents will occur.

Lastly, school is the last chance many people may have to play sports, or join after school activities. We don't want to take away a child's chance to understand the pure joy of winning, the sadness of losing, and the rush you feel in the middle of the competition, when it is you against someone else. Sports or extra curricular activities is a good way for students to release anger, and maybe lose some of there competitive drive they might show toward others in the classroom. They will also show that sports is a good way to see how other communities work. If they travel to a school less fortunate then we are, they may feel that they need to volunteer, or donate. That would really help our community.

All in all, we shouldn't take away sports because a student has a grade point average lower than a "B." It would lead to students making bad decisions, or them getting bullied. Also, sports help kids vent their anger in a healthy, competitive manner. In sports or other activities, kids will meet new friends, or see communities that need help, and they may volunteer in our communities. In conclusion, a "C" is average and a student with lower than a "B," which is an above average grade, should be allowed to participate in sports.
