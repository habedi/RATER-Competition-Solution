Are your kids really safe in school? In my personal opinion, most of the parents in the U.S expect their kids to be in a safe place, when we talk about attending to school. But they are really not safe in school; Due to bullying, bad influences and gangs, or even worst; the schools shootings, that lately have been occurring more often in different states. In solutions to this, some schools are offering distance learning, which means; attending classes from home. This program make students able to take classes online or in a video conferencing and make parents in a certain way feel less carefree and able to have their kids safe at home as well. However, attending classes from home will totally cause a beneficial impact for students and parents. Additionally, if they take advantages of this opportunity by obtaining excellent grades, there will not be any obstacle for them to graduate earlier, than the regular students that currently attend to a public or private school.

To start with, bullying, bad influences, for example: (smoking, selling drugs, and fighting), and gangs are now unfortunately parts of the schools, which affect the students that are really looking forward to success in school and the schools shootings that have taken the life of many other kids; puts on risk your kids' safety and life as well.

Secondly, making your kids be part of a distance learning program, will give you the opportunity to have them safe at home, being taking care of by a babysitter or a family member who you trust, putting their safety in first place brings benefit for them and you as a parent.

Even thought, there's people who would never let their kids receive classes from home; they think people who choose that method are clumsy or smart less, because, they want their kids to interact with others and work as a team with others kids.

In conclusion, parents should concede their kids the option to be part of a distance learning program that permit students to attend classes from home and that will be super benefit for them and their parents, because the safety of your kids is the most important thing.
