to start off, having sports or other activities is a necessity. why? because many students like to do art, music, sports, dance, culinary, etc. things in that nature, but these students may not have a B average in all there classes. who knows, maybe in these activities they would have higher then an A average in one of these classes. may opinion about changing the policy is not to change it. many kids will be disappointed and probably some wont come to school anymore. students who love what they do and they have a class in school where they can do what they love to do. they will show more effect in there work and abilities due to the passion they have. in my opinion. you should leave how to the policy is and let the students who have a C average have sports or other activities because maybe way of the students may want one of these activities as there career. many reason that can occur is that some students may need the fitness in sports so that they can stay healthy and lose weight. many students who love or like to draw need art class so that they can develop more skills and abilities in drawing and move forward if they want it as a career. probably students in dance would need it also so that there skills and abilities develop also.. all of these reason about because many students want the policy to stay how it is and not to lose what they love or like doing in school.
