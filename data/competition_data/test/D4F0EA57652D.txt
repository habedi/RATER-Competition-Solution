Principal:

Being a student at our school, I think that it is a wise decision that you have made to only allow students with a B average or above to participate in sports or other such activities. Here are the reasons: students will have to work harder in school, they will get rewarded for their efforts, be more conscientious students, and therefore be able to better contribute to your school.

Students that have good grades are the ones that coaches want for their teams. I have learned this personally and think that if you are a student with good grades you are more likely to work harder in their sport or other activities as well. Getting a B average may not be easy for all of these students, but if they truly want to play the sport or do the activity they will want to put in the effort to get the grades needed to participate.

If students get a B average it is more likely that they will excel in their extracurricular areas, because it will be rewarding after getting good grades. Playing on sports teams has shown me that the kids who are willing to work hard at school are also willing to work hard in their sport or other talent area that they may have. This is another reason that implementing this rule is a good idea.

The school will also benefit from this change by having more conscientious students in its walls. If students have to be pushed mentally, they will be more willing to be pushed physically. I think that having better students will also translate into better athletes and kids in other activities.

In closing, I would just like to say that I agree whole-heartedly with your decision to only let students with a B average or higher participate in sports or other activities. As shown throughout this letter, I think that our school will benefit greatly from this and will grow not only academically, but in our other areas. I hope that other schools will follow our lead and raise the standard for grades in schools nationwide.

Your conscientious student:
