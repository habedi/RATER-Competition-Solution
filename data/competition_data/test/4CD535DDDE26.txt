Dear Principle,

I have heard that you are considering a change in the schools cell phone policy. I think that this is a good idea. Kids will always use their phones in school, and there is no way that you will be able to catch them every time. Its just not possible! I personally think that you should go with Policy one, Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I think that this is the best thing to do because then kids can have time to get their texting in, kids can text and call in free time instead of doing other bad things, and kids wont be texting in class.

Kids will have time to text in other times of the day with this policy.

(Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) Allowing children to text during lunch will get that "urge" out to communicate. Then, kids will not have that feeling during class. If they get the feeling during class, then they will text in class. This is because teachers are paying more attention to teaching then what the kids are doing (which is good and bad) but it is just what happens. If kids don't feel the urge to communicate then they wont have to text during school hours, or in class.

Another reason is because kids can text, or call during lunch and free time, instead of doing "criminal things" like graffiti. If kids are busy communicating then they will not have the time, or feeling to do bad things. If they are communicating maybe they will feel like someone will find out if they do those things. Over all, kids will be paying more attention to their phones to what things they can do to ruin the school community.

My last reason for choosing option one, is because kids will not text in class because they already did. Texting in class will go down a lot, and who cares if kids text in lunch? it's not disrupting anyone from anything, except eating. If kids choose not to eat then who cares, its their choice.

So this is why I think that option one is better. Kids can have time to get their texting in, kids can text and call in free time instead of doing other bad things, and kids wont be texting in class. So choose option number one, and allow children to text in lunch and other free time.
