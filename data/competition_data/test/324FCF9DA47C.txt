Imagine, going to a school where everyone was sad, and there were not any activities to do. It doesn't sound very nice. Well, this is what is going to happen if students do not participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, you could join a sport, work on the yearbook, serve on the student council, and many more. There is something for everyone, so don't be afraid to try new things. Students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved in their school, and is a chance to make new friends.

Studies show that 95% of people that join an after school activity are happier and healthier than those that don't. My brother, Generic_Name, became happier and healthier after joining a sport. Not only did he stay in shape, but his mental health improved tremendously. This all happened because he decided to try out for football. Most people are too afraid to try something new, so they won't. That is why if they are required to join something or try out they might find something that they are really good at. So, next time you are too scared to do something just remember that you won't know until you try.

Next, participating in an extracurricular activity makes for a more involved student body. When, you play a sport or join a club you are showing some school spirit. School spirit makes school fun and enjoyable for both staff and students. When, school is fun you are more likely to join another club or sport, which improves your school spirit more. It is just a big chain reaction and the result is an involved student body. To start the chain reaction you have to make it a requirement to join an extracurricular activity. Yes, the students might be hesitant at first, but they'll love coming to school and participating in things in the end. These things will also improve grades, so the students will be involved and they will improve academically. All of these things make for a more involved student body.

Finally, nine times out of ten people meet their lifelong friends through after school activities. Generic_Name, my sister, participated in several things; including, cheer leading, tennis, FCCLA, production, and track. She met all of her friends through extracurricular activities. Even though, she is almost out of college now, she is still friends with all of them. By putting herself out there she has made friends that she'll keep forever. This also goes back to before, Participating in a sport makes you healthy and happy. Generic_Name became happier, healthier, and involved. Now it is your turn, so will you?

I believe that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved, and is a chance to make new friends. Students may want to play a sport, but they can't because they are not enough people. Or, a classmate wants to try out but they feel as though they aren't good enough. We need to encourage students to participate in something greater than themselves. By making it a requirement to participate in something, they will not be as scared to do it. So, now that you know all of the benefits, will you join an extracurricular activity?
