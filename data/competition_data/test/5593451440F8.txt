The majority of students have to walk the dreadful halls of one's school everyday for seven hours to receive an education, but some schools offer students the option to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from this because students would potentially gaining more free time, avoid social conflicts, be more successful in the classroom, and have a healthier lifestyle.

By the time students arrive at school and by the time students departure, morning has passed into late afternoon. One reason why students would benefit from classes at home would be the potential extra free time students would gain. If classes were attended at the comfort of home, students could work at one's own pace which means each student could design what time class starts and finishes which would allow students to be more active in ones community, make more time for relationships, and have more time to find ones passions.

The classroom can be negative space filled with hate and social conflicts. Although school classrooms touch on these negative topics, which can relate to real world problems that can help a student cope with hate, students would overall still benefit from class at home. Not all students have the same values or personalities which can lead to students exchanging hateful words to one another which could put ones mental state and self confidence at risk. If classes were attended at home, students lives would benefit by avoiding unnecessary hate and potentially have a more stable mindset and happier life.

A majority of students lives in a school's classroom is a 25:1 ratio, which means students do not receive as much attention from teachers as one should. If classes were online or through video conferencing, it would benefit student's academic life because the student would directly contact the teacher and not have to fight for the teacher's attention, which would result in being more successful in the classroom.

Since the school day begins so early, it has effected the sleeping schedules of students which is effecting students efficiency in and outside the classroom. Another reason why students lives would benefit from class at home would be that since the student could design ones schedule, that extra time could not only benefit students social lives but, also their sleep schedule, which would result in a healthier life style. Alongside sleep, what is put into ones body also effects ones mood and work efficiency. Some students simply do not have time in the morning to pack ones lunch, which results in those students purchasing school lunch which majority of the time consists of chips and french fries which does to give the body the right energy or those students do not eat at all. If classes were attended at home students would be able to eat healthy lunches which benefit the health of students allowing students to have more energy to focus on ones schoolwork and passions.

In conclusion, schools should offer students the option to attend class at home because it will benefit the lives of the students by potentially gaining free time, avoiding social conflicts, being more successful in the classroom, and having a healthier style which will potentially make students lives improve while still receiving an education.
