Most parents nowadays always say, 'Get ready and go to school'. But is that really the case in modern day. As we humans evolve, their is always new technological advances and changes that come. For example, Bill Gates with Apple products and Steve Jobs with Microsoft. These two men pioneered modern day technology. But how does this correlate with school? A lot actually, those two men influenced the creation of Google, and with Google, comes Google Classroom, which is what a lot of schools and teachers use for teaching. Online school, and even video conferencing, is made much easier with Google Classroom, and is an essential piece to a proper education, without needing to go to school.

Google Classroom is one of the leading sites that schools use to teach and keep in touch with their students. Google Classroom makes it super easy for any student to follow up to date with the class. Online schooling is the same as actually going to school, by that it means that the student can get the same education by staying at home compared to go to school.

With a proper mindset any student can to online school. Many people argue that online schooling is bad because students will not pay attention and actually retain the information. But the thing is, the same can be said for going to school. For example, lets say a student that is not productive and lazy was to go to school, he would accomplish little to nothing, and then lets say that same student did online schooling, he would accomplish little to nothing. And then vise verse, if a really hard working and productive student was to go to school, he would accomplish a lot of his work , and then in online schooling he would accomplish a lot. See, it depends on the student and their productiveness and not whether they go to school or if they stay at home and do online schooling.

Going to school is argued to be a leading factor in a child being stress, having anxiety, or always being tired. With online schooling it will allow you to do the work when you can. This will help students have less anxiety and get more sleep. Most students can argue that going to school for long periods of time (i. e. eight hours, 5/7 days of the week) is very tiring. You also have to factor in the students homework assignments and tests, relationships and extracurricular activities. All of that piles up and can cause large amounts of stress, at least for going to school. At home, you will be given the same assignments, but given more freedom of when to do them.

But many parents and teacher argue that the student needs to go to school, and their is nothing wrong with that. Schools are a great place for a kid to make new friends and find out who they are, especially at a young age. Going to school also allows for a more hands on experience (ex. science classes based on projects). And for some students, a hands on experience is what they need. Some students are just better learners when it comes to hands on experiences.

In conclusion, you can get the same education from online school when compared to going to school. Online schooling offers the same education as going to school, thanks to the help of Google Classroom. A proper mindset is what is needed when doing online school, so that you can stay productive and do your work. Staying at home and doing work, is what will help build a students positive life, without the negative effects of stress and anxiety. Will all this information, do you prefer online schooling or going to school?
