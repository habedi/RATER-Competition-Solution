For some people having a car is a neccesity, but for others it can just be stressful. I believe it is much safer with out cars. There would be less accidents ,

less pollution and it would save people a lot of money .

In Paris they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the smog. If there were drivers out on the road they got fined. This didnt stop everyone, there was counts of 4,000 people being fined for driving. Just five days after the partial ban congestion went down 60 percent.

Just Imagine if five days of no driving caused congestion to go down 60 percent, how much would it go down if cars were eleminated all together.

There are some disadvantages to not having a car. Such as not being able to get where you need to go on time, biking or walking far places, getting sweaty before work or school ect.

Driving can also be very stressful, for example when businessman Carlos said "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,". This statement suggest that it is stressful to drive a car.

In conclusion, I would definitally want to have a car so i could get where i needed to go on time. I would also like to reserve the car only if i really needed to use it.
