Limiting car usage can really save this earth we contribute to destroying everyday. Cars let off a gas called carbon monxide that gets trapped in the warm air layer and contaminates the air we breath in every second of the day. Paris came up with a clever way to limit the air pollution in a week by having motorists with even numbered license plates not drive on Mondays, and if cars with even numbered license plates drove on that day they would be find $31. This would have also went for odd numbered licenses plates on the following day. Vaunban, Germany has also tried something to limit air pollution from motor vehicles. They have a suburban area where no cars are allowed to drive. "Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the french and swiss borders" Elisabeth Rosenthal said. Other ideas have been made in making a car free day. Andrew Selsky stated that "Bogota, Columbia- In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams".

There is so much good that can come from a limitation on the use of cars everyday. A big factor is the obesity rate that is climbing in the US. This is a good way to get ppl to excerise without telling them to actually do it. If there was a resriction of car use then it will get people to make decisions like to i want to get find or am i just gonna walk to the store and get what i need, and they will most likely take the path of no fine. This move to limit car use can do so more than the obvious reducing of air pollution. It can also reduce the amount of money spent to other countries for oil and gas which can go to things that are more important like our countries education for kids. If you really take the time to thing about the benfits that can come from this you will come to alot more than whats in front of you this will set of a chain reaction to alot of other things that will help us and the earth at the same time. Elisabeth Rosenthal said "And that, experts say, is a huge imediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissins from tailpipes.... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissins in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

Elisabeth Rosenthal noticed that "when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995". "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"said Michael Sivak. This just goes to show that we are gonna end up one day coming close to barely any cars on the road why dont we start now.

Cars are a luxury and not a necessity and we are really abusing it right now. I know you may think what about when you got to go a couple miles just to get to a grocery store. well they have already thought about that Elisabeth Rosenthal stated, "while there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs.... Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular squaer mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life". So thing about this and be open mind to new ways in making the world a more healtier place. You can't walk a thousand miles if you dont take a single step.       Â
