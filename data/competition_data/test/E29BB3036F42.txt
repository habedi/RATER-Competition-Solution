Dear principal,

I think you should make it a requirement to all students to provide at least 100 hours of community service because if we were all to go downtown and pick up a full large bag of garbage from the streets our town would be much more cleaner and nicer.

I also think it would be a good idea to visit the elderly a couple times and maybe read to them or play a board game with them.

If the elderly don't have anyone to talk to or play with the last years of their life they` re going to die sad and lonely.

What we can also do is have people and students walked around the school and look for trash then we can have a cleaner school.

And I think you should make it a grade to do because if students think they can stay home and do nothing while other student go and do the work then they` re wrong.

Imagine if no one cleaned the streets and just left them like that with McDonald and Burger King wrappers on the ground.

the streets would look like a total wasteland and junkyard all pilled with millions of peoples trash.

If we live in them don't you think it` s our responsibility to clean them and take care of them.

If students walk the streets and go to the stores and buy candy and food then leave the trash on the ground instead of taking two steps the garbage can in front of you.

I also think we should put garbage cans out on every block so people can put their garbage into.

This is why you should make it a requirement to serve at least 100 hours of community service.

Sincerely, Anonymous
