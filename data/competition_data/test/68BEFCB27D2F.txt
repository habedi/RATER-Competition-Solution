Dear Principal,

I am a student at your school, and I have noticed that you have produced two policies about phones in school. I have a cell phone myself, and I am responsible with it. I would have to say that I would choose Policy One, because Policy Two is a bit extreme, and here is why.

First, I agree that cell phones shouldn't be used during class, but I think it's fine to use them during free time. For instance, during lunch, you are trying to find your friend. You can simply send them a text message to ask where they are, and you can find them easier. Or if you just want to say hello to your parents, it will be okay. If you put Policy Two into effect, then students won't be able to do any of those things. For many students, phones are important to them, and if they can't use them during school then what's the use?

Second, say that you need a ride home after school. If you choose Policy One, then students will be able to call their parents and ask for a ride. If you choose Policy Two, then students will have to use the office phone, and that could be a hassle and take a while. Also, if you walk home, you can call your parents and say that you are on your way home and tell them about your day. Student's parents would like to know that their children are safe and are done with school.

Finally, students can talk to each other. For example, between classes, it would be nice to just say hi to a friend that is in a different class, who you don't see often. They can also be used to check the time, and to also sometimes use the dictionary or calculator on it. As you can see, they can sometimes be helpful.

These are examples of how I think phones should be allowed during free time and lunch, but not during classes. I hope that this essay will convince you to choose Policy One and not Policy Two. I am sure that most students would also agree with me.

Sincerely,
