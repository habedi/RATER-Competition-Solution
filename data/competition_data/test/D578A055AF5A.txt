Hello, today we shall be explaining why Venus is worthy. It's like Earth it's also slightly closer, 'cept for the fact it rains actual acid, plus the the tempature is to high. But that doesn't stop the scientist from checking it out! So let's check it out!

Venus has really powerful 'eathquake', it has weather, volcanoes. I mean it does has similar characteristic with Earth. I do understand why the scientist would try to land spaceships, even I would wanna know what Venus holds. Venus has a rocky area. That means is has familiar places like valleys, moutains, and craters.

I don't think it would be something anyone could live on but it doesn't mean in the future they won't try, everything is possible if you believ you can do it. Nothing should stop you, except for the rules, like the rules we bid by -- not the ' Golden Rules', don't get me wrong. I don't want to have anyone against me thinking I'm "crazy".

I have no religion, I have nothing against anyone. I do believe in evolution. Back to my conclusion. Scientist, NASA, will still check the planet, they might be checking it to see if life is able to grow, they also think that there could have possibly been water on the Venus once before, ages ago. I think they should continue thier search, continue their theory, and try to succeed with their dreams finally coming true.
