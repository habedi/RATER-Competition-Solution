Throughout our entire world's history, learning has become an essential factor in our progression as a society. Schools provide a free and convenient resource for kids not only to pick up on educational skills, but to also acquire important traits and attributes that will be essential to them later on in life through personal experiences. Even though some may feel as if going to school is an unnecessary way to truly educate the youth, students attending online classes at home is not beneficial due to the fact that it'll cause a disturbance to life functions that'll negatively affect this generation and the others after.

Having connections to people is one of the most vital parts of human life, as it's been shown through studies that people's mind cease to function properly without any human interaction. Attending a school environment doesn't ensure, but encourages students to interact with their fellow peers allowing for a potential relationship or bond to be formed. Not only does this allow for potential relationships, but it also provides as a way for kids to acquire essential social skills that are needed in order to progress in life. As a little kid, I was an introvert that didn't like to go out into public in fear of big crowds. Eventually I would attend elementary school, where not much changed about my shyness until I found a group of people who shared similar interests as me. Having those connections with other kids made me realize that this world was not such a scary place where the only people that truly gets you is your family. From then on I transformed into an outgoing soul not being afraid to meet new people or voice my opinions in the face of adversity. Others may say that there can be other ways to form connections with people such as: sports,clubs,and ect. What they fail to take into account though is the students who aren't interested in sports, or the students who aren't motivated enough to find clubs that they may be interested in. Continuing to require students to attend school will at least provide another way for kids to interact with each other and possibly make connections.

Another reason why attending online classes from home is a detriment to society, is because it allows students to stay in a comfortable environment and doesn't set them up for their future. In life all humans have found or will find themselves in uncomfortable situations, or facing a challenge that they may not be motivated complete; ultimately whether we decide to tackle these obstacles, or divert away from them will determine whether or not we will be successful in life. Traditionally many kids' future plans after graduating high school is attending a college and thereafter finding their dream career. In college, many students discover the hard truth that they are less concerned whether their students show up to class or learn the material unlike high school. If schools allow students to take online classes from the comfort of their house, they're doing them a disservice by not preparing them mentally for the times they may not want to get up and go to class, but have to in order to learn the material. Or in another case to find a desirable career, there will be plenty hardships and obstacles that will have to be faced in order to accomplish this goal. But kids who were always in a comfortable setting and never pushed outside their comfort zone will find themselves backing down from these obstacles as they're not mentally prepared to tackle these uncomfortable obstacles. Although it's kids have to continue to motivate themselves in different situations, school serves as an extra task to ensure that kids are able to acquire this skill of self motivation.

Physical schools not only serve as a haven for educational purpose, but also allows kids to get daily essentials needed in order to live. Many kids coming from low income families and/or living in a poor area, find that school is a safe and stable environment where they are able to escape their harsh reality. For example, in Washington D.C., three out of five kids (ages 5-18) would find themselves suffering from starvation if it wasn't for their school lunch. This devastating number would only increase if schools if schools allow kids to take online classes instead of requiring them to attend school.

Schools have played a major part in our advancement and progression as a society. Since youth they've provided experiences and developed strong traits and characteristics that'll continue on with us as we progress in our lifetime. Although as some may feel as time continues we won't need this physical building to educate, it serves as a deeper purpose to build character and mentally prepare kids for life.
