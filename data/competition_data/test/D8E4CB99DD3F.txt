I do not think it is fair for only B Grades may have fun activities. All students should be able to have at least one sport or activity. If they didn't have sports or activities they may get over weight or not be used to physical activity. I think i is very unhealthy and totally unfair to other students in the school. Yes, it may be good so students may get their grades up, but some people may not be able to. Also its very unhealthy what if the student does get a B grade after so long of not exercising and they finally get to play but they are not used to it. It may cause some serious trouble for the students heart and body.

Actually I personally think it is an awful idea no matter what the grade students should at least get exercise everyday at least 30 minutes. It is better than nothing. Plus It is good for the body. So it can get used to exercising and be healthy. They can get healthier everyday just by a little activity and/or sport(s). Also what if they never get a B grade? They may later on they may have to do a lot of physical activity and they may not be used to it! So basically earlier activities basically help them for later on in the future.

I think it unfair also because its part of the school to have physical activities for kids to enjoy and become healthier and stronger. What if most of the school had less then a B grade? You wouldn't see a lot of kids running around only a few. Its unfair also because they need exercise to be fit and not gain weight or become overweight. So at least let all grade averages have physical activity and sports they may not have earned it but it would be better for them. In the future. Trust me kids without sports and activities would be very boring and very unhealthy.

So i think the principle should undo the changes in the school. It is positively wrong and shouldn't be done under any circumstances. Kids should be able to run around and play sports they may enjoy. Having exercise is probably saving that kids life from gaining weight and having an unhealthy heart. Its the best for the kids and the school! Maybe later on it will pay off eventually. Like in other schools and higher grades with harder times. Its the best for those kids they need to run and build up some muscle so they wont be so weak and/or have an unhealthy life.
