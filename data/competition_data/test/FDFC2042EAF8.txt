Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I feel that the change is not a good one i mean keeping your students from exercising and doing activities is wrong. A lot of students in the school get a C average and i don't think that this would be fair to them to miss out on school activities. The school sports are keeping the children active and healthy so you shouldn't be letting them down. The school activities are opening students minds with new ideas ands thoughts that will help them in life.

In the sports in school like basketball, track, Pep Squad etc. People might want to be these things when they grow up. So you are making there future less and bringing them down. In there heath and confidence. What it a bow who was playing basketball wanted to do that for his high school and college and life courier and you just put a big dent in that. So i believe that you should let the people be active because it is fun and is keeping them healthy and active.

In the activities people are opening up there minds and ideas so you shouldn't stop them from that. Like in the school newspaper you are given a topic and you have to right about it. So you are using your brain and ideas to come up with those ideas. So if they have a c average in writing going to newspaper will help them bring that up. So your going to be hurting them more by not taking them to a activity.

This school SCHOOL_NAME needs some activities and sports to keep the students and there families with smiles on there faces. There students looking good and feeling good and achieving something. So is say let the students have fun and do something that will make them change. I feel that if you do this it will make SCHOOL_NAME a bad school and prohibiting students from sports and activities that will help them in life.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
