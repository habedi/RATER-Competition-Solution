Distance Learning

Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

It sounds like a good idea, but it might not be in one's best interest.

Distance learning would not be a better option because of getting the high school experience, having a work ethic, and improving social skills.

Firstly, actually attending school gives the high school experience.

High school memories last for a lifetime, and one day the stories can be told to someone's kids and future family.

Teenage years are meant to be cherished with fun and new adventures that going to school can provide.

Picture this, a family is going through old photos and one of the children finds a picture of their mom in her high school prom dress.

Memories come flooding back, and now the children get to hear about one high school experience they get to look forward to.

High school memories are meant to be cherished, and distance learning would not give the full experience.

Secondly, by attending school it encourages work ethic and competition.

There are so many extracurricular opportunities that distance learning would not offer.

Sports are a great example of this because of the competitiveness.

If one wants to be a respectable athlete, the hard work and effort needs to be put in.

It creates discipline that should be instilled as a teenager to be successful.

Also, attending school keeps the students accountable.

When a student forgets to do an assignment, the teacher can step in and make sure the work gets done.

If not completed, consequences are put in place.

Some may say it is not fair or that it is being too harsh, but in reality it teaches the importance of work ethic and accountability.

Work ethic, competition, and accountability are all practiced by attending real school.

Thirdly, actually going to school improves social skills.

How can one make it into the real world if they do not know how to properly speak in formal settings?

Sometimes it can be a good thing to get out of the normal comfort zone.

It pushes someone to reach out and do things they thought they could not achieve.

An example of this is giving presentations or taking a speech class.

For a lot of people it can be terrifying, but this practice could be helpful for a future job.

One day a little high school student could be presenting a business proposal to the vice president of the company, and they feel confident because of the practice they got in high school.

Some may say that distance learning should be allowed for mental health reasons like anxiety, but in many instances people have found it to be more harmful by staying home.

By being home it can cause isolation and loneliness, which is the last thing that should be happening in this instance.

As mentioned above getting out of one's comfort zone can be a good thing.

The more it is done, the easier it gets.

For these reasons, distance learning would not be the better choice for students.

In conclusion, distance learning would not be a better option because of getting the high school experience, having a work ethic, and improving social skills.

School is something so easy to complain about, but if a student really thinks about it, it proves to be very beneficial for moving on in life.

Attending school is a great privilege and opportunity that should be taken advantage of by every student.
