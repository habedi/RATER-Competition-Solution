Is using Facial Action Coding System valuable in students classroom? There is alot of talk about using this in classrooms and in other places like so. I don't believe it would be a good decision because one, it would take up so much time, secondly, who says it calculates what is going on in your mind or your true feelings, thirdly why use it in classrooms of all places. There are just many more places it could be used rather than a classroom. Teachers have it hard enough grading the million and one asignments than going through and analyzing their students faces.

First, the Facial Action Coding System will take so much time in one class alone, we can't take away the education from the children in order to see what are emotions are by a face scanner. Let's say you are in a 55 minute math class notes take 30 to 40 minutes a day and the teaher lets students have the beginning 10- 15 minutes of class to ask about last nights homework that all equals 40-55 minutes a day. How would you fit 30 kids into a 10 minute slot to face scan them? That is one more obstical you are going to ask teachers to jump over when they already do so much and get paid so little.

Secondly, Just because a persons face says they are feeling a certain way doesn't mean that is how they truly feel. That is like saying put this mood ring on so I can see your mood. We all know mood rings are based off of body temperature and not your actual mood. There are somethings that people are feeling that they don't want to show, I am not saying that this is a bad thing to do, but maybe not for classrooms.

Thirdly, why in classrooms of all places? Children are very clumbsy there is a better chance it won't get broken at a docotrs office or maybe at a hospital, or anywhere else besides around children. The best place for this could be at a psychiactic unit to see how the psychiatic medication has effected the paitent from day one to now. Children aren't going to be in the same mood now if you check in on them in five minutes.

In conclution, schools should not have these. I think the Facial Action Coding System could be put to use somewhere else besides in a school. Schools are so busy trying to meet regulations, making teachers do what they are to do despite not getting paid very much, and lastly it is a new and improved mood ring we have just made it fancier and given it a new name.
