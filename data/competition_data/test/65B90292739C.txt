I think that students should be allowed to use cell phones in school. First I think that they should let students use cell phones because they need it for emergency's. Second They also should let them use cell phones because they probably need something from home or something else and they can call there parents. The third reason they should let students have cell phones but not use them during class that way they will let them have cell phones in school and they will not be distracted .Next they should also turn off there cell phones during class and let them use there cell phones in lunch time or any other free times. Finally they should let students use cell phones because students still bring phones to school and use them when teachers are not around .Inconclusion These are the reasons why i think the principal should let students bring cell phones to school.
