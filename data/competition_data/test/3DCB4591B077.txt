After the long school year ended, a regular students that goes to Generic_School would think finally its summer break. Some students would have a job or would go to summer school and some students would be out on vacation to Hawaii. Unfortunately, not all students get to have a free summer break. There are schools out there that require their students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their summer break. There are debates on who should be the one who gets to design the summer projects, teachers or the students themselves. Students should be the ones who design their summer projects because as students they always have to follow instructions and rules so they should be given a little more freedom over the summer break.

There are students out there that wont feel comfortable or inspired to work on certain types of project that the teacher might have assigned them to work on over the summer so if the students get to design their own projects teachers would get to know their students way of leaning and their creativity therefore it benefit the teachers.

Students should get to design their own summer projects because they always have to follow instructions, rules and always listen to the teacher for the whole school year so shouldn't they design their own project over their break. Throughout the school year, teachers assign homework, project and give out tests and quizzes and as students, they always have to be on task and complete all the assignment to get a decent grade. So by the time summer comes students want a break, and they should get that break after all that hard work throughout the school year. Teachers shouldn't get to coose the type of projects their students get to do over the summer as long as the project is indeed school appropriate.

There are students out there that wont feel comfortable or inspired to work on certain types of project that the teacher might have assigned them to work on over the summer. There are students who are introverted and would hate to talk in front of the class, yet throughout the school year teachers assign them to present and talk in front of the class, some teachers call it "getting them out of their comfort zone" but what if that student was just uncomfortable with the topic that they have been assigned such as feet fungus for health class and having them present about it and hearing all types of whispers and giggles throughout the class, it would make anybody uncomfortable. There are projects that teachers assign that just won't work out very well for certain types of students.

If the students get to design their own summer projects, it would make it easier for teachers because they would get to know their students way of learning and how creative they can get. During the last quarter of the school year at Generic_School, art students get to have this really big and fun project, the best part is they get to pick what they want to do weather its painting on a canvas or drawing with charcoals they get to be as creative as they can be and can even mix things up!

its a great way for teachers to find what their students favorite topic was and what their students ahve learned because it would reflect in their students masterpieces everyone gets to see what thier classmates have done, and the best part is hearing everyone explain their project, where they got inspired and how they got inspired, it showed how everyone has a different thoughts process and ideas.

Everyone have different ideas and ways of doing things same, with learning there are students that would learn better a certain way when there are students that would learn better the complete opposite. It should be the students choice on what they want to do over their summer. If the teacher assigns a project for the students to work on over the summer, the summer is most likely ruined for most, so students should be the ones who design their summer projects because, as students they always have to follow instructions and rules so they should be given a little more freedom over the summer break. There are students out there that wont feel comfortable or inspired to work on certain types of project that the teacher might have assigned them to work on over the summer so if the students get to design their own projects teachers would get to know their students way of leaning and their creativity therefore it benefit the teachers therefore, If the teacher did design the students summer project, students wouldn't be as motivated.
