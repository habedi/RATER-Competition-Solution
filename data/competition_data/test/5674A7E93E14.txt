dear principal policy 1-

You should let students bring there phones to school and allow them to only use them during lunch and during free time. And the phones have to be turned off during classes. If the phones are not turned off during the classes you could take the phones away and there parents will have to come after school.

policy2-

Principal you should not let students to have phone in school at all. Because maybe the students may have the phones during class and be texting whit there friends. So then they will not do any work during the class.

So is better to let the students to have there phone only during lunch and free time. Because maybe if there a emergency and they have to tell something to there parents they could ask them. Or if the students forgot there home work they could call there parents and so the parents will bring the homework. So i thing is better for you to pick policy 1.
