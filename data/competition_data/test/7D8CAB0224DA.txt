Summer is the time student get a break from school and the stress that comes with it. It is a time they get to have fun with the friends and family. Where they get to explore the world and having them do a project during this time is awful. But if it is required, the best suggestion would be to let the student decide what their project would be about. If they have to take time from their vacation to work on something, it should be something they have control over and something they have an insterest in. Not only will they have fun doing the project, they will learn something new.

There are many reasons as to why allowing students pick their project would be the best. For example, students are more likely to put time and effort into what they are learning if they are exicted for. They will learn better and understand what they are doing if they are exicted about what they are learning. If the student have control over what they have to do, it will most likely involve what they are planing to do that summer. Also no one wants feel like they are working during vacation, it takes the fun out of the break. Students who enjoy what they are learning are more likely to pay attention in class and that goes for the summer project. If they willing to use the limited time they have to enjoy the summer, it would definitly be something they want to learn about or something they have an insterest in.

This could also open other doors for the students. The more they have control over the topic, the more they learn something new not just about the topic but even about themselves. The more time they spend figuing out what they will be working on this summer, the more knowledge they gain. For instance, in order for them to find the perfect project they would need to try different topics to see what fits them. This gives the a chance to expore and to see what other topics that may interest them; that option is taking away when the teachers are the one making the choice for the students. The main idea or reason for giving the students a summer project is to make sure that, they students are learning over the summer. But it is not really possible when the students do not have right to choose the project, not only are they not really going to their best, some just won't do it.

There will be a bigger range of topics when the students have the choice. This does not only impact the students but the teachers that have to grade the student's project. Not only will they not have to waste time having to grade project that are done will little to no effort. The teachers can get exicted to grade students who put effort and time into what they did because they not only had fun but actually enjoyed what they had to do. There are many issues that can come with this desicion, regardless of its benefits. One main problem would be the students will not take it serouisly as they should because they will have control over how the project is done. Instead of having a rubric made by the teacher as to how it is done, they will have the freedom do as they please. Which could have a postive or negative impact, giving students this amount of freedom can be used in the wrong way.

However, giving the students the ability to make their own choices goes beyond school, this is something that will impact their life. Allowing the students to think of themselves will benefit them when they are in this big world on their own. Which is why students are forced to go to school in the first place, to prepare them for life. Students in general do not get the chance to decide how their days are spent. The way they spend their day is decided by someone else wheather their parents or by the school. They are told when to wake up every morning, where they are suppose to be at every hour, what they have to learn, even when and what they have to eat. So giving the student a chance to decide for themsleves on what they have to do during the summer, goes beyond learning something new during summer break but how to be their own person.
