Does technology really help a student learn or does it distracted them more? In these day technology has a huge part of our society and most of us could not live without it, so most of our schools are starting to use technology by teaching students using online classes or videos conferees, however that's not the right way to teach a student, because no all students have the same ability to learn some of them need extra help or support from teacher, for example, some students get distracted really fast, need extra help when it comes to learn different topics, students may also be better learners in big groups.

First, students get distracted really fast, for example they would not be able to consecrate while having the freedom to do what ever they want in their house, most of them would not be mature enough to spend their time wisely; for example they would be wasting it in video game, social media, TV shoes, movies, etc. other would just not do their work because there would not be someone helping them to do it.

Second, some student need extra help when it comes to learn different topics, for example some student need one on one help from someone to understand the topic that they are learning better or maybe some of the topics may be really hard and the videos or the classes online would not be enough to learn the topic.

finally, students may also be better learners in big group, for example when doing group project students get to know the topic from a different point of view from their class mates and that can really help them, because they can teach the student something that the teacher couldn't, in the other hand at home student would not be able to get feed back from class mate, because they would not have any.

In conclusion, students doesn't benefit from taking courses online because most of them have trouble learning that way and needs differences types of ways to learn where they interact more with others, therefor schools should start worrying more about making students come to classes, by making them more fun and easier to learn, and not waste their time trying to make student take online courses, also making students take classes from their house will not help them in their future, because it would be hard for some students to go out into the real world and find a job, get medical help, getting to meet new people,etc just because the school system taught them to do everything online from their house.
