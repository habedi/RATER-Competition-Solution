Dear: Principal

I am writing this letter to inform you that we the students of SCHOOL_NAME are against the school policy about having a B average to be able to participate in sports or in other school activities. I think we should at least have a C average to participate. A C average is good to be eligible for sports. I think that when a student participates in a school activity and has a grade below a C, he should have time bring his grade up in school. If that student has a D in one subject and the rest C and above he should work hard to raise his D up so he can be on a sport team. These are reasons why i think the activity participation should be a C average.

I hope you like my letter and be sure enough to change the school policy in participation activities to be a C grade average.

Thank you for your time

Sincerely:STUDENT_NAME
