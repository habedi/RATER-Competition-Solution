Can there be life on Mars? The answer is NO! How can there be life on mars without food, water, plants, and oxygen. For a human to live on Mars they would have to bring a life supply on food and water, but you can't have a life supply of oxygen. So there can not be life on mars.

The Face on Mars is not a really face. There can not be life on Mars. First, aliens are not real. Second, there is no oxgyen. The article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," states "huge rock formation.... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."

The Face on Mars only happen one time. Another aircraft went back at the same degress and a cloudy day just like the one before. When it took the picture there was just a landform. This aircraft even had a better camera and took even more pictures.

The article says " What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." Gavin says " It reminds me most of Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an islated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

That is why the Face on Mars is just a landform not a alien or an alien made it. It was just a illusion not anthing else.
