Studying Venus is worth it, even though there are many dangers. Venus is Earth's sister planet and often reffered to as our "twin." Venus is the closest to Earth in size and density. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun, which makes it very hot and hard for there to be life on Venus. Studying Venus could give us an idea of how closely related the Earth and Venus really are, despite the dangers.

Venus has many dangers, but it is worthy of studying. In the text it states that Venus could of had large oceans and could have supported many different forms of life. Venus now doesn't have any forms of life on it, given it is the 2nd closest planet to the sun and it woul dget really hot. Back then there could have been large rivers and oceans to support the different forms of life. Also in the text it states that NASA is planning to send people on a trip to study Venus. In this trip, they could find out really how closely related Eatrh and Veuns are.

In conclusion, studying Venus could give us an idea of how closely related the Earth and Venus really are, despite the dangers. Although it would be different climate and air pressure, in the near future people will go to Venus to explore what there is to find there. 97 percent of Venus' aptmosphere is carbon dioxide, which makes it even more dangerous for there to be life on Venus. After all the "twin" plnets might be nothing alike. Studying and exploring Venus is worth it, despite the dangers.
