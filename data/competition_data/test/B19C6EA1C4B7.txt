Dear Principal,

I believe you should use policy one because, many students do not have things to do during free time. Most students are pretty good at following the rules with phones. Some students have their phones on them all day because they do not trust the lockers are a safe place for their expensive materials, but they are off. It is not fair to have to keep something so valuable in your locker. Things are being stolen. You say the only thing to keep that from happening is to not tell other people your locker combination or to keep your lock on your locker. You only give us students three minutes to get from one class on the upper floor down to our lockers, unlock them, grab our stuff then go back upstairs to our next class. Or, you give us the three minutes to get from a downstairs class to our upstairs lockers just to walk to the other side of the building! It really does seem unreasonable. That is why most people keep the lock off their lockers. They have more time to use to get to their classes. With an unlocked locker I do not think I would leave my cell phone in there.

Cell phones are a hard policy to debate on because you can not just say everyone has one and everyone keeps it on all day. Many people use their phones. It is very unfair that they do not get caught, but that is just something you have to live with. One day cell phones will not be a problem for adults. Just about everyone will have one. If cell phones were such a problem people would not have them. Yes, it is another bill to pay but not everyone has to pay for their phones. Some students are home-schooled and just get our early. Us children in the schools can not help that.

I do not think you should take phones away because some people need their phones to get a hold of parents. It is not easy to get a ride home when you do not have your phone. Maybe teachers should just watch more carefully for phones. It is a school rule not to have your phone on you so if they suspect that you have it then they should be able to ask for it. Many times students take their phones out in class and use them a teacher would never know if they are not in the class. Not very many people are going to tell that you have your phone on you, and not many are going to say you are using it. Many children carry gum around with them. They make phones that small now. I do not think that some of the teachers understand that. It is quite easy to hind a phone. Many people use sweat shirts, others use their shoes. Some, even just make it look like gum! So if you think about it, many students do break the phone rule. They do not like to they just like using their phones all the time. Some people just have to talk to other people all the time. So, it is just like if you do not see them then your just simply text them when they are not busy.

Many of us do not care when we are busy. I still think you should be favor students keeping their phones. If they are out in free times we are not really hurting anything. But, if you take them and say we can not have them at school then many people will not be able to contact parents. I believe all of the students would plead the same story. So please let us keep our phones.

Sincerely,

Me
