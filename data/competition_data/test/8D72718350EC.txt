Have you ever seen a alien before? If you have not seen them before how would you know if aliens are real or not. I will know because im in the NASA and aliens are not real.

Aliens are not real because if they were they wouldn't be living on Mars because there's no life on Mars they most likey would invade Earth as we know it. Whatever you seen on Mars it was just a natural landform. If aliens were real they would have almost the same things we have like two eyes, mouth, and two feet, and two ears. The difference between us would be either brown, or gray.

I think aliens aren't real because the face which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Also thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.
