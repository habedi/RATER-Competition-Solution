Some people say the the face on mars was created by aleins. But there is no clear evidence that suports that aleins are real therefore that idea cant be right.

18 years after the vivking expedition ened a team went back to the red planet to snap a picture ten times better than the origanl one. It was posted to JPL web site and said it was a natural land form not an alien artifact.

A lot of people were not happy with this conclusion. They argrued that the face was 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter at the time of the picture.

When the picture was taken it was a cloudy day on the planet and the camera had to see through several cloud layers to see the face. Some say this blocked out any chance to see alein markings.

After doing the test and reasche they have concluded that there is no real sign of aleins and it was just a massive landform.
