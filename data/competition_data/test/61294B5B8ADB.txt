Dear Principal,

I believe that Policy 1 is a better option.

You should allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time.

I believe this is a better option than not allowing cell phones at school at all for a few reasons.

First, cell phones are good to have in an emergency.

If something bad happened at school, it would be nice to text your parents to tell them what happened and they would feel much better to know you are safe.

Also, what if a student misses the bus, if cell phones are not allowed at school at all, than how would you be able to tell your mom to come pick you up?

Another reason why cell phones would be good to have at school would be if an after school activity was cancelled and you need to tell your parents that you will need a ride home, it would be so easy to call them from your cell phone in between classes.

There is nothing wrong with using cell phones at lunch, as long as you keep them turned off during classes.

Teachers could set rules against having them on in classes, such as taking your phone away when you are caught with it on during class.

That would help kids to follow the rules.

One more reason why cell phones are a good idea at school is that it would be nice to text your friend across the school during free time or in between classes.

For example, someone has a friend in seventh-grade across the school.

She forgot her math homework in the cafeteria.

Her friend is right by the cafeteria and is on her way over to the seventh-grade hallway.

It would be very helpful if she could text her friend to tell her to pick it up for her and save her the trip.

There are lots of benefits to being allowed to have cell phones at school.

It would make life so much easier and make many people happy.

That is why I believe Policy 1 is a better option than Policy 2.

Sincerely,
