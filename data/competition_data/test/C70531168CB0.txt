Many people around the world drive vehicles to get from point a to point b. Although this is a good source of personal transportation, it may not be as favorable as people imagine.

Primarily, the decrease in vehicles being a source of personal transportation is fairly beneficial to the environment and ourselves. In fact, this new "phenomenon" is happening all over the world. As mentioned in the articles "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", "Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog", "Car Free Day is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota", and "The End of Car Culture", many citizens of many different cultures see that the lowered usage of vehicle transportation doesn't only decrease how many greenhouse gasses are getting in the atmosphere but also improves our wellbeing by reducing stress levels. Not only does it help us relieve stress and what ails us but it also makes the distance we have to travel to purchase food much shorter, as cited in "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", giving us the opportunity to restock our supply over time instead of buying multiple cart loads at once.

Secondarily, according to the article "The End of Car Culture", having access to busses and other public transportation can improve our safety. It is also seen in this article that "at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford came up with a business plan to create a world where personal vehicle ownership isn't needed or is undesirable. His company would partner up with the telecommunications industry to help create new cities and towns in which many ways such as using a bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation, and simply walking could be woven into a connected network." With this new plan, there would be improved safety by having official drivers providing the bus transportation and private car transportations. Both of these ways are liable to give us extra time in our days by decreasing the probability of traffic and will give us ultimate safety while getting from point a to point b.

There are many cultures in our world today who go along with the plan of decreasing the amount of vehicle transportation. There are many different ways this is being achieved and every one of us can be a part of it.
