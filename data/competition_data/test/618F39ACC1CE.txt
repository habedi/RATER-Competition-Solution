Dear principle,

In my opinion I am for the principles new policy for students to have at least a grade B average to participate in school activities. This school policy will then encourage more kids with averages less than B to do better. Students will then study more, get good grades, and not fool around during class time. If the students in the school look good then the school itself will look good.

When students hear about this new rule that will then change the way the act in school. If They want to participate in school activities they will change. Then instead of fooling around during class they will, then pay attention in class, ask questions, and take notes. If they take notes then when it comes to taking test's and quizzes they will pass the test or quiz.

The students will study more. Kids obviously don't study for tests. They know even if they get an F on the test they will still be able to participate in school activities. Now if the new policy takes place, and they get an F on the test they wont be able to participate in any sports or school activities. So students will then know to study more.

If students who get B' s and A' s on tests they are the ones who are good in class and don't need help. Those who get lower then B' s really need help. So while the students who have good averages are playing and having fun the other students will be learning. The teacher will understand why they have been getting low grades, and teach them at their level. Eventually they will understand and will be getting high marks.

I am for the principles new policy of having at least a B average to participate in sports or school activities. This new rule will encourage students to be more productive in class, and to study more. However if the new policy did not happen then everything will be the same. Students will be continuing to fail, not paying attention in class, and just not being productive enough. If the students in the school do not look good then the school will not look good, but if the students do look good then the school will look good. More and more students will come to this school, and they will be getting good grades.
