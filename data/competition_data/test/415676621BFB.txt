Dear Principal,

I'm sure you're painfully aware of the fact that the use of cell phones in our school has grown an immeasurable amount, and that is not okay. School is a place for learning and growing and socializing with your peers face to face, not over cell phones, and I am here to give you a few reasons as to why we should keep students from using their phones during school hours.

This is a very debatable topic and there are many pros and cons when it comes to this situation but one that I think I should address is the argument that kids should be able to use their phones during lunch and free periods because it doesn't affect their learning. This statement is false for a few reasons. For one, often times free periods are used as study halls for kids with busy schedules, so if we allow phones during these free periods kids will never get their work done and they'll go home with a ton of homework simply because they wasted their study hall on their phones.

Also, if we allow kids to use their phones during lunch and free periods it is very likely that they will sneak their phones into their other classes and use them, which not only distracts them but the students around them. It has been proven that the human brain is not very good at multi-tasking. So, if these kids are spending their school day texting they will have missed out on a entire days worth of education. And who knows, maybe what they learned that day will be on the big test coming up in a few days, and they'll have missed all that important information that they need to pass.

These kids could get caught, get their phones taken away, and have to serve a detention after school. Which will lead to upset kids which could lead to possible fights, rebellions, and other negative things, which should be avoided at all cost. A school without phones is a school with smart happy students.

Also, school funds rely on the test scores of their students. Good scores=happy school board, bad scores=upset school board. And I think everyone can agree that a happy school board, makes a happy school, makes a happy teacher, makes a happy student.

And if kids are on their phones rather than paying attention in class they won't learn, so their scores will drop, the happy school board will disappear, and so will the funds for those new books the school was hoping to purchase.

And then all this drama within the school would easily upset parents, and you do not want to have to deal with that craziness.

So help me, help the teachers, help the students, help the school board, and help you by keeping kids focus on their studies not their text buddies.
