In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft snapped a picture of what appeared to be a human face, in a region, Cydonia, on Mars. Scientists figures that it was just a "Martian mesa". The figure was just a natural landform. Photo evidence points us in that direction.

In 1998, Michael Malin's MOC captured a picture ten times sharper than the first. The photo showed us a natural landform. Some weren't so easily swayed.

Once again, in 2001, another picture was taken from Malin's team. It was taken at the camera's maximum resolution. The picture showed the equivalent to a buttle or mesa. Garvin said that it reminded him "the most of the Middle Bittle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."

However, conspiracy theorists Think that the face is evidence of life on Mars. That NASA would want to hide exactly that. At the same time defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient civilization there.

All the photos taken to see what the face on Mars really was shows us one thing. The "face" on Mars was just a natural landform. Just another Martian mesa.
