In this passage there is a debate on a 'human faced rock formation"

whether it's a natural landform or a alien artifact. Many believed alien markings were hidden by haze. While others believed it was a natural landform based on evidence. Scientists have alot of evidence that the human face rock is just a landform. "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size" meaning if there was any type of alien life form on Mars then the digital images would show some type of evidence of it.

Instead, scientists just keep finding evidence and taking pictures that points everything about the human faced rock back to a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is loacted 41 degrees North martian latitiude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. In regards to that the picture actually shows the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa. Trying to convince someone to believe what scientists say i wold bring out alot of information about the human faced rock showing it's just a landform by telling that person scientists figured it was just a martain mesa, common around

Cydonia. Many say the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.

With many saying NASA would rather hide conspiracy theories, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization. Althougth few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact photographing cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived on the Red planet. While eveyone was waiting for a picture of the face and it was revealed it showe no alien monument after all. Mission controllers prepared to look again "it's not easy to target cydonia" saif Garvin. In conclusion all evidence scientists are collecting about this human faced rock all comes out to be just a natural landform.
