My life has been so interesting ever since I bacame a seagoing cowboy. There is just so much to do and it's so exsiting. Some people might say "it's so much time to get places what will we do in the mintime?" well my buddies the other seagoing cowboys make it all worth wild. You should become a sea going cowboy with me becase. After we leave the animals to where they belong the trip back is verry interesting. We play baseball and vollyball games where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, Whittling, and games helpes pass the time. This is much more than an adventure this opened up the world to me.

Being a seagoing cowboy is much more than the fun. Helping these animals makes me feel that I did something good for others, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. This makes me feel so a complished with myself. I know I did a good deed and that makes me happy.

You also get to visit so many places. I got to visit Europe that is were my seagoing cowboy expirience started. I also went to Greece, China Venice, Italy,a city with streets of water. It took me two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean. I remeber on trip I was watch man for the night it was pretty cool if you ask me.

I would love to see others joining the seagoing cowboys it would make me so happy. Please join the feeling of helping others is just great hopefully you will too so join now! I am glade I took this oppertunity I wouldn't change this for anything.
