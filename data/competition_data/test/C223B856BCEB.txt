Dear Principal ,

I am against Community Service and tutoring elementary kids . Here are my reasons why . Community Service does take away time from us students need . For example some students may or may not go home right away . They probably have sport to go to , be with friends , tutoring , or detention . We don't have time for Community Service . All of us work too hard to be needing to do Community Service . By the time we arrive home it'll be around 6 sometimes maybe even 7 . We'll still need to eat , do homework , shower , chores , and then watch a little bit of television . At the end of day were tired and stressed out from school . Why do we need Community Service added to our list of stress ? It's a waste of time and energy . I agree the environment needs to get clean . That ain't our job though ! Get somebody else . Tutoring elementary students is helpful and may feel good after you've tutored . I personally wouldn't want to tutor some students may feel that way too . What if were the reason they may have failed a test ?

I would want a more experienced person to be teaching my kids not some Junior High or High school student . We don't know as much as we think . That's why teachers should do their job and what their getting paid for and teach the students right so us students don't be needing to tutor other students . This letter may sound harsh , but it's the truth and needs to be heard .

Sincerely Concerned Student,
