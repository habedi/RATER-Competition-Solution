The Face on Mar's is just a natural landform because, there is no living organism on Mar's . scientist figurged it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shawdo9ws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Some scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. So as you read you might think there is something living on Mar's but the Face on Mar's is acually is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms it is common around the American West. A lava dome is the form of the Face on Mar's, " the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mar's. To Conclusion, A lava dome is the creation of the Face because Mar's is not a place where you are abl;e to live because if you are not able to plant how would you have food to live and temp. get as high as 100 degrees in the morning and as low as 0 degrees at night also there are very bay storms so i do not know if anyone would be able to live on Mar's.
