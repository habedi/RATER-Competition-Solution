According to the story you should join this group because you get to travel the world and see things you never seen before like in the story it says" I had a side benefit of seeing Europe and China". You aslo get to see the needs that other countries dont have like Luke said in the story "It made me aware of people of other countries and their needs".

There will also be something for you to do all the time because you will have to feed and water the animals two to three times a day according to the story. You still can have fun to as it is mentioned in the story they still played baseball table-tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling as it helps pass time too.

What Luke is trying to say is that if you get this job the world will open up to you, you will see more things you will also see the needs that people dont have like I mentioned in the beginning. You will get to travel you might even host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years like Luke did. All he trying to say is this job will help you all lot and you are helping other people to.
