Most people think extracurricular activities are a waste of time, but are they really a waste of time? I think extracurricular activities are a good thing for students because it helps with mental health like bringing kids out of their comfort zone. Another reason why I think extracurricular activities are a good thing is because it can help with students social skills, for example, they can interact with peers. Lastly another reason why extracurricular activities are beneficial is because studentsÃÂ´ can learn new things, for example, they can learn how to debate on topics. These are some reasons why I think extracurricular activities are beneficial because it helps with mental health, social skills, and for students learn new things.

One reason why extracurricular activities are good for students is because it helps with their mental health. An example would be it would help students come out of their comfort zone and make new friends. Another very good reason why extracurricular activities can help with mental health would be for students to be able to talk to someone outside of school hours to someone they trust and confide in. Lastly another very good example why extracurricular activities can be very good for students mental health would be for students to be able to interact more with other studentÃÂ´s because during school hours students do not have much time to interact with other studentsÃÂ´ except for in lunch and that is a very short amount of time. That is one way extracurricular activities can benefit students mentally.

Secondly another reason why extracurricular activities are beneficial for students because it can help them with social skills. A reason why extracurricular activities can benefit students would be social skills. One example would be for students to make new friends. A second example would be it can help students interact better with peers and teachers. One last reason would be for students to learn good social skills for the future when they want to apply for college or apply for a job. That is a second example on why extracurricular activities can benefit students socially.

Lastly another reason why extracurricular activities are positive for students would be for students to learn new things if they join certain extracurricular activities. A good example would be for students to experience different types of views on certain topics and how to see different sides of the problem, how to work with those view points, and to respect someones opinion. The students would also learn how to debate on topics concerning the school, community, or world events and work on ways to figure out how to fix those issues. One last reason would be for students to learn how to represent their school and to influence other students from different schools to join clubs and make new friends. That is a third and final example on why extracurricular activities can benefit students on how to learn new things.

Extracurricular activities are very important for students. They help students with their mental health and ways to make new acquaintances or friends. Extracurricular activities also helps with students social skills because students donÃÂ´t get much social time in school. And one last reason why itÃÂ´s very important for students to participate in extracurricular activities would be to learn new experiences. I think schools should be pushing students to do at least one extracurricular activity. That is why I agree that extracurricular activities are a good thing because itÃÂ´s good for students mental health, social skills, and for his or her to make new experiences.
