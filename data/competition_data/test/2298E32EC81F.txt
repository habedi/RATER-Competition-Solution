"Oh my god!" Generic_Name yelled. "I have soccer practice and I cant go because of this stupid extracurricular activity!" In the next practice, the coach yelled at him saying that he should be at every practice. Generic_Name promised he wouldn't miss another practice, so he asked his principal if he could do the activity after his soccer practice. The principal accepted the offer and Generic_Name was relieved. So the next day, he joyfully went to practice and then went to go do his activity. When he got home, he was exhausted. He ate dinner and immediately went to bed because of how late it was. The next morning, when he went to school, he had a test and failed it because he had no energy to think. He even failed the homework because he had no time to work on it. Many students are experiencing the same problem as Generic_Name. Students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity because they have other things to do, it would take time out of their free time, and it would waste students' energy.

Firstly, students have to do other things during the day. For example, when I was in fourth grade, I was forced to do chess club and I forgot to do laundry after school. On the next day, I had no clean clothes to wear so I was forced to go to school with dirty clothes. Later on that year, my friend had basketball practice and he couldnt go because he had to do drama instead. He and his mom got a call from his coach saying that he shouldn't miss practice ever again.

Secondly, an extracurricular activity would take time out of a student's free time. To begin with, one day I had to do do an activity after school and when I got home, I ate dinner and I boringly went to sleep. A furthermore example is that my friend had to do archery after school and got home at eight o'clock. He then complained about not having enough time to play video gamesÂ and was sent to his room to go to sleep.

Finally, an extracurricular activity would waste students' energy. For example, one day I got home later than usual and went to bed late. On the next day, I barely had any energy to get up from bed, and I wasn't able to concentrate on a quiz, so I got a C. Additionally, my friend did football every day after school and he went home exhausted. In result of that, he slept in most of his classes and got yelled at most of the day.

"Soccer practice was fun, right Generic_Name" his teammate asked. "Yeah it was," he replied. In the next practice, the coach congratulated him because of how well he was playing. The next day he went to practice again and played perfectly well. He got home early and did his homework. He also had a good amount of time, so he played video games until dinner and went to sleep. The next morning, Generic_Name got a good grade on his test and also got a good grade on the homework. Because of this change, Generic_Name was able to improve academically and mentally. Many students could experience this too if they aren't forced to do extracurricular activities. Students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity because they have other things to do, it would take time out of their free time, and it would waste students' energy.
