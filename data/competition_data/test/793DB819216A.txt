In the prompt, the author supports his idea poorly. The author is trying to prove his point that Venus is worth our time and resources to explore for some further insight to a planet close to us. While this topic is interesting, it is unlikely. The author immediately tells you how harsh the planet is, not introducing it in a way that would make you think it is possible to explore. Then, after explaining the conditions, the author describes a few ways that we could try to research it, and these few ways are inefficient.

By telling us how the planet's surface is harsh and unforgiving immediately, the author presents the idea that it would be too hard to explore. The author even describes how not a single mission had lasted more than a few hours on the planet. After this description, they then try to prove to the audience that it is reasonable to research the planet further. Their argument is that since the planet is closest to us, it should be explored. While the planet does happen to be close and similar to earth, that gives us no reason to explore it. As said in the author's previous paragraph, the planet's conditions are inhabitable. The planet may at one point have been relatively similar to earth, but over time it has become completely different. This gives us a large reason to not want to further research this planet. The other argument that the author makes is how there are certain ways we could research the planet. One of said techniques of research is to have a "blimp-like vehicle" hover around 30 miles above the planet. While this idea sounds interesting in thought, there are many problems with it. In this paragraph, they describe why they think their idea would work. They think that we could develop this vehicle to resist the 170 degree temperature and air pressure similar to that of the ocean, not to mention radiation. With our current technology, it is plausable that this vehicle could be created. Plausable, however, does not mean we can. We would not only have to develop a type of airship that could resist temperatures of 170 degrees and keep it's crew from overheating, but we would also have to make it resistant to high pressure comparable to the ocean, something we see with submarines. The reason why this alone is a huge problem is because we only see submarines underwater, not 30 miles above the surface of a planet. To be able to make something that can resist high pressure, high temperature, and be able to have enough fuel to stabalize itself, is beyond our current technology.

The author has reason to want to explore Venus. As a race, we naturally want to explore, but some things we just can not. If conditions were to better over years, this idea may be considered once again, but as of now, it does not seem to be possible.
