Summer is in the air! The warm humid sun is burning the area, just like the summer projects that are assign to the students; however, like unexpected summer problems, you don't know what project you're assigned with. Some students may have easy projects, other students could have difficult projects. Student's could have the whole summer vacation turning into a project vacation; unless, students can design their own projects. If students are able to design their own project, rather then teachers designing the student's projects, then this project could be a piece of cake.

One of the reasons why students should be able to design their projects, is that they would be able to design their own topics. While researching a topic they have chosen, students might have a little bit of fun while researching/working on their project. Let's take the MYP as an example. The MYP, a project fair for sophomore students, let's the sophomore students design their own topic. Most of the sophomore students chose something they enjoyed doing, other sophomores students chose something they've never done; yet, have a ton of fun trying to design that topic. If you chose a topic that you aready know about, then you can get this project under a bag. To add in, students might also find something they haven't known before.

Another reason why students should design their project, is that they wouldn't have any stress related problems while working on their project. Students would be able to decide which level of difficultly they want to do while working on their projects. Let's say someone has a disability, like Autism or ADHD, that won't allow them to do what citizens normally do in this world. Students with these disabilities can decide what difficultly they want their project to be, so they wouldn't have to stress during the project. (Trust me, as a student with Autism, the level of difficultly is very important for a project.)

I think one of the reason's why teachers design the project, is because teachers might want to persuade their students to take a challenge. They might assign students about something important; however, students wouldn't understand that topic and may get confused. Teachers will assign assignments that would require research: furthermore, the student's are in a challenging situation. That's what teachers wants their student's to do.

Students might not know there'll be a situation that is very difficult to get though. If the teachers assign them a difficult challenge, the situation the student's in might become a piece of cake

Summer vacation always goes by like a child growing up too fast, so why won't a project do the same thing? You may never know what kind of project to expect when a teacher starts assigning assignments to students they don't know; however, if you're able to design your own project, then the project will be a spec that will wash away in an instance.
