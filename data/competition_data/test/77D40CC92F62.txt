Some people will argue weather summer projects should be student or teacher designed. Schools will sometimes assign projects in order for students to learn during the break. Some will argue that these projects should be made by students so they are learning what they want to over the summer. Others will argue that teachers should come up with the projects so students are learning something that is in the curriculum. Summer projects should be student designed because students get to express creativity, student designed projects show a better understanding of what was learned,and students will be more interested and willing to learn.

Student designed projects allow the student to display creativity. When projects are assigned students have to follow a set of procedures , guidelines and topics for the project leading to very similar projects, but if students could designed the projects topic it will lead to a large variety of unique projects. Students will get to show how they think by designing projects which show off a students creativity. For example in my class's biology project each group had to follow a set of guidelines but got to choose the topics leading to a more varied and creative list of projects each showing the group of students creative and indviutal aspects. As well as showing creativity student designed projects also show a better understanding of what is learned.

Student designed projects show how students understood what they learned more than teacher designed do. In a teacher based projects the application of what the learning means is already made meaning students might not know how the knowledge apply in real life. However, in a student designed projects students will have to know what the learning meant by designing a project that apply's the knowledge in a practical way. For example in my earth science class we learned about erosion and had a project on it where we had to make a scenario on how erosion would change an area. Instead of the teacher just giving us a scenario and asking how does erosion effect it over time we had to come up with our own scenario showing that we acutely understand where ,when and how erosion happens and what its effects are. Through showing creativity and a better understanding of learned information student based projects can also make a student more interested in learning.

Student designed projects will make a student more interested in learning especially over the summer. During summer break most students don't want to do school related things,so having a teacher assigned a projects just makes the student irritated and turns them away from learning. With student designed projects the students get to pick topics there interested in and actually want to learn about leading to an increased effort in the project and an increased interest on learning. For example in my Spanish class we had to make a movie over the break, however each group got to pick any movie genre they wanted and any style of filming. If my teacher just gave us an assigned genre the project would of make me annoyed and want to quit Spanish, but sense we got to designed or own movie from scratch the project was a lot more fun and made me interested in learning more in the class. Thats how student designed projects increases a student's interest in learning more than teacher designed projects do.

Those are the reason schools should make summer projects student designed. While some will argue that if students got to design summer projects they could just make really lazy or simple projects. However these people do not take in to consideration that if a student is doing something they like or are interested in students will put more effort into it then they would with a teacher designed project. In the end summer projects should be student designed because students get to show their unique aspects to learning, students can show that they know how to apply class room knowledge to real life, and students will be more interested to learn over summer break.
