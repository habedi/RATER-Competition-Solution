Extracurricular activities get you involved with the people and around you and your entire community no matter which one you choose.

Sports are a good extracurricular activity to try.

Another good option is joining the theater.

Lastly, another good option would be joining any musical program offered by your school.

All of these options I have presented offer many benefits.

Sports are a good extracurricular activity to try.

There is such a large variety of sports for you to try that you will always find something that you enjoy.

If you play any sport then you get the chance to meet a lot of new people.

When playing sports you travel a lot and would get to experience lots of new things.

Playing sports opens up so many more opportunities for anyone, no matter the sport.

Another option would be getting involved with a theater.

While part of a theater you get to experience either being the star of the show or working quietly backstage.

Some theaters travel to perform their shows, sometimes to famous places.

You could make new friends with either your fellow actors or actresses or the stage crew.

Theater is another great way to get involved with extracurricular activities and generally have a great time.

Lastly, getting involved with music programs is another great way to get involved with extracurricular activities.

Music is a fun way to be as creative as you want and perform in front of people.

Whether you are a soloist or part of a group you would get to make plenty of new friends.

Music programs generally travel quite frequently which lets everyone try new things and meet people they otherwise would never meet.

Music programs are another great way to get involved with extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, these are all of my reasons to join the extracurricular activities that I told you about.

There are plenty more activities than the ones that I have previously stated but they all will benefit you in some way.

I agree with this principle and think that others should follow them.

Extracurricular activities benefit all types of people and I think you should give some a try.
