Dear principle,

I feel that making student perform community service is a great idea for it can be very helpful in many ways.

Everybody needs a helping hand especially in this day and age, And with kids performing community service tasks things will get done easier and more efficiently. There are lots of options for community services that are greatly needed, such as daycare help or picking up litter on our streets. There's no harm in having kids help out and it can only do good.

Have you ever heard the term with great power comes great responsibility? If you have, then you should already know that its very important to teach adolescents/teens about the importance of responsibility. With community service it can teach them how to use responsibility by helping people in there community. And that can also help them gain knolage to perform those certain tasks and mabie they will use the knolage in there profession one day.

community service is also enviromentaly frien
