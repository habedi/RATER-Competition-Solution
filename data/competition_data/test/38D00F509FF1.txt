Schools do their best to provide best education for all the students. They have various types of summer projects, classes, programs, education tours, online courses and more, that a student can participate on. Some schools even have internships that students get paid from. Some schools assign students their projects to assure, that they continue learning during their break. Most students fail to continue to learn because they have their own personal plans to accomplish during their summer break. But, some students fail to do it because the projects were given from their previous teacher, that they have already had and they do not want to work for them again. They would be more happier to design their own project for the break. The fact that they want to choose their own project is because they want to be more productive and more innovative. Although, summer projects should be student-designed.

Some people might claim that, projects should be school-based and it should be assigned by the teachers because they have the best opinions for the student to work on and they are more relevant. Teachers can evaluate students' weaknesses and give them projects based on what they need, for their own practice and revision session during the break. Teachers should assign project about the course, that they have already completed for more revision and for more details about it. For example, i already completed the earth science course on my freshmen year but, for more details and information about the topic that we discussed, our teacher gave us the project about the climate change and the impact on the environment, during the summer time, so that we can be productive and visualize in our break. Teacher-designed projects are more reliable because the teacher can choose a specific topic for the students' requirement. Some students are naive, they can't come up with a topic and they end up not doing it. Of course, many students will probably disagree on student-designed projects, and claim that teacher-designed topics are way better. However, every person has an interest on doing something or every person have a hobby. Moreover, students should be able to decide on what they desire to work on from their own interest or describe about their hobby, writing an essay.

Students should be self-reliance of themselves because self-reliance is the key to success. They should not depend on anyone else, but their heart and the way how they think, that will bring accomplishments to their lives. I understand that teachers are responsible of giving the best topics for students to work on, but i believe that, students have followed all the directions of the teacher, during the entire school-year, but in a long break, it should be the opposite. Teachers should allow students to think of their own and come up with a topic ,and write what they have learned from the teachers. Student-designed projects will help them research about topics and, it will benefit them for the future. It will help them think independently. It will allow them to choose their desired topic and work on their own will. For example, my oceanography teacher allowed us to pick a topic from the board and he gave us an option to choose our own topic too. I managed to pick a topic that i desired, eventually, i completed my project researching and thinking about the topic on my own because i was able to elaborate it myself, since i got to choose the desired topic i want, but some of my classmates had a hard time by only researching because they chose the topic from the board. Furthermore, students can observe from their teacher and get to the point, when they can think for themselves.

It is evidenced that, you can learn a lot from visualization. Most of the students go to trips, during summer time with their family ,and that will be great advantage for a student to come up with a self-designed project, as they visualize on their trip. For example, when you go to the museum, there is lot to visualize and learn from it. Self-designed projects would be complicated for some students, but most importantly, research and your effort, is required. As evidenced by the quote, "as you sow, so you reap", it means the harder you work, the better your results will be. We should always remember that, effort is valuable. Self-designed projects are very beneficial because it helps you to work as an independent individual. Furthermore, you will gain the way how you think, both physically and mentally.

In conclusion, teachers should allow students, to think for themselves' ,and allow students to choose their topics. Students-designed projects will help them think more efficiently and it is more convenient for both students and the teacher. Visualization would be an easy hint for the student to work on their project. For the solution, teachers should assign students to write a journal about, how they spent their time during the long summer break. Potentially, this will make it very easier for both students and the teachers. This will allow student to write about their real-life event ,and it will make the teacher very happy about reading student's personal summer experience.
