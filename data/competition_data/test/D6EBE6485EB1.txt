Students will not benefit from being able to attend their classes at home,because they will not stay on task. They won't take it seriously as if they were in a public school. They will also study less for tests or doing their homework ,and hang out more with their friends and play games. Four years ago when I was home- schooled

I could not focus for most of the time, because there were many distractions and I got distracted easily. Since my mother was my teacher I thought that things would be easier to accomplish, but it was actually harder. Because I did not take it seriously at first and I was not paying attention. Some students can stay focused and are able to attend their classes at home, because the comfort of their home might be a positive thing and might have a positive outcome. For me it sometimes was because things were a lot easier to accomplish at home then at school. Others may not take advantage of this opportunity and will not focus on their classes. Students won't benefit from taking class at home because they will get distracted, they won't accomplish anything at home, and some students have to be monitored by their parents in order to complete their work.

Students will get distracted if they are taking their classes at home. When I was home schooled I used to get distracted by my family,my friends, and my phone. I could not focus and stay on task as if I was in a real classroom. They will not be studying or doing their homework,they will play games or be on their phones. My friends would call me a lot of times when I was studying , and I would reply even though I should have not. Some students might be responsible enough to get their work. Their were sometimes where I could focus and get all of my work done but it was rare. They will also not get distracted by anything and stay on task. Others might hang out with their friends and not worry about school. The only way that students can have their classes at home is if they are truly capable of staying on task without getting distracted.

Students won't accomplish anything if they are taking their classes at home. They will get to comfortable at their homes, and they will not focus. They will be lazy and some students may not even attend their classes. Sometimes I would not attend some of my classes because I would either be sick or I just was tired that day. It is very common for students who get comfortable at home to skip or not attend their classes, because they are either annoyed by school or tired as well. Some students take advantage of this opportunity and use it as motivation into completing their work. While others are lazy and do not stay on task.

Students have to be monitored by their parents to take their classes at home. Most students are sometimes are watched by their parents to make sure that they complete their assignments without any distractions. Some parents confiscate their children's phones so that when they are studying or doing their homework they stay focused. There were times where my mother would take away my phone so that I could complete my work without any interruptions. Some students are not monitored my their parents because their parents are either at work, or they trust that their kid can stay focused. During my time in home school my mother would sometimes let me do my assignment without any monitoring and I got some assignments done. Parents sometimes try to get their kids out of the house so that they can study at the library so that they are not lazy and do not distracted.

Students should not be allowed to take their classes at home because they will not stay on task. They won't accomplish anything at home. They also have to be monitored by their parents sometimes to ensure that they complete their work. There are a few students who do not need their parents and can complete their tasks without get distracted. Students won't focus in their classes, they will be busy hanging out with their friends and playing games. The four years that

I was home-schooled I got distracted many times, and it took me a while to just focus in my classes. If students are allowed to take classes at home they will never accomplish anything ,and it will make it harder for them to concentrate on school.
