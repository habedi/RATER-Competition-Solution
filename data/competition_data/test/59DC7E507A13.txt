Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be required to do some community service. We all have to live in this town together so why don't we all take part in keeping it clean and a nice place to live. Community service is not just to keep things clean, but it is also to help people live a better and healthier life.

Some people don't think community service is worth the time, but those people have never taken the time to try it. They don't know the satisfaction you get when you see the smile on a person's face for doing the right thing. People always thank you and most of all you know inside that you did the right thing and that fills an emptiness inside.

Sometimes community service can be fun. If you happen to do something that you are interested in. Like maybe if you're into sports you could clean up your local sports complex. And create a better more fun facility for everyone.

Everyone that i know that has done any community service say they like it. They don't mind taking the time to do something good for someone else. Doing community service is also for your benefit, by keeping you up and active. It gives you something to do, rather than sitting at home on the coach being lazy eating potato chips and playing video games.

So I think that it would be a good idea for you to have everyone do some kind of service to help the community. So please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time and i hope this letter helps your decision.

Sincerely,

Your Student
