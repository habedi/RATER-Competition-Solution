You want to know what I think, I think we should be able to bring are cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods or any free time. But they should be turned off during class time. If students have there cell phones on during class they will not be able to focus on the material they are learning in there classes. Students will be focused on texting there friends or family and not be focused on taking there studying seriously. Also because in case there is a test teachers will accuse you of cheating because you have your phone out and access to any answer. Another reason can be is the will have bad grades. Students will act defiant. In that case student will not take there school work seriously. Grades would drop less interest will be in school if they have there phones on during class.

My point is that the we should be allowed to have phones in school. Having phones on before school, break and lunch are the only time to have access to our phones. They would probably be an emergency and be needed in any particular time and place. Also allowing us to have phones on during are breaks is not a bad thing its a time for students to relax from any school work and to have a more "fun" way to have our breaks here at school. Also phones will be needed for after school in case any body needs to get picked up from school. Students will be able to contact there parents faster then using the schools phone in case anybody has any other activity after school so they wont be late and maintain the same schedule and make us be more responsible in many ways. This is my opinion in allowing us to use our phone in are "free time" and you wont have to hide from any
