Have you ever wished you could just sit back and let your car do all the driving? Well that may happen sooner than you might think. Driverless cars technology is improving everyday and soon it will be more accessible to more people. Driverless cars are cars that do all the driving for you. You still have to be in the car ready to take over in case of an emergency. Driverless cars may sound like a cool idea but there is a lot of debate over this topic.

Personally, I think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think since we have the advancing technology we should give driverless cars a try. You would still have to be in the car ready to take control and I think that is a good idea. The problem with driverless cars is that they won't be ready for unexpected danger on the road. A good way to solve this problem is to have a driver ready to take the wheel.

A benefit of driverless cars is that they would use half the fuel taxis use and be more flexible than a bus. Reducing how much fuel we use would really help the environment. I think more people would supprt the idea of driverless cars if they knew the benefits like reducing the use of fuel.

The biggest negative effect of driverless cars is the safety. Since there is not a person behind the wheel ready to react there is a bigger risk of collisions. A computer doesn't have the time to react in that type of situation. Right now California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Comumbia are the only states allowing semi-autonomous cars to be driven. Manufacturers of these cars believe that other states will follow as soon as driverless cars are proven more reliably safe.

I really think driverless cars will be here soon in the future for everyone to drive. With developing technologies it will probably happen sooner than you might think. There are many positive and negative effects, but I think the manufactures will work them out. Driverless cars will be a positive effect on the environment and society.
