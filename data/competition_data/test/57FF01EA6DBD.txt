Aliens had nothing to do with the face on Mars, even though there may be slight evidence. The face on mars was just a natural invention, that came from piled up rocks, dust, shadows, and old storms, in my opinion it is just a crazy sight of nature.

There were excited and anxious web searchers waiting to see the image that first appeared on a JPL web site. The web searchers only found that it was a natural landform, and there was no alien monument at all.

If there were any other objects in sight for this face to have been created by aliens they would have been captured because you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than a pixel size. For example, if there was anything like small shacks, or even airplanes they would have seen them, so therefore, aliens couldnt have made this face.
