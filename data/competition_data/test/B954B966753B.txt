I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is very fun. One reason is because if you would like to see a lot of countries, you could see them on this program! Another reason is because you can take care of many animals that are on board. I think you should definitely join! It would be fun to have you here!

You would be a big help and very much appreciated if you joined. As it says in the passage, the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabiliation Administration) is also very much appreciated. The passage states,"UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas." So since my friend and I read it, we decided to sign up. Like it says in the passage, "In August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans." Which really means that my friend Don and I recieved our orders to go to New Orleans.

In conclusion, I really think you should join. This would be a great opportunity for you. You and one of your friends could sign up together. Like I said before, you would be visiting countries, and taking care of animals. I think you would really enjoy this program.
