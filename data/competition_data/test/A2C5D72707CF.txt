Venuse is a worthy pursuite despite the dangers because NASSA would get to find out about are twin planted but there are some challges and riskes, like spacecraft have only lasted a few hours or like a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blackes venuse and Venus has the hottest surface temperature. These are just a few problems we are faceing to look in to are brother planted.

Venus has the hottest surface and its not even the closes planted to the sun. Venus is a very challging planted to study because the surrface is so hot it can mealt most mealts. Venus is the most earth like planted it has all of the same weather prblems like earthquakes,lighting striks and erupting valcanoes.

Also Venus has a thick carbon dioxide blaked around it. It covers 97 percent of Venus and it has hight levels of sulfuic acid in venus. On the plates surface it is over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface of all the plates inthe solar system .

NASA has made teast and simalshions and one lasted three weeks,but they have a idea to make a type of blimp to huver 30 miles up over the planted of Venus but it would still be 170 degrees but the air pressher would be cloes to the sea leales soo it would be good to try.

Thes are just a few reasons why Venus is a good planted to explore even knowing the dangers of doing it .there are more than enughe resons to stop trying but the planted is so closes and humons and still qureuse about the planted
