When considering cell phones in school, policy number 1 is the best choice. Letting student use their phones in free periods/time is further the better choice. Student will feel trapped with choice number 2. They will feel as though they must hide their phones, and the consequences will be much worse. You may think that policy number 2 is better, but its not. Policy number 1 is, here are some reasons why.

When teachers find students using phones during class they believe it is because they simply do not want to pay attention. They see it as disrespect, therefore it is untollerated. The end result is the phone being taken away. teachers think that this solves the problem, but in the end this only worsens it. Everyday period, after period, someone loses their phones. Weather it is because of texting, phone calls etc. is not the point. We want you to greatly listen and understand to the points we have on this problem.

Teachers don't see why we may be truly using our phones. They do not have any knowledge of what goes on outside of school. Maybe the fact is we are waiting on information of a loved one, or a response from someone that has not been communicated with in a long time. We do not always use our phones for selfish reasons. Phones sometimes truly are the only meaning of communication between families. Teachers have to see that.

Teachers also think that more phones mean more possible theft. This is not true, if one is bringing a personal belonging such as a phone, we will be protecting it. Teachers have to give us those minutes of free time for our phone needs. Time in which we are allowed to use phones could possibly eliminate these problems all together. We strongly advise you to consider these points, and honestly think about whats betteer for everyone.
