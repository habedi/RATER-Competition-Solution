i believe in policy 1 because its not fear how teacher could have there phones and we cant like its not fear what if something serious was happing at home what if your the only person your parents could count on and you disappoint because your teacher wont let you have them i agree with the policy but we don't have to use them during class time we can use them during lunch and when you like go to your elective for period 4 you can use it to make your little phone call to your mom or dad and tell them how school is going and ask them how work is and then just go to your 4 period class but i' am still on the whole teacher can use there phones but students cant teachers are not fear because that they cant use there phones and we cant are phones but every time i look at them there texting or either calling someone and i just think that its not fear like once my mom was calling me to telling me to pick up my little brother from school after school can my teacher caught me and told the principal and the he took my phone away but then when she was ready to use her phone she didn't say nothing and i said i' am going to tell the principal but guess what ?he didn't do nothing that was not fear and he always says that at all time teachers and students shouldn't have there phones out at all times but why will he take my phone away from my he could have me a warning.
