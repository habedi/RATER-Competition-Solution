Dear

State Senator

I think that you should change teh Electoral College because it isnt really fare to our state trhat congress gets to pick our president. we as a state shoul get to chose on who we want to run our country, and who we want to be our leader. we should not have to pick the electors, why can we be the electors ourselves?

Some people might want there to be and Electoral College but what about the others who think that we should vote or the president and not for the election of a president by a vote in congress? 60% of the voters would prefer to direct election to th ekind we ahve know. We have to think about everyone in this case not just the ones that think the have control over everything. we should listen to everyones opinions, not saying you have to do what they say,but just listen to.

back in 1960, segregation in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy. In 1968, a shift of just 41971 votes would have deadlocked the election. The Electoral College was unfair, outdated, and irrational.
