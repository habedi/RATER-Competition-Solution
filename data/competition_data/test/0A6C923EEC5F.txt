The face found on Mars is not made by alien. On April 1998 Michael Malins took a picture that was ten times. The autor is comparing the Eath to Mars how the the Earth has a of landforms so and Mars has a landform that look like a face.

The face could have been formed like that and back then we dont have the technology we have now so the camara could have been messed up or gliching out." Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meter pre pixel in the best 1976 Viking Photo."

The way and distance of the Viking 1 spacecraft could have made a diferance from what the picture looks like then what it is in real life. The camara resulution could have been better the dhould have sent another spacecraft up were the the picture was taken to see if the rock is really a face. The rock is most likely made up of natural landform.
