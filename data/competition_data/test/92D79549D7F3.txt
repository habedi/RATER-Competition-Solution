Dear Principal,

I feel we should have the first policy. I think it is a good compromise.

The teachers and the students will both get what they want. Phones can be beneficial to the school system. Students will have to know that this is a privilege and can easily be taken away.

During free time if they have nothing to do they would be able to communicate silently with their friends. They could even get help on homework by texting someone from a different room. Some phones even have internet which could be helpful for research reports. The phones will keep the students occupied when they have nothing else to do in study halls or free periods. This will keep the classroom silent for people who really need to concentrate on their work. Talking to friends will help relieve some stress during the day and since they can't talk to all their friends because of different schedules this phone policy will help them to do that.

Teachers will also benefit from this policy because the students will hopefully follow the rules so they are able to text at their free times. Some kids will be less talkative if they were able to tell someone what they needed to tell them before the class. Also if the teachers have the students numbers they could remind them to study and do their homework.

Phones are becoming a big part of the world. Especially in the U.S. Some students will want to break the no phone rule simply because there is a rule. My grandpa always says if there are no rules you can't break any rules. As long as students realize there will be consequences and that this phone policy can easily be taken away then everything should go well.

It could take a little time to get use to so you could try this policy for a month and see how it goes. If it doesn't go well then try it again in another few months. After a while it should catch on. I feel that this will benefit the school tremendously. Please take this in consideration.
