Dear Mrs. Principle

I think that you should make students keep a B grade overall average to play sports for many reasons. I think that it would give some students something to strive for. You would see a definite change in grades. Also better actions in some students. If some students that don't play sports, and they are in clubs the same rules should apply to them. It should apply to them because it is an after school activity. Half of the school is in a club or on a sports team. So it is definitely a good choice to make us keep our averages at a B. It would lead to a better experience because it would give us scholarships to high schools for many reasons. For one our grades would be good, and if we made our sports team we are obviously good athletes. So it can lead to many opportunities. If maybe you would throw a barbeque or an ice cream party if the whole school gets an A+ on the big test. That would really make kids strive for excellence. Or maybe you could give us a free day if our grades are good. You don't have to do these things, these are just some suggestions about how to get our students to do better. They would definitely love these ideas. Just look into it if you can.

Thanks ,
