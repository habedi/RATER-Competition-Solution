There area couple of advantages to limiting car usage. The most common one would be less pollution. In larger cities pollution is a big deal with all the factories around, but some of that pollution can be redused if less car were used for transportation. To help reduse pollution, as stated in source 1 "[S]tores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."

One way to enforce limiting car usage is to do like it say in source 2 "after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." People were did not agree with the concept of not driving for the day in the begining and decided that instead of go along with not driving they would rather pay the fine, "almost 4,000 drivers were fined..., says source 2. The only car that was allowed to drive from Friday to Monday was plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. source 2 says "the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that there are less traffic jams. "[M]illions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams," says sorcure 3. Not driving to work and using alternate transportation is "...a good opportunity to take away stree and lower air pollution," says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

In source 4 President Obama said "recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." most people seem to be understand and realizing the advantanges of limiting car usuage. in some cases you may think car are very important to our lives, which they are but in other cases they are not. Just sit down and think of what life would be like without cars and you will see it would be better.
