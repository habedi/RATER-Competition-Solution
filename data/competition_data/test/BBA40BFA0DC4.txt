"If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to it's surface?" is what the author said to introduce the discussion that scientists have been having. One of the ideas that the author supports their claim was the conspiricy that venus might have been earth before earth. "Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and include familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters" and there are some evidence of previous forms of life. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. So that would be a set back on the idea of exploring the planet and also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.

NASA's possible solution to the such hostile conditions is to have a blimp-like vehicle floating above 30-50 miles in the air to study the planet. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many unfriendly ground conditions. This possible solution would put them at like 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. "Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans".

However, flying over Venus from a ship or hovering object would be safe but it would only provide limited "insight" on groung conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, More importantly researhers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else form a distance. But for me I think its a great idea, I like the solution to the issue.
