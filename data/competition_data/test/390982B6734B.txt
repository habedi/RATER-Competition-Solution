I think that we should use facial action coding because it lets use humans know that we can make things smarter or similer to use. Even though people belive that the computer is not important. The computer could do use good. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". this can give teachers a chance to know if the lessons he/she gives will help the students or not.

If we started makeing and useing facial action coding we could help kids do better in school and find better ways to help each other. " for istance you can probaly tell what your friend is feeling by the look on there face". if someone is unsure about the way they feel they can just go to the compuert and find out everyone would know them self better.

Alot of people think it will not be a good thing because it takes away natral way of life. But really this would let every one have a way of being comfortable in sertan situations. It would alow people to progress on there studys and alow them to find ways they learn best.

These are the reasons why i belive we should use facial action coding. the world would be simpler. Every one may have a chance and learning in better ways. A new way of life would be created with facial action coding.
