Friends, learning, fun, extracurricular activities provides all of these things. Extracurricular activities such as sports, the student council, and many other clubs are a great way for students to make friends and learn many skills. Many schools have extracurricular activities but not all students will attend them. Some students may not have time, friends to go with, or they just don't want to go. You may feel left out at first when joining a new club, but eventually you will make new friends and have tons of fun learning many skills. I agree with the decision that enforces students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have lots of fun, and learn important skills.

Students should be enforced to participate in extracurricular activities because they will make new friends. In a new school not everybody makes friends right away, so extracurricular activities can be a great way to find friends with similar interests. There are many different clubs and activities filled with people of similar interests. These interests help you bond with your peers as you do activities related to the interest you share. Such as in many sports teams, you won't know all your teammates instantly. As the season goes on you will begin to learn more about them as you bond with them. Teams can never be great if the players always fight with each other. You must learn to work together as a team to win and in doing so you will become much closer to each other. At the end of the season you will realize, the teammates who started out complete strangers turn out to being some of your best friends. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for many students to find many friends while bonding in their similar interests.

Students should be enforced to participate in extracurricular activities because they will have lots of fun. As there are many different extracurricular activities, surely you will find one that suits your interests. Instead of doing these activities alone you will have friends to do them with. Doing things by yourself isn't always the best. Sometimes the things you loved might not be fun, but when your with friends they will make things interesting. It won't be the same boring game with the same story line every time. Things will be different, interesting, there will be change, and you will have more fun. You might have been the best at a video game at your old school, but as you will be introduced to new people in the club you might find someone on a similar level. The old spark that died out is back to life as you want to improve. The game that became too easy it was no longer fun, now has some challenge and your interest is back. Extracurricular activities can be a great place to have tons of fun renewing your interests, finding new interests, and spending time with friends.
