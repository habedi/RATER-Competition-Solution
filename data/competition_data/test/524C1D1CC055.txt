Title: Phones and Driving

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. I personally think people should not use their phone and drink. Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and accidents. Distracted driving has become a dangerous practice on our streets and highways. Aside from the statistics of numbers of crashes, deaths and injuries, here are some graphics that can show you just what it is you're doing when you choose to text and drive, why it is so dangerous, and what can be done to prevent it.

When using your phone and driving at the same time it can be very dangerous to you, the passengers in the car and other drivers around you. Five seconds is the minimal amount of time your attention is taken away from the road when you're texting and driving.

If you're traveling at fifty-five mph, then that means you will drive the length of a football field without looking at the road.

A person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while sending a text message, than if they were only driving. That number towers over the other activities associated with distracted driving.

Most drivers think they can multitask by sending a quick message or reading a quick message. Seventy-one percent of teens and young people say they have composed or sent SMS messages while driving according to NHTSA.gov. Seventy-eight percent of teens and young adults say they have read an SMS message while driving according to NHTSA.gov. Text messages makes a car crash up to twenty-three times more likely to happen.

A big part of the problem is that people don't think it's a problem. Seventy-seven of young adults are very or somewhat confident that they can safety text while driving.

Fifty-five of young adult's drivers claim it's easy to text while driving. But it is a problem, teens and adults who text while driving spend approximately ten percent of their driving time outside of their lane.

Texting and driving or even using your phone while driving is very dangerous.

Despite the laws forbidding texting and driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text and drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people that could have been a very per cautious and they lose lives every day because of careless drivers. Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things on the road today due to all of this technology, and they will not stop making this technology just because people are getting in accidents stop the text stop the wrecks. Take the pledge to stop texting and driving.
