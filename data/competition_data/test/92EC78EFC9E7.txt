Nowadays does everyone rely on cars frequently, and as of late has this practise begun to show its numerous negative effects, of which shall be discussed. The articles presented by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robbert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky portray the effects of such frequent use of cars and effort many areas are already making to limit car usage; the articles also explore the many benefits of limiting car usage such as reduction of pollution.

Some large and global cities, such as Paris, are known for the substantial amount of pollution present in their air. According to Source 2: "Paris bans drivin due to smog", Paris already has more smog than other European capitals in general with one hundred forty-seven micrograms of particulate matter per one cubic metre. In comparison to Brussel's one hundred fourteen micrograms and London's seventy-nine and seven tenths, Paris' pollution is clearly more concentrated. According to Source 4: "The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the United States features broad expanses and many suburbs, being one of the places in the world where cars are greatly centred upon by the people. Thus can one imagine the exceptionally negative impact that cars most likely have on the air quality of the urban and suburban areas throughout the United States. Elizabeth Rosenthal's Source 1: "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" states that the widespread use of automobiles worldwide are one of the greatest obstacles to overcome in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are from cars and even up to fifty percent are from cars in the United States. This furthermore leads on to the many benefits that limits on car usage have to offer and the efforts certain areas are making to create these benefits.

Source 1 provides some useful insight efforts on the possibilities and advantages of limiting car use over continuing the mainstream automobile trend. Vauban is a community in Germany near France and Switzerland, on the outskirts of Freiburg. Here is where parking areas in streets, driveways, and home garages are infrequent to find or are outright forbidden. Only two places are available for parking, which are the large garages at the edge of the community, with parking spaces going out for forty thousand dollars. In Vauban, only thirty percent of the population own cars, and fifty-seven percent of people sold their cars in order to move here. Apparently, the lack of automobiles seems to have a calming effect as is professed by Heidrun Walter, who is quoted from Source 1: "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Source 2 show how Paris had to create a driving ban temporarily due to smog. Car traffic was lowered to sixty percent in Paris after a week of the smog and the ban helped to clear this outbreak so commuting could resume to its regular ways without impediment from the heavy pollution. Andrew Selsky's Source 3: "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota", Bogota of Colombia had a day imposed where cars were banned and only buses and taxis were permitted. This was imposed to support alternative transportation as well as to reduce the amount of smog in the city, similar to the ban Paris has imposed. Although there was rain that same day, it did not stop people from participating, and similar to  Heidrun Walter's comment in Source 1, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." The campaign for these Days Without Cars began in the  mid-1990s and has resulted in construction of one hundred eighteen bicycle paths and  major public work repairs of sidewalks and blooming of parks and sports centers. Restrictions imposed during rush-hour have reduced traffic greatly in a positive way and new shopping districts and restaurants are appearing constantly. Even in the great urban automobile centres of America, vehicle use seems to be reducing, as presented in Source 4. Acording to an analysis by Doug Short, a member of an investment research company called Advisor Perspectives, miles driven in the United States has slowly fallen since 2005; it is apparent that if the pattern continues, carbon emissions and the environment will be positively impacted to a substantial extent. Even Bill Ford, CEO of the Ford Motor Company, has porposed a business plan for a world in which ownership of a vehicle is undesirable, a place where walking, biking, low use of private cars, and public transportation is woven together to conserve resources, decrease emissions, and increase the level of urban safety.

As shown, such a level of car limitation would be highly beneficial to everyone as a whole. There would be less pollution, driving would be safer, and the urban economy would spring as more people walk or bike to transport themselves. Bill Ford's idea of a world where owning a car is impractical would be highly viable, and the city of Vauban has already begun the move. Areas without choking pollution, congested traffic, and a simpler and more tranquil life overall result  from the restriction of car usage.
