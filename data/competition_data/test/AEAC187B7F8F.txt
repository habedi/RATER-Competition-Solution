Venus our sister planet, with her surface being the harshes of the other planets and her breathtaking carbon dioxide atmosphere that takes up 97%. Venus been looked at for years as the next planet to visit,as so is Mars but lets talk to her yet,Venus has been studied to know that their had been life on her before and what causes the carbon dioxide and what forces the planet to keep its posure. Venus is a really complicated planet and the thought of visiting could be harmful.

As in the 1800s devices where invisioned but not in that way,since World War 2 computers were first looked at in 1940s and the technology they had back them was even close to compare to modern day,as they were slow to load and ares was fast to load .

But think even with modern day technology,we do still fail to communicate so what if we try to vist Venus and then the connection with the commanding officer is lost and now your space floating and that their is a real danger.

So maybe going to venus is not bad idea but its an idea that won't happen but who knows, lets not see whose survives the longest.

But my conclution is why does Venus have to be the go to planet, despite all the carbon dioxide and her 800 degrees Fahrenheit. I know why we picked Venus becaouse it's the exact size of us and the 2nd closes to the sun.
