The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit by including many details that, despite the dangers of venus, we have ways in which we can get past those dangers to complete a fully devolped exploration of Venus. There are a few ways the author goes about doing this: telling us how venus couldve been like earth, how NASA has a few ideas on how to make the exploration safe and about the different technology they scientist would use to study venus.

Long ago venus couldve been considered another earth-like planet of life. in the text it states, " Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth". This would encourage any scientist to want to explore more into the planet to try and figure out what went wrong, even though it is close to the sun but still has earth like features, what is the problem? Venus still, to this day, has features of earth like mountains and valleys and rocky sediment, but is still not liveable on because of some conditions. In the end it could be like another planet we could visit because it is so close to earth, but we have to find some way to get there safely.

In order to do a successful research of venus, you have to first get there safely, and NASA has an idea to do that. The author introduces NASA's idea in paragraph 5 stating "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of

Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." Just like our airplanes and jets, scientist would be able to float above the atmosphere of venus because of the risky temperatures and conditions. It would allow them to avoid unfiendly ground conditions and stay out of the way for anything to come. Even though it wouldn't protect you from every little hassle of Venus, the air pressure would still be close enough to that of earth and the conditions will still be survivable for humans.

Once you get there, you would need something to conduct your research or study with, so having durable equipment would help you get your job done. First of all, the author states in the text "Some siplified electronics made of silicone carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." This would allow scientist to conduct an expirement well enough to find out more about venus. They could use the electronics made of silicone carbide to help them make longer observations , than those of modern equipment that would melt rather quickly because of Venus's conditions. In adition to the silicone carbide, NASA has also been working on bringing back mechanical computers, used in WW II that use levers and gears to make calculations. Those computers are more resistant to heat and pressure.

And finally with the idea of how Venus could've been like earth, the different ways on how to make the exploration safe and the different technology that would be used to study venus, one can conclude that venus is not only worthy of a pursuit but is also a way of creating value and expansion.
