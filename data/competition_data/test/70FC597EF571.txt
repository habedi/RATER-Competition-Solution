Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I feel that it is inappropriate to have a average grade of a B in all classes to participate in all school athletics. Most students have an average grade of a C. The reason that this is probably happening is because the schools overall grade is low but their must be something that can be done so that you can have an average of a C to be in sports because many kids would have to quit sports that they love just because they are having to go above an average student. Many kids do sports at our school and that is why we win so many tournaments but if many of those students have a test average of a C then Farnell will loose their reputation and the students will blame you. If students are required to have a grade average that high many students may transfer to different schools or find different teams to join. So just by raising the grade average it wont do anything their will just be less kids participating in student athletics at our school. Most students have an equal balance between homework and practicing for games and going outside but if the grade average is higher then they` re will be less kids playing outside because they will struggle to get good grades then they will be kicked off their teams because they haven't been practicing enough. So in my opinion the average grade for sports should be a C or up.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
