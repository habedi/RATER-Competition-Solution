The rule of making a grade "B" average to play sports is tough in my opinion. I understand the whole concept of this argument is to try and make the students work harder in school. I personally think this is a tough argument because yes, the students might try harder, but you will also have cases of students not understanding the work being given to them, which makes this proposition invalid.

I personally am a straight "A" student. I see what goes on everyday in the classroom first hand. The thing that is wrong with this argument is effort. I know/see a lot of people trying hard everyday to complete the task given to them but they just can't seem to understand it. A grade "B" average is too hard in my opinion based on the fact just listed. Like I said earlier people do get lazy and in a lot of cases that is why they have poor grades. A "B" grade average it too much though because there is no way to tell which students are trying and which are not, therefore it would be unfair to the students that want to play sports but don't understand school subjects.

The last argument I am going to make is the problem of parents. Having a grade "B" average would make a lot of parents upset because even if their student is not trying, they are going to be on the kids side most of the time. This rule would create more trouble than what it is actually worth. A grade "C" average is fine in my opinion because it shows that you are an average student. Having good grades is a thing that you have to want, not anyone else.
