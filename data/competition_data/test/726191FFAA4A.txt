School has a variety of activities for students and I think that everyone should participate in at least one of them. The reasons that I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity is that they could learn something, they could find a new interest in one,and they can step out of their comfort zone. If students participate in these activities they may discover new likes,dislikes, and talents that could effect their future.

When people discover something new they often times learn things that could benefit them and those around them. If students do the same thing they could think of new ideas and strategies based on what they have learned. You never know what kinds of things you could learn unless you try something new. Generic_Name has decided to start baseball and he thought of a great strategy that ended up helping them at one of their baseball games. If Generic_Name hadn't joined the baseball team the game would have gone alot differently and their team wouldn't have such a valuable player. This is one of the reasons why I think students should participate in a extracurricular activity.

Some students in the school keep to themselves a lot of time and don't want anything to do with other people. But if they try something new they may find that they like it. Students could find hidden talents that they never knew they had and that could effect their future. Generic_Name is a really quiet student and her parents decided to sign her up for the art club. Generic_Name grew to love the art club and decided to persue a carerr path as an artist. If Generic_Name never joined the art club she would have never found a talent that she had and grew to love. This is another reason why I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity.

Finally, the last reason I think students should participate in an activity is that students can step out of their comfort zone. I think that people should be willing to try new things even if it means stepping out of your comfort zone. You will never learn anything if you avoid other things and people. Generic_Name has never liked any sports but she decide to try vollyball and she ended up really liking it. Generic_Name tried something that she really disliked and ended up changing her opinion on it. This is why I think that students should try one extracurricular activity.

School has many different activities for kids to learn and have fun with. It does'nt matter whether your shy or nervous you can still learn something new and end up enjoying it. This is why I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity.
