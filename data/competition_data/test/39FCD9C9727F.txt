Even during the summer, learning new material is important for students so that they can maintain their knowledge. Therefore, requiring students to complete summer projects is a great way to allow them to keep learning even outside of school. However, these projects would be best if they were teacher-designed, rather than if they were student designed. This is because teachers would be able to provide the projects with more reliable information and content than students who most likely would not be very experienced in the content. Also, students may not put much effort into their projects if they designed it, in order to make it less difficult for themselves, whereas teachers would make sure to design the projects in a way that would allow the students to put in the effort to learn the content. Lastly, teachers would be able to make the projects both educating and entertaining in order to fit the students' desires.

Allowing teachers to design the summer projects for students would ensure that the students are provided with well-known and reliable content. For example, if the teacher were to design a math project with math problems or scenarios, it would most likely not have any mistakes and contain problems that the students would be able to solve. Whereas if the students were to design the projects that they didn't have much knowledge on, there would be a high chance that they may have made a mistake in the problems and as a result, affect their learning as well. Therefore, it would be less risky to allow these summer projects to be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are learning the right content that they need.

Many students would argue that summer break should not include any schoolwork, therefore, assigning them to create a summer project would only influence them to create a project that is not educational, which would not benefit them in learning the content. For instance, if the student were completely against doing any schoolwork over their summer break but were still assigned with designing a science project, they would most likely design the project to be effortless, so that they could get it done as fast as they could, and not teach them any content. In order to ensure that the student does put in the effort to actually learn the information, it would be more beneficial to give them teacher-designed projects, which would provide them with the right level of effort that they would need to put into their work.

In fact, a number of students do not even have much knowledge on how to create a well enough project that would best educate them. Therefore, teacher-designed projects would be able to suit the students' needs and provide them with information that would benefit them the most. In addition to this, teachers would be able to design the projects so that they could entertain the students as well as educate them. For example, the teacher could design a math game as a project, where the student could have fun playing the game as well as learn the math material. As a student just now learning the content, it would be best to have more experienced teachers create the projects in order to suit the students' level of knowledge on the specific content as well as their desire to be entertained.

As a result, summer projects should most definitely be teacher-designed, as it would be more reliable, educating and entertaining. In the long run, the students would be more likely to learn the content without any mistakes and have fun learning it as well. Even if there are still many students who absolutely object the idea of teacher-designed projects, it would be best for them to keep in mind that these projects would do more to help than hurt them in their later years of school. In addition, these projects would give those students a head start in their learning and be more beneficial to help them maintain their knowledge for the rest of their school years.
