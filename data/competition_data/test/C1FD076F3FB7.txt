What I would say to a person who thinks that the face on Mars was created by aliens is this , for one we have never found any living things besides bateria and organisims on another plant. The reason why I say this is because NASA has no proof besides what they think is a face created by aliens on Mars. I have watched many shows about space and other shows like Brian Games. Brian Games had a show about faces, and it said that you can see an object and make it look human or make it look like a face, such as a specific flower that might look like a face. This is what those scientists are doing in this very situation. They are mistaking a natural made land form on Mars as an alien build face. There are many ways this landform could have been made. It could have been made by wind and rocks blowing across what you could say is a landscape. As you can see from the landform is that it has faided away over time and now looks like a lump of sand, which wouldn't you think if aliens made that they would fix it up and make it look like a face again? So this is my argument on why I believe that this is just a natural made landform.
