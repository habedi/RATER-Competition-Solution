Classes online sound like a good idea, I'm agree with this idea, but I,m also disagree for some negative reasons and problems, I also thing the best way to learn is the classic way, going to the school, so the reasons to why I'm agree with it, can be the easy way to have more attendance of the students, because some students lose their buses, wake up late, get sick or also they wake up tire because they also have jobs and don't go to school for that reason, also it can increase some students grades for attendances, and with the online classes they don't gonna have that attendance problems, it also positive for those students who work, because they don't have to worried for their schedules, or worried for their enegy for the day, and i'm also agree, because me as a student in some way fell more confortable study at home; those are my reasons to why I'm agree, but I'm also disagree for some others things, like the students who have problems to learn, some students needs some one to help them in some problems of the class or about other theme and it's more hard for the teacher to explain something specific from a computer, and it's more easy to explain at school, in person; also some students don't have the same consentration them others, and make them study at home, can be a problem because at home they can be distracted by a lot of things, like their phone, t. v or some other electronic device; also, some students who don't take the class serious, and the teacher can't take the problem as the same way as school; those reasons take me to why i think, the best way to learn is going to school, as the classic way; teachers can explain their themes more better and answer their students more easy and with better examples at school, also the student can understand the teacher more easy and it can facilitate their work, also with that way to learn people don't have any problems from old times to now and with that way to teach big entrepreneurs came to the world; the problem of the attendance is not like a big massive problem at school, because the students who want a good education are taking their education more serious and with more effort, and try to don't have any loss class, those students who are worried of their future don't gonna lose their opportunity to graduate and have a better future and became a better person with more opportunities, so finally those are the reasons to why I think the best way to learn is going to school and not with distance learning; so those are all my reasons to why I'm agree and disagree to the idea to have distance learning, and my personal opinion to what can be better for the students learning and my answer to why I thing goinng to school is the better way to learn.
