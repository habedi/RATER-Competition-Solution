Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Considering changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average is not a good idea. Changing the rule is not a good plan because most of the students have a C grade average.

A C is not a bad grade, C is considered average. I no most principles want there school to be the best but not everyone can be great. To meet the grade point average of a B is hard because most colleges grade point average is a C.I know colleges are a lot harder then middle school but are brains aren't as developed as the college students. Changing the average is not fair to us because we haven prepared to have to get a B if you want to do sports or other activities. If this was given to us in sixth grade we might have been able to do it but not on such short notice. It puts too much pressure on us students if we have to get a B average if we want to do out of school activities. If we don't get a B but a C are parents might get mad at us for no reason. A C is not the best of grades but it is not bad. If we have a C plus average in college you can play sports. Some people might have counter arguments like a C is not a good grade and if you study hard enough you can have a b average. But its middle school, if it was high school it would be okay. What if you have all B' s but one D? You would not be able to participate in any after school activities. All I am asking is to think before you change the rule.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
