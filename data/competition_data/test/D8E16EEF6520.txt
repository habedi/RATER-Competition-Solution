To whomever it may concern:

I think that (policy one) students should be allowed to bring there cell phones to school is better. I find this better because if students had a time to use their phones during school time the urge to take it out during class time would be lower because they would know they could check it at the lunch period or a different free time during the day.

The most affective thing to do is allow them to use them at the school period so that they can get there "fix." The allowance could reduce the amount of cases in which students take they're phones out and use them during class time. To allow phone use at school would be a drastic change for both the students and the teachers and administrators this would take some getting used to but I find that this would be a change for the better.
