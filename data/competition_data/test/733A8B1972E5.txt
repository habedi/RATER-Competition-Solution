In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" I think driverless cars is a bad idea. It could harm people inside the car if anything goes wrong. If anything does go wrong with the car and if it hurts someone or even kill someone, manufactures will be blamed for the accident. The people wouldnt be able to trust the company anymore and the company will start to lose money beacuse people would stop buying their cars.

Developing these types of cars sound very cool, but the safety of these self-driven cars is a big concern. No one would want to take the risk of any problems with the car that could lead to their death. In paragarph 9 in the article it says " if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?" the manufacturer should be responible if anything goes wrong. They should be responsible because they made the car and after one injury they should just stop the company of making more because they will continue to hurt people will their product. Somethign could go wrong with the car without alerting the driver and it could go out of control without anyway to stop the car.

Human drivers should have 100% control of their car, because if anything goes wrong it will be against the driver not the car. people trust them selfs better than the car. Some cars cant even handle driving their selfs on their own in some tasks and what if it doesnt alert the driver to take over, this could seriously lead to big accident.

If an accident does happen everything will be blamed against the company. The company will have charges agaisnt them. The company will be force to shut down before another accident can occur. The cars will be seen unsafe to drive, this will give a reason to the people not to buy these types of cars. If people stop buying self-driven cars the company will go bankrupt and everything will go to waste.

If new technology is taking over like cars, no one will know how to fix the car without help of the manufacters who knows what is going on. people wouldnt want to be charged just for them to check on the car and to know whats going on.

This is why I think this is a bad idea. People can get hurt or even killed. I rather stay in control of the car than let a computer take over.
