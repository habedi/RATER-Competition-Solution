Dear state senator,

I strongly believe that we should change the Electoral College because voting should be up to the citizens and should be done by the most popular vote. In the end, its us who have to deal with whoever gets picked for U.S. president. While they just pick what they decide is best. It is unfair for the voters because in reality it doesn't really matter what the chose, the Electoral College is what really makes the big impact. There are many supporting reasons for this agrument such as in paragraph 14,13, and 10.

First off, in paragraph 14 it states that the Electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. In other words it is irrelevant to what the people think its just what they want. so that being said we need to abolish this option during voting.

Secondly, in paragraph 13 it shows that seventeen states did not even see the canidates . they didn't even see a single campaign ad so  how are they supposed toknow whos running for the spot ? They don't because the Electoral colleges don't really make it happen because it's not like it matters anyways.

Lastly, in paragraph 10 the electors are anyone that is not holding public office . and in parargaph 11 it says that the Electoral College can be a disaster factor. So technically the legislatures are responsible for the president.

All together, i am against the Electoral Colleges because they dont make sense and are very unfair to the voters and people that seriously are into it. We should not have them.
