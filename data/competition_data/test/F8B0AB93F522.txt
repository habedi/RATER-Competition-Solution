Dear principal ...

wrote this letter to tell you that it is completely unfair that you would change the school policy to it being that you have to have a grade B average to be in sports or other activities like that. First of all most of the kid in the school don't even have a grade B- average to start with so that means that there will be lesser kids in the different clubs or activities so they will have to shut it down and the kids will start leaving the school because there are no good clubs in the school, and then school will sooner or later shut down.

I guess i could see the reason why you would change the policy you might think kid will try harder to get a B average and maybe some kid might but those are only the kids whose parents will not let them change schools but over all that might be at least 26 percent of the kids who have lower than a B average and is definitely not going to be enough to keep the clubs or the school open. i really how you put to mind what i have to say.

sincerely
