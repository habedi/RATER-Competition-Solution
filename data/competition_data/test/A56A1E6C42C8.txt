Well in his artical "Driving Cars Are Coming" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of the driverless cars.

Lets start off by poining the good aspects out about the diverless cars. All of the driverless cars are forms of public-transport taxi systemes. They are more flexibility then a bus is.

Also let me point out that these (Driverless cars) have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. So therefore you know they are safe cars on one hand and on another hand they are not safe cars.

Let me give you some bad aspects about the driverless car. Some of those bad aspects would be that so far google cars are not truly driverless cars. They stiil need a driver to take over when pulling in or out of the driveway or dealing with trafic issues such as roadworks or accidents.

These are some positive and negative reason on way the driverless car is heplful an no-heplful.
