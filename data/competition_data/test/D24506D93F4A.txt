If we have a policy saying that you have to have a B average to play in sports, you would not have a lot of good people playing the sport. Maybe the person is good a basketball but he has a C average but a C is still a passing grade so if he kept that C he should be able to still play sports and pass that grade. Some people are trying to make good grades but they have bad study habits or just don't get what to do. It is not right to make people quit something they like to do because of there grades, he maybe good at playing that sport but he may no be really smart.

If kids don't have enough time to study they can reduce practice little bit. With taking away sports from some kids they may go out side and get into drugs and throw there whole life away. If they do drugs and may other people do what would the community look like, just a bunch of people doing drugs. Many people want to go pro but without live action play they wont be able to reach there goals they have set for themselves.

Some people are very athletic and they love to play sports but they can't since they have a C average, but they are trying there hardest in school. If many students have a C average and they are into sports you might as well take it away from everybody so that there will be no sports at all, by doing that they may get a B average or higher. Everybody try's there hardest in school but just aren't smart and they get something lower than a B, at least they tried there hardest it's not like they are trying to fail. If they are trying to get good grades and the teacher sees that the person is trying they should let him play sports until he gets a F or doesn't try in school. Many kids would be mad and wouldn't try in school if made C average policy so you should scrap the idea and think of some different policy.
