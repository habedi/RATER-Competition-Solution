Are you happy the way you vote today, would you be happy if we were to change the way we vote for president. Because they are thinking to change the electroal vote. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it has been doing us good for a long time, and if we do change it, it would take a while for us to get used to it.

The first reason why it think that we shouldnt change the Electoral College is because it has been doing us good for almost 300 years. Let me ask you a question, do you change or fix something thats not broken,Than why change the Electoral College. We have had fair Elections in the pass and we still do, people vote for who they want as president of the united states, and if they get the better half of the votes than they are president. As we saw in 2012 when "Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for himÂ  and Romney....because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all- basis, even a cery slight popularity in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state" which is in source 3.

The second reason why I think that we should keep the electoral college is because it would take time for us to get used to the new method. Since we vote every 4 years and if we get a new way to vote there will be a few that wont know how to vote the new way and when it comes for it to vote again people will forget how they voted for the president. So if they vote for the person who they actually dont want its not like they can vote again. But as I said earlier its easy to vote with the Electoral College as its a winner takes all. The electoral vote does have a couple flaws that could be changed easily but in all other ways the elctoral vote is the way to go.

And thats why I think that we should keep the electoral College because one it hasd been doing us good and it will take us a while to get used to the new voing system.
