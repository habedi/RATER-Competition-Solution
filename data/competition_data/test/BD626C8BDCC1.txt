In 2019 alone there was a reported factor of 8.5% of fatal motor vehicle crashes due to distracted drivers. In 2018 the reported number of deaths due to cell phone and electronic device use was 4,637 people. Distracted driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving. Sending a text message,using your GPS or talking on a cell phone is considered as distracted driving .For this very reason sum states have looked into coming up with a way to prevent drivers from being distracted.

According to the new law that was passed on May 2,2018 anyone driving in the state of Georgia is to abide by the "No Hands Law". With this law being in effect,this means any and every person behind the wheel shall not have a phone in their hand or have it touching any part of their body while behind the wheel. If you are caught with the phone in your hand the penalties wi be for your First offense will be a $50.00 fine , Second offense will be a $100.00 fine, and the Third offense is at

$150.00 fine. Points will also be added to your drivers record. Once you accumulate too many points within a certain period of time your license will be suspended or revoked. In addition your insurance premium will increase.

In essence my belief is that drivers should not be able to have a electronic device in their possession,while behind the wheel. The reason I believe this is because there are entirely too many deaths because of distracted drivers. Taking your attention from the role may harm or kill a person. Distracted driving may also cause devastation for family. It may also put a financial burden on families which can affect them mentally as well as physically.

Could you imagine what would happen if people just put down their phones? Can you imagine how many people's lives will be saved? All it takes is for you to put our phone down while driving .You are not only jeopardizing your life but the lives of others citizens as well. The very few seconds that are taken for reading a text message can be the very seconds that can take or harm a life.

There is no other feeling worse than taking the life of someone else's family member. Having to watch that family grieve and bury their loved ones can hunt you for the rest of your life. As responsible drivers remember we are not only driving for ourselves but others as well. Let's all step up and pledge today to participate in the no hands law. This will automatically lead to less accidents and safer driving.
