Dear TEACHER_NAME

I agree with policy 1: that students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them at lunch but they have to be turned off in class. Because what if they need someone in their family in the middle of the day or if their family has to get a hold of them. If they are on in class and go off then you can tack them away but if the are on in the morning on the patio i think that it is ok but not in class when they get to lunch they can use them because i would like that. But if the are in the lunch room then they should be turned off because they have to in class so they should be in the building because that is rude if some one is talking and a cell phone goes off it would be good if that was the new rule in the school. I think that it is not fair for the teacher to get to use their cell phones and not the students.

I think that policy one: that the student can use their cell phones. An can be on out side and not get taken away, but when they go inside the cell phone has to be turned off if they are not and they go off they should get taken away and their parents should have to come and get them or they can get them after school or when ever the teacher said that they can come back and get them so that is why i think the policy 1that cell phones should be used only outside school and not inside the class rooms is how the cell phone policy should be in the school i hope that i have told you some stuff that will help you in your choice if cell phones should be allowed or not be allowed in school.
