I feel that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not very valuable. Even though I feel that this new way of technology is pretty cool. I don't think that it is something that is really needed in a classroom.

In paragraph six Dr Huang predicts that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or boerd,- Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor". This may help the instructor greatly with teaching, and being able to know how their students are feeling. But, I think that as a teacher you should be asking questions, and making sure that the material you are teaching is being understood by all your students. And if it is not, you should find a way to help your students understand. You shouldn't depend on technology when, it is your job to know when the students are becoming boerd or confused. So, that you can make your classroom a better learning environment for everyone in the classroom.

Sometimes even though it may not be the best thing to do, students like to keep in their emotion of how they are feeling and don't want the entire classroom to know it. This new way of technology could be a great addition to a classroom for experiments once in awhile, but shouldn't be a major part of the classroom.
