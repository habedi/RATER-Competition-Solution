Exploring venus, Venus is sometimes called the evening star it is the brightest points of light in the dark sky, It makes it simple for amateur stargazer to spot it this nickname for it is misleading, venus is actually a planet in the solar system, venus is second over from the sun, Venus is very easy to spot it is a safe vantage point of earth it has a very challenging place to look at more closely. venus reffered to as a twin from the earth venus is actually one of the closes that means size and density, our planetary neighbor knows that that it oribit the sun at diffrent speeds.

A atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus. A even more challanging is the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On our planet's surface the tempature can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and that is really hot, The atmospheric pressure can be 90 times greater than what we can experience on our planet. The conditions are more extreme than we can encounter, Venus is the hottest surface tempature of any planet in the world, Mercury is closer to the sun high pressure and heat can geology and present additional impediments like erupting colcanoes every where earthquakes and some lightning probes seeking to land on surface.

Nasa has particularly idea to send human to study and discover venus. The possible solution to the hostile condition is the surface of venus we would allow scientists to float above. Dream like there is a blimp-like car floating 30 miles roiling to venusian landscape. Our jet planes can travel higher and they can fly over many storms and a vehicle hovering up there would not be a good idea.

Nasa is working on other approaches to get to venus some simplieifed the chaos of venus surface and have lasted for a long time in such conditions just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comaprison systems that use mechanical part can be more resistant to pressure and heat in the atmophere.
