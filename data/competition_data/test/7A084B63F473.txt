Dear principal,

I don't agree with you changing the school policy. Even if the students that have a C average. The students that have a C average should be able to participate in other activities and sports. they are not dumb, they are just good at other things or activity's but they are not that great at school. They should be able to participate so they don't have to suffer the consequence. also to be social and communicate with others. This is what i think about this topic:

They should be able to participate because so they don't have to pay the consequences.

They can just take their mind of the school work and have fun, interact with others. They may also change in how to become a better student, by the activity teacher giving them tips on how to be a good student, or the student realizing that he needs to change by doing better in school, and will learn how to change with their teachers advice.

The students that have a C average can talk with the students that have a B average and ask them for tips or even help them with H.W. they can be friends with them, they both can have questions for each other. It will help them become more social and a good student. they can actual get better grade's and be proud of themselves and not feel stupid.

This is why i think that the students that have a C average should participate in school activities and sports.

From your student,
