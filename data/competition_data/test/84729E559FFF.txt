So, I was walking down the street the other day, in my NASA uniform, when a conspiracy theorist stops me to ask me a few questions about the Face on Mars. "Sir, I am with the Conspiracy Theorist League, or the CTL. I just wanted to ask you a few questions about the supposed Face on Mars. My coworkers and I think that the Face is a remnant of an alien civilization. We would like to hear your opinion on the subject." "Well," I began begrudgingly, because these guys had no idea what the Face really is. "The face is really just a mesa whose shadows made it look like a face at first glance." I said. "Really?" The CTL representative says. "How fascinating. The real question, though, is what proof do you have that you are not lying to us." "Well, for one thing, NASA wouldn't benefit from the keeping the discovery of aliens away from the population. Two, our images have shown us that the face is really just a hill, nothing more, nothing less. Also, the Face is in an area that is full of mesas just like it, so it would be absurd to think that the Face is anything but a mesa." "Alright then, thank you for your time." The CTL representative says as he walks away.
