In away I do agree with this then I don't. In my own opinion I think that if you cant have a b average than you should not have the privilege to play any sports. By you not playing any sports or other activities its giving you the time to study and so you can improve on your grades. Also by you not being able to play any sports or activities it is making you upset because you see your friends playing in activities and other events because they earned the privilege to play and have some feel time and that will make you want to improve on your grade, by studying and making up any type of work you missed. Then you will be able to join your friends. I do not agree with this in away because you should have a little time to yourself were you can just be yourself, and not worry about anything else. I feel that if you have a c or above that is good because you are passing. And it does not matter what your grades are as long as you are trying as hard as you can to improve. That is why I agree and disagree to this thought of change.
