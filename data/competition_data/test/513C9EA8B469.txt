Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There are many pros and cons to requiring students to do community service. Some parents might not agree with it so you might want to talk to them about it first to give your opinion and to tell them a little more about what's going on. When you're talking to the parents, you should keep in mind that there are many pros and cons to requiring students to do community service.

The cons of requiring students to do community work is plentiful even if there are pros to counteract it. One of the cons is that even if the students are required to do it, it might not teach them anything or help anyone in the process. For example, they might try to help people but they don't want to do it and that shows and changes how everything works out. It might be helpful but they won't be taught responsibility because if they don't care about it, they don't want to learn anything about it, I know this from my own experience. Another con is that if they don't care about it, they more than likely won't do a good job on it. They're lacking of the ability to want to do it, and to enjoy it, and to actually try. If they don't want to, like most of them don't because if they wanted to they would have volunteered by now, they won't try and they won't care how it turns out. They don't care how it's affecting things or what the consequences might be. Another con is that most of them would have to give up some sports, or there homework time, or even their free time which I know most of them wouldn't be very happy about. Another con is parents, some parents are over-protective and don't want their children doing stuff like that, some parents don't want their kids to help other kids, and other parents might not want their children doing that work. So, there is a good amount of cons we would have to pay attention to and give it some thought.

Now we have the pros, which are also plentiful. One pro to having students being required to do community service is that it might teach them responsibility. If they do it and start to care about what they're doing to help people and their world (ecosystem) then it would get them to keep doing that and have other people try it. Plus if they do that, it teaches them more responsibility. For example, if they're picking up trash, they will realize all the work they have to do and that might change something in their brain and think that they shouldn't litter not only because it's bad for the environment but also because there is a certain amount of work involved to pick all of it up and keep it maintained. Another thing is that it can keep them active. If they're helping outside or working hard, it keeps them active. Obesity is a growing problem in our world and to keep kids active would be very helpful. For example, if they're outside picking up trash, they are walking around and not staying inside watching television or texting or playing video games. They're actually out and about and that not only would help our obesity problem but also help make our world green and bountiful. So, there are all the pros, and there's probably more that we can tell the parents to make them understand and maybe get them to agree with us to make our world a better place.

If you can't already tell, I am mutual on this, I think it's a good idea but I know there will be some problems. I think you should suggest it to the kids and see what they think. After all, we'll be taking over soon, it's our generation's time to shine. Let's make this world a place to remember, and to remember that we helped make it this way.

sincerely,
