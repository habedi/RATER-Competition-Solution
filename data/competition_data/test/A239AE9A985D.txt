Dear Principal:

Since many students enjoy using their cell phones during school times and cannot go without texting their friends or family I think that you should allow use of them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class times.

The first reason why I think this policy should be in place is because of emergencies. Many students may need to call their parents incase of getting hurt or maybe have been bullied. That would let the parents know that their is problems going on with that student before he/she is able to go tell a teacher. Since most bullying happens during lunch periods or even in the hallways the student getting bullied has the upper hand by calling a parent or even the police.

This would prevent any serious damage.

The second reason why I think that this policy should be in place is because it gives students the freedom that is sometimes needed. When a student gets to text or call, he/she feels that they belong in this school and feel open. This can lead to a better learning process and even better grades. When students know that they have rights in this school to use their phones, they then feel like they have a right to make themselves do better.

Finally, the last reason why I think this policy should be in place is incase of a student doing good in school. If a student is doing good in school and has good grades the first person he/she would want to tell is their parents. If students are allowed to call or text during free times, that student can tell his/her parents that they did good and the parents can have something ready for their child when he/she gets home. And even in surprise form of a present for doing good in school, students will be very happy that their parents did this for them and will do even better knowing the fact that if they do good something even better will be waiting for them next time.

Those are the three reasons why

I think that students should be allowed to use phones during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phone is turned off during class. One, incase of emergencies. Two, feeling of freedom. And three, the ability to tell their parents for a present of some sort for doing good in school. So allow the use of cell phones and students will enjoy coming to school and will be happy to do good.
