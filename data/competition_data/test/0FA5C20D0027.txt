Driverless cars are coming thats no good! Since 2009 google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. Thier cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless. The Google cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

In my opion driverless cars are pretty dangerous and stupid. I think that becasue drivers would try to play on their phone more and do other things that will not make them keep their eyes on the road or their surroundings. Just because the cars are "driverless" doesn't mean they cant mess up or have a glitch when they are driving and when they are playing on their phones. Having driverless cars is a huge mistakes they will put peoples life at risk and so many people when end up wrecking and dieing because they are more worried about their mobile devices.

My second reason I think "driverless" cars are stupid is becasue people will not pay attention to their surrounding. People will pay attention to the things that are inside the car and not the things outside the car like other cars around them or even other object around them. People driving the car will be more focoused on the radio or all the cool features that come with the car like the new bluetooth radio or the new settting on the radio. The new cars will have so many new featrues that people will not even realize they are on the road.

My last reason I think the cars are stupid is becasue what are people gonna do when the car breaks or glitches up. The first batch of cars will have issues just like the first batch of everything that is new. The car could glitch up at any moment when the car is in motion and some one is in it. What are people gonna do when they are driving and the car just stops driving itself and runs off the road into oncoming traffic or runs off a mountain. What are the people gonna do when their family memebrs die because of the cars glitching up and killing their brother,sister, or cousin. The first thing they are going to do is blame the company and sue them for everything they have.

That is why I think "driverless" cars are stupid and dangerous. People will not pay attention they will car more about their phone. People will not pay attention to their surrounding they will pay attention to things inside the car. And the cars have a high chance of glitching up and killing the driver or maybe another person in the street or on the sidewalk. That is why I think they are very dumb and dangerous.
