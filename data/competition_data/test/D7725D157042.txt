For technology to be able to read the emotional expressions of students would be very beneficial . Some students could struggle with verbally expressing their emotion's making it hard for their teacher/learning coach to know the most successful way to teach them. Therefore if the student starts to get bored, anxious, or confused the computer could pick up on those emotions and make changes to the student's learning lesson to help get them back to focus and engage with their learning . ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, "Dr. Huang predicts. ''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. ''

Mental illness is on a rise amongst people in general, Students suffer from it too they're not indestructable or working machinces.

Technology being able to read emotional expressions of students is very valuable it could help students to feel less stressed when working on a lesson they struggle with , without the panicky feeling of having to talk to the teacher about it infront of the class which could cause anxiety . With a majority of communication being nonverbal it can be hard to understand even for humans , technology being able to pick up on it would be alot easier and not feel as intrusive as the student having to explain themselve to the teacher/learning coach. ''Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,'' notes Dr. Huang. ''So computers need to understand that, too''.
