Venus, it the second planet in the solar system and the closet one to Earth which scientist also calls Venus twin and since Venus is a sister planet to Earth scientist must study the plant but Venus has alot of dangers but Scientist are fascinated by Venus even if its has danger in it present.

"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes fimilar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." Therefor this is a reason why scientist love to study Venus it just like Earth but without any humans on the planet and it could be an option for a next planet vist.

"Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendy ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivabe for humans." So since Venus is like kind of sutable for humans it could be a new Earth in cse if something happen on Earth like a radioactive wave that could kill anybody we can go to Venus and live there dispite the harsh temepature and landing, it has a lot of similaritys of Earth.

Overall Venus is a good planet for living things to live on and good thing for scientist to study over Venus to get some good and bad and theres obaviously bad side of Venus but scientist and many other researchers are trying there best to make a perfect world incase somethng does hapen in the future and we have to evacuate Earth.
