Dear Mrs/Mr.{insert principle's name here},

I am aware you are thinking about considering a new phone policy, and you are having a hard time wondering which road to take .Well I believe you should not allow students to use phones at school at all .My reason to believe this is because though students might be here to learn ,they don't always do .

Lets say a student calls a certain person during lunch and they talk about school ,family , after school , all the fun and social stuff .But then the receiver mentions something important or crucial the student does not know about ,and things get ugly in a hurry .The student then goes to class but is to distracted by the earlier conversation to learn .If she/he had not called during school but after ,maybe she/he could have concentrated in class and actually learned a thing or two .This is just one scenario ,there could be hundreds of other possibilities this policy could go wrong that could make an entire day of reading ,writing and learning go to waste .If that isn't bad enough ,some student already have something on their mind before even coming to school .

Please don't let anything get in the way of learning at this school ,our educations could mean so much to the future ,even if we don't like it .Either its in the field of science ,art ,literature ,or even something completely different, knowledge is the key to the advancement of humanity ,and our lega.
