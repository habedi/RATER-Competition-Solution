My opinion on using cell phones at school is positive. I think that phones should at school because it is needed for kids to call their parents to pick them up after school. Another reason is because what if one day a student finds somebody that needs help and need to call the ambulance. That student could save that persons life I say that for experience. Also in any type of emergencies like when your guardian or your friend, neighbor etc drop you of and forget something they could just call you so the guardian doesn't have to stop where their going and go all the way to the office to give them your stuff. Also the students would to check on their family when somebody is sick.

Another reason is if the principal is nice and cool enough to let us use our phones during free time. We will consider the kind ness to us and respect the knew rules. It would get us closer to the teachers and all staff. We would be like having the coolest school ever. If we are allowed to use our phones at school we would consider the principal understanding that we want to entertain ourselves when we are having free time somehow.
