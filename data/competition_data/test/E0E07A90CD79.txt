School Activities

Participating in extracurricular activities at school is very enjoyable and gives people something to do. There is a wide variety of activities that are available to participate in at school like playing sports, working on the yearbook, and being apart of the student council. Although many choices are available, that does not mean everyone is required to be apart of a club or organization at school. It should not be mandatory to do school activities because people may do other activities outside of school, not be interested in taking part in school activities, or have no time and money to be apart of a school group. An important part of being a student and a teenager is making their own decisions by picking what they like and don't like. Middle School and High School students are more independent and responsible, so they make their own choices on what activities to partake in.

Firstly, a majority of students participate in other activities outside of school. Sports are the most common things for students to do in their free time. Playing school sports should not be mandatory because students who play travel sports or any type of sport outside of school already have to deal with complicated schedules and practice times. It's not just sports that take up so much time though; students have to do homework, study, make time to hang out with friends, and have hobbies that they find fun and relaxing. If students do activities outside of school like playing sports or writing stories, they might not care to play sports or be in a writing club for the school because they already do those things outside of school on their own time.

Secondly, some students do not want to do any activities. Not everyone has to do something if they don't want to, because participating in educational activities at school is something that should be optional and not required for all students. Playing sports, working on the yearbook, or being apart of a student council does not appeal to every single student at a High School or Middle School. Even if a student is interested in art and painting, that particular individual does not have to be in an Art Club at school unless they choose to be. It is always good to have an average amount of members in each club so all clubs are equal and can represent the school by the activities they take part in. But, by creating a rule that students have to be in at least one club, students may join random clubs just to abide by the rules, even though they show no particular passion or liking of their club of choice. When this happens, nobody will actually care for the activity they chose because they would've been forced to be apart of it, which takes away the fun.

Lastly,

Students may not have enough time or money to be involved in school sports, yearbook club, or a student council. Activities like sports or organized clubs can have practices, games, or meetings daily. More Specifically, sports gear costs a large amount of money and needs to be replaced once in a while. Transportation could also be an issue for getting to and from the school or places that students hold games or meetings. If a student tries to balance a school activity, something outside of school, and homework, they could become stressed and not perform as well in those three activities. Overall, the decision of whether or not a student participates in extracurricular activities should be decided by each individual student themselves, because everyone is different and knows how many activities they can handle at a time.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principals' decision to force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity on school grounds. The principal should just highly encourage students to participate in things like sports, clubs, and organizations instead of creating a rule about them. A lot of different kinds of people go to school,and not everybody shares a common interest. Whether it be Middle School or High School, there is not going to be a club or extra curricular activity for everyone to be themselves and thrive with their peers. It should not be mandatory for students to be apart of extracurricular activities at school because of students having hobbies outside of school, not be interested in doing these activities, or they have don't have time and money to join a school group. So, instead of forcing all students at school to be involved, create more options for all different types of people to join. This whole problem can be solved by posting fliers or making announcements about upcoming events or new clubs.
