Sure driving your car is the fastest and most convenient way to reach your desired destination. But is it the most friendly to the environment? The answer is no. Decreasing the amount of vehicles permitted on publis streets would greatly help reduce this issue. Driving an automobile is very harmful for Earth. Many countries have been trying to decrease the amount of vehicles on the streets.

In Vauban, Germany, the residents have almost completely given up driving. Home garages, street parking, and driveways are forbidden here. The roads are completely car free except for public transportation. Car ownership is allowed, with the consequence of paying $40,000 for a spot to park, along with a house. Vauban's ideas are being adopted around the world.

Over in Paris, partial driving bans have been enforced to help prevent the build up of smog. Every Monday drivers with even-numbered license plates are not permitted to drive. The same rules applied to people who drove vehicles with odd-numbered license plates on Tuesday. If they failed to follow their orders they will be fined with with a 22-euro, or $31, fine. About 4,000 motorists were fined and a recorded 27 had their vehicles impounded because of their ractions to the fines. Because of the warm days and cold nights, car emissions were trapped under the warmer layer of air. Enough smog cleared on Monday so they dropped the Ban for Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia had a program which involved millions of Columbians skating, hiking, biking, etc. This was during a "car-free day" where only public transportaion was allowed. Their goal is to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. Any violators were fined $25. Other Columbian cities such as Cali and Valledupar eventually joined the event. Since then, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed.

There are many ways to reduce the amount of gases released into the atmosphere. Limiting the amount of automobiles permitted on the streets is one of the biggest ways to solve this issue. If everyone would join in on these events we could restore what we have taken away from the environment.
