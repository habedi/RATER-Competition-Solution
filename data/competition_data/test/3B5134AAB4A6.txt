If people look at images of Cydonia Mars, they will come to see what looks like a mysterious face. A plethora amount of people belive that this face was made by aliens. Aliens are not real, and if they where we would have come to account with them by this day in age. It is humorous to think that people belive in aliens. These claims are rediculous to even think about if you have common sence.

The mysterious face on Mars is just a mesa. It is just something that came to be like how the Grand Canyon was formed. As the cameras get better pictures, the face starts to disappear. The picture was took in 1976 when technology was just now new to us. The conspiracy theory is not true.

People claim that then new picture of the face is not a valid source because it was "cloudy." These claims are rediculous. We went up into space again to find that it still looked nothing like a face. If this was created by aliens, then that means the pyramids were created by aliens, or Niagara Falls was created by aliens. It is the same as saying the universe was created by aliens.

The face is just a natural landform just like any natural landform on Earth. If the face was supposidly created by aliens then you could also say that about any natural landform on Earth. In fact, the new pictures of the face look nothing like a face.

People who believe these theories must have a huge imagination. If these aliens are real, how come we havent come to account with them yet. Many people believe that the face was made by aliens. The mysterious face on Mars is was not created by aliens.
