"Teenager girl gets into a deadly car accident due to her self-driving car shutting down." This is one of the main reasons why i am 100% against Driverless cars. Yes, having a self-driven car could be fun, and could help out some people. But for others having a car that is supposed to drive itself could be not only boring and tiring. But for me I would say that it would be dreadful, and dangerous.

Having a self-driven car is a terrible idea to me. I say that because what if you are driving, and then something unexpected happens on the road that the car is unaware of and the car stopps working? I dont know about you, but that is one of my biggest fears. I would hate to have a car and not know what could happen or what the car is capable of doing. Some may say that its a self-diven car, so it would never do that, and that not knowing what are car is capable of doing is good. But to me that is not good at all, i hate not knowing everything there is to know about my car. Thats not only scary, but its stressful too. It builds up stress and it makes you feel like to have to be worried everytime you get into your car.

Another reason why i say people should never get a self-driven car is that it would be tiring. Like your in a car all day, but your not driving it. Your litterally just sitting in a car waiting for something to happen so you could take over. When im in a car sitting in the passengers seat i get tired a lot and i ofthen fall asleep. Now could you imagine be in the drivers seat of a car, rolling down the street, not doing anything but looking out the window hoping something would happen and you could finally take over and start to drive. Just reading that sounds tiring, i would most defineatley fall asleep and then something would happen and then i would really be in trouble.

My last reason why i feel no one should ever get a self-driven car is because no one wants to have a car that they cant drive. And i feel that that is exactly what you are getting when you are dealing with a self-driven car. i feel that you basically wated your hard earned money on a car that you have to wait to drive. I say that because in the passage it clearly states that when you are in a driverless car all you have to do is look out for the car, and then when something seem to be wrong you take over. Thats no fun to me and it would honestly make me mad.

having a driverless car is like having a sick baby. You never know when its going to just stop working. And you will never know whats wrong with it because it cant talk to you and it will never respond.
