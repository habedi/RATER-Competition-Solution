Dear Obviously Desperate For Help Principal,

There are many students with cell phones in school. They text in class, in the hallways, and at lunch. They're not allowed to text, yet they do. It's a way of communication in school, that cannot be stifled by teachers, as the teachers cannot hear their conversation. I myself do not have a cell phone, but many of my friends do. They set up meetings, tell their parents when to pick them up, and help each other with their homework through their phones. The current policy states that students may not be seen with a cell phone any time of the day at school. However, at the high school, students can use their phones in between classes, and at lunch. I believe that this policy is the better one.

In between classes, the child might not even be in school. Their use of cell phones doesn't interrupt class, it doesn't make a lot of noise, and it doesn't make anyone look stupid. It's a quiet way for students across the building from one another to communicate. At the high school, students may text in between classes. This gives them a time when they can communicate with friends and parents without directly talking to the person in question. The temptation of texting during class would go un-satiated if the students weren't able to use the phones in the halls. It would become too great for them, and they would text during class. However, if students were able to text in the halls, they could carry on conversations throughout the day, without interrupting the learning process.

Using cell phones is a way to communicate. Most students have a cell phone, and are able to arrange things through it. It's an important way for children to talk to other people who may or may not be in the immediate vicinity. It's quieter than talking, and less disrupting than passing notes. Students need to be able to communicate in an un-stifled way. Cell phones are the way to do that.
