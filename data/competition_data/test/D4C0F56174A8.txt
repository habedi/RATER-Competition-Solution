The electoral collage is horable because the bigger states has more power then the smaler states do so if a canidate gets the majority of the bigger states then they will but people in the may not whant that candidate but the electors for that canidate didn't get selected then he will not get the electoral vote from your state even when more people in your state wanted him to win but his electors didn't get selected.

SomeÂ  states vote republican or democrate un like swing stats so if you are in a state that is a democrate state but you want a republican then your vote dosn't matter because it is not a swing state. If more people like a canidate then he should win the election becouse the people want him to be president but he can't because of the electoral college and now those people would be unhappy because their vote dosn't matter the electoral college voting system is long and coplex but if you change it to popular vote the it will be easer to select a canidate for president. people want to get the electoral college changed to popular vote and if the majority want to change it then you should chan the voteing sytem to how the people want it to be like.
