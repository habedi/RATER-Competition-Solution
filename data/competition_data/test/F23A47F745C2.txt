Do you think students will benefit from attending classes at home? I as a public school student think that students will most definetly benefit from taking online classes and video conferencing attending school from home. Attending school from home have various benifits like financial situations for parents or gaurdians, time, and decrease on truancy or attendence failure.

First, financial situations for parents could be very helpful to the house hold. Situations like school dues, extra curiculum costs, or even some thing simple like school clothes can make a whole diffrent on your or you parents wallet. The money you use for buying school clothes and shoes can be saved for a college tuition or go towards a house or liability bill. When it comes to adding up the money you've spent through the school year on public school atire or supplies, it comes up to be a big portion of money out of your checkings. Attending school at home, in my eyes i think its a great financial benefit.

Next, time is one of the most important things in every day life dealing with work, school, or even free time.

I feel time is one more good benefit from attending classes at home. It have been many situations where I have seen students having to drop out of school because he / she do not have enough time to balence school and employment. Some teens give birth while in school, but cant pass the class because they cant make it to school dealing with a doctors appointment or have to watch there kid while the parent work. It seems hard to work, go to school, and take care of a baby at the same time, but if classes where taken at home then it would be easier to watch the baby and maybe do a little bit of school work at a time.

Last, attendence failure and truancy can be avoided by attending classes from home. You wouldnt have to miss days of school when you have the work and video conferencing in your own home. Being tardy to classes would be less of a problem because there wouldnt be any class to go to , expecially if the class in your own home. Some students can not make it to school because of injuries or other personal problems, but it still counts as an absent in the system. In most schools a certain amount of abesences can fail you or make it so you cant miss any days at all or your gaurdian goes to court. That is another benefit i believe students would have if taking classes from home.

Inconclusion, I still believe students have benefits by home schooling, because It saves time for important reasons. Taking online classes and video conferencing at home also helps with your financial reasons. Another benifit is, it cuts down down on attendence failure and truancy. Sometime people cant help missing school or coming to school late. But my opinion on attending classes from home is it is a great idea because it is many healthy and helpful benefits some people may need.
