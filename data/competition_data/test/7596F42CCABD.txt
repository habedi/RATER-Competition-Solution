Scientist at NASA do their best to figure the right information they have about the " Unmasking the Face on Mars "

. It was actually a better idea to keep the " Face on Mars " a secret just between the NASA team , then if nothing was bad news it could have been told after getting all the right information . The possiblities on knowing what this is and letting everyone know was very hard . It's been there since 1976 and in 2001 , at last some resoltes on the Face on Mars . NASA is very important , and if they know that it's better not to tell anyone about this , I think the people should respect their decison because they found it . Most importantly not letting people make a big deal out of this because they don't know what it could be yet .

Sometime we can't say somethings at the most part , Because it's better not to let anyone know before people go crazy and go around asking a bunch of questions . The Face on Mars was discovered in 1976 , and by the time that has passed , it's easier to see how it actually looks . But of cource you can't just send someone out to space and actually see what's going on . It's not that easy to just do that . There could be some species that are out there somewhere and don't even know about it . A period of time we believed it might have been a alien artifact , but it doesn't look like an alien's face which is something we could be for sure about that . Seeing the picture that the ( MOC ) team revealing the photo of the face , people weren't so satisfied as they thought . The people must be thinking , " There's something up in space , should we be clam or should it be best to be worried ? " , that's what might have happens when people don't listen to what we say is best and do what they think is right .

But at the end of all this story and " Oh it''s this " or " No , wait it's actually that

" , it turns out that it is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or of the mesa . It's a common landforms around American West and it's the lava dome that formed an isolated mesa . Which is the same height as the " Face on mars " . Everything is perfectly fine , and everyone can be clam since we found out the actual and correct information and not just some random anwers that people were going around and saying about this .
