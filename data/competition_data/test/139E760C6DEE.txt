Dear Principal,

I don't think you should change the school policy so students have to have a least a grade B average. I think this because a lot of kids who do sports might have a C and not a B. Also kids who don't have a grade B average might just drop out of the sport and not fix there grade and then they wont get any exercise. Exercise is very important so kids can stay healthy and live a healthy life. So as you can see sports are very important to kids and also sports keep kids in shape and motivative and it shows them how to work as a team. Although grades are important so are kids health. Another reason why you should change the school policy because if you take out all the kids with a grade C point average then there wont be as many people playing sports or in other school activities.

sincerely, 8th Grade student
