The author supports his idea of how the knowledge of Venus and how it can contribute innovations that would allow their machines that they us to last long enough and the dangers of that is that it can be striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself due to human curiosity it will likely lead us into many equally endeavors.

And my evidence that supports my claim is that the NASA is been working and studying on approaches of Venus, one of the examples that they have found is some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos on Venus's surface. Venus still features such as valleys, mountains, and craters to recall Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

My introduction is about Venus is that the value of the indisputable of it is where the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive. My body that Venus is the same as Earth since their twins since their close to each other in terms of density and size and Venus even orbits the sun at different speeds. And my conclusion is Venus has a atomosphere at almost 100 percent of carbon dioxide and more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid on Venus that makes the hottest surface temp of any kind of planet in the solar system in outer space.
