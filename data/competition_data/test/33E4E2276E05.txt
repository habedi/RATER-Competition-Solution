The electoral college process consist of the selection of the elector, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president in a way to let us the people choose to keep our country safe and to help our community. So therefore i think we should keep the electoral college.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. Also we help choose our states electors when we vote for president, but if we did'nt have an electoral college there would'nt be any reason to have a president or government.

But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (

and that trust is rarely betrayed

), what they mean by that is that if he or she were to become president they could not lie or betray anyone.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast. I think they should really make people vote because its not fair or equal if only half of us americans voted.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates as we saw in [

2012's

] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. which means almost everyone voted that year.

The electoral college method helps see who the right person is to help our country. Therefore they need to keep the electoral college for us to see where it will take us all through the years and for us to acknowledge how it has helped americans all around the world to get where they are today.
