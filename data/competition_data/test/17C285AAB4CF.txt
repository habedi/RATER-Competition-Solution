How Can We Explore Venus?

Today many scientists are looking on how to get to Venus and study it, researchers have been trying to find a way but had always failed. Now they're still looking on what to do because the planet Venus is really facinating and amazing for them.

Why does until today scientists keep wanting to visiting Earth's twin (Venus)? Because the planet itself is incredible. And it says it in the text in paragraph 4 that "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in ouir solar system." The studies that they researchers have made so far is that " Long ago, the planet Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Based on the text we can see that the next planet's fascinating, according to the passage it is really hard to get just one foot on Venus, you won't even last a minute or more, we can see it's impossible to land on it. But that doesn't affect scientists. The writer said that "It's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets..., and the temperatures average are over 800 degrees Farhenheit, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." But it does not matter to them.

In the fourth paragraph the writer state that the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and " It includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Recall that Venus can sometims be our nearest option for a planetary visit." The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable for scientists,"but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?" That's the questions they're asking themselves until today.

NASA have been testing some electronics made of silicon carbide at higher temperature in a chamber, the same as Venus's, and it lasted for three weeks in those conditions, they're still believing in landing on Venus, because "human curiosity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." said the author.
