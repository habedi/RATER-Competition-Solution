Some schools offer classes at home with online and video conferencing, Students would benefit from home schooling because some students are uneasy around other students, Some students do better when doing things on their time, And some students would do more work than when they are at school.

Reason one home schools is beneficial is some students are uneasy when around other students. For example, I was bullied a lot last year to the point i was to scared to come to school. When I would come to school i would think about what's going to happen today. I was so scared that when I started home school I was scared of that to, but once you start home school it helps out a lot. I know home school helped me out.

The secured reason that home schooling is beneficial is that some students do better on there own time. When students are rushed they won't be about to do all the work that they need to do. For example, There is a huge project that all seniors have to do at my school that is due next week, I was going to make a movie for the project but by being rusted and not having my own time to do it and get it done I wont be able to make the movie and have it in on time. In home school the students can do all the work and much more to show what they are made of.

The third reason why home schooling is beneficial is that students will do all there work and more. At school students are distracted by there friends, teachers, and every noise that goes buy the class room doors. When at home students can do there work where they know they wont get off track. For example, when at home students can be in their rooms and they dont have to worry about their friends talking to them, the noises, and their teachers going off on them.

Some people would argue that home schools isn't beneficial because students will just lay around all day, they wont do there work at all,and they would just be getting a free pass. That is not the truth at all some students need to have home schooling.

In conclusion home schooling would be beneficial for students who are uneasy around other, need there own time to do their work, and they can do more work than what they do already. Home schooling helped me, Why not let it help someone else.
