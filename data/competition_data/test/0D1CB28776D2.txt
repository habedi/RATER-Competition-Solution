CELL PHONE POLICY!

Very few people can deny that we will in a Cyber World. Everything today is pretty much technology. You can't go anywhere without seeing people on their cell phone whether its calling, texting, or on the web. I go out to dinner with my family a lot and there is always people in the restaurant on there phones. In my opinion people are addicted to using technology. I know very few people that don't have cell phones, it's extremely rare for someone to not have a cell phone today.

Cell phone use is excepted in many places, almost everywhere except school. A lot of kids use their cell phones in school whether its aloud or not. I saw cell phone use a lot when I was in 7th grade more than I do this year. There is so much kids can do on a cell phone these days it's hard not to have them with you all the time.

I personally think cell phones should be aloud in school. What's the harm of texting during lunch or during or a study hall? I don't see any harm. I think if we had phones aloud in school the detention rate would go down because people wouldn't be "illegally" using there cell phones during the school day. Having your cell phone with you could be a very good thing for example, what if there was an emergency at home and your parents couldn't reach you. If there was an early release at school we could easily contact our parents at home or work to let them know we are getting out with school early.

With cell phones in school comes big responsibility's for students, they would have to resist texting during class when it wasn't aloud. A good plan would be in classes that texting isn't aloud the phone would have to be silent on there desk where the teacher could see it.

Cell phones these days are very advanced and could benefit kids greatly. They could look information up if teachers aloud, on their phones. If some kids misused their phones in school teachers could just revoke privileges. Schools could make it so if students got in any kind of trouble all cell phone privileges would be provoked for a period of time.

With having cell phones in school comes a few minor problems. Would kids without phones be less benefited? Would kids text each other test answers before a class?

I think cell phones in schools would be a good thing in my opinion. It could reduce money for schools because we wouldn't be using textbooks as much because we could look up information up on our phones without going to a computer. If we didn't use textbooks as much they wouldn't get damaged as often so the schools wouldn't have to buy then all that often. Schools all around the world should seriously think about cell phone use in school!
