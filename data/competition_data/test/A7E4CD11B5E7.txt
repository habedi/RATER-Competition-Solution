Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that students should be required to do community service. I think it would be good if we help the community out like helping elementary students or cleaning up litter. Some students have nothing to do and just sit around and watch television all day. What could be better than to help your community out ? After school some students don't even go home and just go to there friends house and do nothing .Doing community service will keep you entertained. As a matter a fact it will also keep you out of trouble .We need cleaner parks. If community service is required we could go to the park and clean it up and it will be much cleaner and saver to be in and play in. If we help the elementary students and tutor them they will do better in school and actually turn in there homework and who know maybe because of our help they mite end up doing better in there CST .Doing community service wont take as much time. It will all depend on you .If you just want to do one hour or two. It will be up to you .Doing community service will help you out in life and you will all ready be experienced for any future job that you mite want or have. That's why I think that community service should be required.
