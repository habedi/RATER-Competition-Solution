Schools that offer distance lerning for students to get work done from home are far more helpful than schools that do not yet offer this as an option. When a student misses school they come back the next day with a pile of makeup work, that most of the time, will not get done. Not only that, but students end up getting behind in the material that they are learning, and teachers get overwhelmed trying to help them get caught back up. With the option of distance learning, students and teachers could work together and both benefit greatly by being able to work from home using resources such as video confrences and/or online classes.

When a student becomes ill or has to miss school because of other reasons such as doctors appointments, they will have missed everything that their peers learned that day in class, causing them to get behind in their studies. With online classes and video confrences with their teachers not only will they stay up to date with the material that the class is learning but they would get one-on-one time with the teacher. With distance learning students and teachers would not have to stress out about makeup work and re-learning the material.

Not only would this greatly benefit the student, but the teacher as well. If a teacher was able to have a video conference with an absent student, the teacher would not have to worry about that student getting behind. It would make the job of the teacher significantly easier. With online classes and video calls the teacher could therefore cutback on getting together all the grueling makeup work and not have to worry about their student getting behind. Instead all they would have to do is find a time that works during the day to have a video conference and explain the material face-to-face with their student.

All in all, having distance learning as an option in school would be extremely beneficial to both the students and the teachers. The students can stay up to date with the material in class and dont have to worry about a large pile of mkeup work waiting for them the next day, while the teachers do not have to stress about their students being behind. Online classes and teacher video conferences are an exceptional way to help everyone recieve an education.
