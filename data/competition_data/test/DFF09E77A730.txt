Dear Principal,

I think you should let students use there cell phones during any free time they have. I mean, it wouldn't distract them from any work. Having them use there cell phones out of class is an ok thing to do. If its lunch time and there is a student texting to one of his friends, why should they get in trouble? It wouldn't distract them from anything but eating there lunch. During the end of the day when there is still 10 minutes of class left and the teacher says that there is no work to do, just have fun, I think that students should be able to have there cell phones out. There is no work to be done and other kids are having fun talking loudly but a kid is texting- quietly - at there desk and he/she is the one getting in trouble. That's not right. Kids at school should be able to use there cell phone at any time, as long as its not in class. There are so many other reasons that a kid could have there cell phone out during free time. All you have to do is ask them and they will now.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
