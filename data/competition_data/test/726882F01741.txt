The idea of automated driverless cars seems like an invention from a utopian future, but it csuses many potential problems when humans are involved. The question of how to punish a robot arises with the invention of this technology, as well as what the affect on humans would be of having everything done for you by robots. Although this idea is promising and could still be used. Automative transport is quite the visionary idea despite its falacies.

The introduction of driverless cars would warrant the creation of new rules of the road, but that raises the question of whether the passenger or the robot recieves punishment. Also, how would one punish a robot for breaking the law? They are not human so any punishment would be unaffective. Also based on the imformatiom given in paragraph 7, humans might be required to remain partially in control, and if the cars are partial human controlled, how would we guarrentee that the person arrested was actually the offender? The robot could have framed the human.

Another negative side-effect of driverless cars would be that humans could become too lazy and unalert. The human is not required to be alert to the situation of the road, so humans might lose the ability of knowing how to drive. There is also an increasing dependance on machinery to do our jobs for us, and machines are known to not be as capable as a human if there is a problem. Also, if a robot malfunctions while a human is in the car, there would be the question of how the human would handle that situation.

Although, to remain positive about the idea, there are several alternatives that alleviate these potential catastrophies. The idea could still be utilized via public transport. Based on the large amount of sensors that are required for the vehicles to work, ass outlined in paragraph 3 and 4, areas that have little interference would be ideal for these automated cars. Subways run underground where there is an asbsence of human activity, this would be a perfect enviornment for automated transport to be implemented. Another place that is devoid of human interferrence is the ocean. There could be automated cruiseliners that can transport people across water, where there is a lack of traffic problems.

In conclusion, the idea for automated cars is a potentially dangerous and complex, but the idea should not be thrown out. The problems with false accusations and how to punish an automated car arise; as well as the fact that humans could become lazy and unalert in their enviornment. These problems could potentially be solved by changing the venue of where automated transportation is utilized.
