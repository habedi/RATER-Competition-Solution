To the Principal,

I think that the new policy you want is terrible. A "C" grade is average! The policy should be to maintain a "C." For many students, extra-curricular activities are great for their grades. They are for me. If i don't play a sport, I will go crazy. It provides a much needed break from studies, and it is better for health. You need to ditch this new policy.

It could be disastrous for your students. Take it from me, a current student. I have seen the fallout of many friends from policies like this. I know what it's like. So I think that you need to get out before something bad happens.

A "C" grade is average. The average kids can still do well. If they have a "D", then yes, I agree, they shouldn't be playing sports. However, a "C" is still an average grade. Those kids need a chance to be great. Who knows? Maybe they will end up doing something great all because they were able to play sports this one year in school. Haven't there been so many average people that have done wonderful things for our world, and haven't there been so many "average" people that have excelled in sports? They deserve the chance as an American to at least try out for sports. Now, don't get me wrong. A "B" is an excellent thing to achieve, and they would have motivation, but some kids just can't reach a "B," and those are the kids who will not benefit from this policy.

Sports are huge for me in my everyday life. It is a great break from studies, and a much needed one too. We have lots of homework, and if we sit down and do it all in one time, we won't retain it. That's called cramming. Breaks are great for the mind, and for a student's grades. So, if students are going to take a break, let them do it with sports instead of sitting down and wasting their time with mindless video games. Exams are another important time for breaks. Many people try to cram. They go home and study for hours on end. That is terrible for them. And, if they were on a sports team, they would get a break because it is not acceptable to miss practice because of exams.

As we all know, health is a huge issue in America. If those kids that just can't seem to get and maintain a "B," no matter what they do, aren't allowed to play sports, they will use their time for other things. Video games, parties, food, alcohol, drugs, sex. Those are just a few of the things that kids with too much time do. They are all for pleasure. They are terrible for health, and can even lead to death. You don't want any of your students to die, do you? I know that you are a sensible person, and you would never want to feel the guilt of a students death.

Overall, the "average" kids need a chance. Every principal wants healthy kids, and good grades. Well, sports use up time. Kids with too much time are the ones that get into the wrong things, or the wrong study habits. They could study very little for 6 hours instead of studying very diligently for 1 hour. They retain more from the one hour than the distracted 6 hours. Michael Jordan was average. He was cut from a sports team in high school. And look what he did. He changed the modern-day world forever. And who knows, one of your "average" students could one day do the same thing.

Thank you for looking at my letter, and I hope my views help you review your new policy.

Sincerely,
