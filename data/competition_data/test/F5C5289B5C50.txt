Students are stressed and tired from all of the pressure and work they are given from school. Most students look towards their six-week break in the end of the school year. Students plan trips with friends, or takes a vacation, and some even get a job. They are expected to be at school by 8:10 am, and are dismissed by 2:55 pm. That is eight hours at school, five times a week. When arriving home, students often are start on the homework were given. After school activities, such a sports or art, also take time from students as well. As a student myself, I don't want a summer project, teacher-designed or student-designed. I think that it is important for students to get the six week summer break that they rightly deserve, with no more stress.

Firstly, some students use their time during summer break to be spend time with their family and hang out with friends. Students are stressed from the school work never have the to sit back and relax. As a student myself, I never get to spend time with family or friends since all of my time is consumed by school. During the school year, I am always I am usually stressed and tired, from all of the AP classes that I am taking and the after school soccer practices. By the time I get home, its late and have to start on each of the homework pile that my teachers gave me, and study for the tests that i have the following day. When I am done with all the work, Its late at night and I go to sleep without being able to talk with those around me. I always looking forward for summer break, because I know I am going be stress free and have fun. It is the only time for me to sit back, relax and spend time with family, and socialize with my friends.

Next, students are going on vacation out of town, out of the country or some even stay and pick up a job. When out on a vacation, they are not given the time, or resources to work on summer projects. I have friends who usually go on trips to third world countries that don't have the necessities for them to work on a summer projects. They also don't have time to work on it either since they are helping the people in the camps they visit. It would be outrageous to expect them to work on summer projects. I also know some students who get pick up job over the summer to save up some money for college. They are working all day and sometimes at night and are too busy to work on a summer projects as well. Some may say that students must find a way to find time to work in their six-week break, or else they will forget the things they were being taught over the year. But teachers are always finding themselves reteaching what they taught just before a regular two-day weekend.

Students deserve to have a summer without having to a workload on them and just have a summer where they can sit back, have fun, be with friends and family. it wouldn't be a good idea to have summer projects, teacher designed, or student designed. It will just be a hassle for the students, and some wont even be able to get them done since they are doing things over the summer. Schools should not enforce summer projects onto students when it would just put them into a disadvantage.
