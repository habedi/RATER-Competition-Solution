Our principle decided that every student should participate in extracurricular activity. Do you agree or disagree? Well I agree on this because,first it gives them a chance to be something. Also,they can find what they are good at.

My first reason why I agree on this is because,it gives them a chance to be something life. Some kids may not have talents or a certain gifts. so when they do these activities, they start to get at them. Then they go and bring it to the real world and make a living off of learning a skill. Which means you don't have to be physically active or outstandingly smart to do these activities.

Also, another reason is because, they would be able to find what they are good at. There was this one time when all I knew was music. Then one year something told me to try something new. So I tried football and basketball which are both extracurricular activities. I played them and then I found out i was actually good at sports. In which this means go try something new and you'll be surprised.

In conclusion,I do agree that kids should listen to our principle and do the activities. For multiple reasons such as mine. Which are because it gives them a chance to be something and also they can find what they are good at.
