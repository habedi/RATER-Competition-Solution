community service?

no way

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with your decision. I think students should not be allowed to do community service because it takes too much time away from us. We get a lot of homework everyday, which takes half of our time away, and almost every week we have two or three tests. We have to study, do homework, and do house chores, which takes the whole time away from us, and now you want us to do community service! We wont have any time to play and we will have to work all the time. I know that community service will benefit us in the future like in high-school, and I also know that studying is important, but not all the time. If we don't play we will look like school zombies, that always studies. That basically wont be considered life, and what life of a child is. I know and I can understand that community service is very important, but children have a busy life. Students always have to focus on studying, and reach up to their parents hope. For example, my parents want me to get 98 or 99% average, and I study day and night to make my parents proud of me, and i actually do get that high percentages, but if i start doing community service my grades will drop because i wont have enough time to study. Community service and studying is not amusing, but they both benefit us. There are many things that are expected from kids, like community service, but the problem is the amount of pressure these days on a student to A' s that test. If we don't get that much homework and tests, then i am ready to do community service. I really hope you can understand our problems, that we don't have a problem performing community service, even if we have to tutor elementary school children or clean up litter. The main problem is the pressure of getting good grades. Sorry, if your disappointed.

Sincerely, one of your best student
