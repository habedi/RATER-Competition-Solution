well i will argue against it because i bet some of the teachers and Cs when they went to middle school and how they still got to participate in sports and how C is average and that some teachers where at Cs but now she want to change that to be so now the school will lose more money because there's probably more C sport players then threes A and B grade sport players and what u pay like 300 dollars just to join the football team and it's not fair to the lower grade but there really good at sports and some people with Bs aren't so good at sports so then there's going to be kids that aren't the brightest at school but they would not be treating them equal to the kids with Bs and As. and then the kids for example when they play football which was like every day they stayed after they parents would get home before they did so that way the kids don't have to stay home alone. and when there's kids that are Bs and As they may not be as built for there position and the Cs people are so then the team wouldn't be as good and then it a smart A or B student get hammered really hard in football he could get like head trauma and brain damage so then his grades would suffer because of it and i bet the school loves the trophies that are in the class case out there in the hall what and if you look at the pictures and you look at the teams there kids that have all different grades not just A and B grades and i bet with all the C and below students there wouldn't be as many trophies winning in the coming years because the 7th grade foot ball team last year hade C students and look they won district champs. but then again it they do beside to put that policy in affect students who love sports will maybe try to get there grade up so they can play or they wont and just let it drop because they cant play and some times that's all kids do is just play sports and there about to take it away. which they should not do because it's not fair to all students.
