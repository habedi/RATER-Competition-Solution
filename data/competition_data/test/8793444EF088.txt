Millions of people attend school everyday all around the World. Many of these people attend classes at public schools rather than taking classes online because people feel as though classes at public school are a better option and are more beneficial. However, online classes provide the same learning curriculum and information as public schools do. The only major difference between the two class options are that online cclasses allow people to take classes from home. Taking classes from home allows for students to experience the benefits of working in a more comfortable setting, increases their ability to focus, and teaches the importance of responsibility.

In order for students to work productively they need to be within a comfortable environment. Online classes allows for students to experience this. For Example, Generic_Name took Biology online from home for his 1st semester and he always turned in his work on time and always finished his work within 30 minutes to an hour, but Generic_Name's shy friend Generic_Name who didn't take the class online and went to school hardly turned in his work on time and was always slacking off. Generic_Name being able to independently work from home in a comfortable setting allowed him to work in a efficient manor. When students are uncomfortable in the environment they can't work productively because they don't feel comfortable. Without being comfortable in situations students constantly get sidetracked and can't get work done because they may feel as though they are being judged or face issues of uncertainty. Another example is Generic_Name took Algebra 2 online from home her Sophomore year in High School and always knew what she was doing and how to solve the mathematical equations properly, however her boyfriend Generic_Name who took the class at school struggled with finishing his work and keeping a good grade in the class. Generic_Name having the ability to do her work in her bed and being comfortable while she did her work allowed for her to complete her work. Without comfort students struggle to process certain criteria because they aren't relaxed and can't comprehend material that is given to them because they will focus on the fat that they are uncomfortable. Students must feel as though they are in a calming environment in order to work efficiently.

Students are only able to truly focus when they aren't distracted by others. Online classes decrease the vast amount of distractions that public schooling classes have. For Instance, Generic_Name has a project in her AP Environmental Science class online that is due in 3 weeks so as soon as she gets the assignment she starts to work on the project, on the other hand Generic_Name's friend Generic_Name who takes the same class in school and received the same project didn't even think to look at the paper because she decided to talk to people in her class instead. Generic_Name doesn't experience the distractions that Generic_Name does because Generic_Name takes the class by herself and doesn't have to deal with multiple people left and right. When students are away from constant distractions they have the ability to truly focus on the task at hand. Another instance is Generic_Name has to read 20 pages everyday for his AP Literature class and always succeeds to do so, yet his friend Generic_Name who takes the book at school and has time to read in class consistently fails to read the assigned work because he is always staring at a girl in his class. With Generic_Name taking the class from home and not having to deal with being distracted by a girl he thinks is pretty all the time allows for him to stay on task and pay attention. Students can easily experience concentration issues when they are surrounded by multiple people rather than just being by themselves because the mind tends to wonder when in a environment of multiple people. In order for students to remain on task they can't be within an environment that distracts them.

When doing a task on one's own terms they learn how to be responsible. Online classes teach students that it is their personal responsibility to complete tasks given to them. One example is Generic_Name had was taking Spanish online from home and his teacher doesn't send out emails of when the assignments need to be completed, but his girlfriend Generic_Name who takes his class at school always gets reminders during class when the assignments are due. Generic_Name has to consistently check for work himself rather than always relying on his teacher to tell him. Generic_Name's online teacher doing this will allow students to learn that they are responsible for knowing what and when assignments are due. Another example is Generic_Name was doing work online from home and was notified once online that in one week before that his exam was coming up and had to study for the test, yet his friend Generic_Name who attended school and took the same class and had the same teacher was informed 3 times during the week before the exam that he had to study before the exam. Without daily meetings with teachers the students have to take the initiative to follow the instructions they are given. If the instructions aren't followed it is on the student that they had not been active online and payed attention when the information was provided.

Overall online classes can be very helpful to students and their learning processes. Online classes allow for students to feel comfortable while learning, pay more attention to information, and realize that they must keep up with assignments given. Students have the ability to feel more comfortable and complete their work when they take classes at home rather than taking classes in school. Online classes can also help decrease the number of issues that may take attention away from the given tasks. These classes also allow for students to learn that they have the duty to keep themselves informed and that they can't rely on others for work. Ultimately online classes are an excellent option for students to take and students should consider the multiple benefits that come with taking classes from home.Â
