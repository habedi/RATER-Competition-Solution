The technology to read the emotional epressions of students is very unecessary. i believe its unecessary because, that would be too much information to be giving a computer. a computure dont need to know students faces & emotions, its used for technology only.

The first reason why i say no because the computer already holds enough information about students like their full name, birthday, location & more. Students feelings & emotions shouldnt go on a computer. In the article, the author mentioned that the computer will study your face muscles too see if you are confused, happy, sad, etc. That would be holding too much information about a child or teen & you never know whats going on or whos waching behind tha computer screen.

Also, Its not a computers business on how a student is feelings. its a computer, not a person. its no llke the computer can do something about their emotions. Thats a teachers job with seeing how a student is feeling, not a compters.

Though it is a good idea to come up with, i will still disagree with this invention/idea. a computer should not have that much info on someone period. also, you never know who may be watching behind the computer screen.
