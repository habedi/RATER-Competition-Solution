In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus the Author seems to have strong feelings about wanting to visit Venus. In the article is says venus has some bad things if you go there. Venus is Earth's twin as it says in the article it's the closest in size, density and distnce too, because venus is right around the corner many people have sent a good amount of spacecraft to land on Venus. None of the Spacecrafts was able to survive. Venus is very hard to get to because spacecrafts didn't make it and neither will people. Venus is 170 degrees they can average over 800 degrees. Venus is a very hot Planet.

The NASA has one particular idea to send humans to study Venus. Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth's level Not easy conditions but the people who go to Venus would be able to survive. The Author seems to know a lot about Venus and how much he wants to be able to know or see more about it.

The Author will more than likely look more into this and see if visiting Venus is possible and if it is he will more than likely go and write more and tell people what he expierenced and what it looked like. The Author talked a lot about Venus and how much he wanted to see what it looks like and if you could survive on it he definitly know what he is talking about and knows a lot of Pro's and Con's about it and will learn more. I agree with the Author I think visiting Venus could be possible if they did some more research about making sure the humans would be okay and safe and be able to go back to earth safe and sound when they can Visiting Venus would be great.
