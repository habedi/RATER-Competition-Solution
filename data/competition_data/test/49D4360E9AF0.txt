Do you think summer school project be teacher-designed or student designed so student could stay learning over their breaks.

I think that summer schools project should be student-designed for better understanding.

Student-designed project will be much easier for student to understand, because they are the one that are going to do the project and will need to use their own ideas and mindset for project that they will understand. Student will have more ideas and better understanding of their projects.

Student-designed project will have more affect to student, they will learn more over breaks and have a developed mindset of creating projects on their own. They will have better understanding and ideas for making unique projects for what they have experienced. Student will more likely turn their projects in with confidence and see what the teacher thinks.

Most student won't turn in their project for two reasons they didn't understand what the teacher was asking for and or they wanted to create their own projects. By letting student-designed projects their will be a higher chance for student to turn them in. This will allow them to use their ideas and mind set run free and in the future they will have better understanding.

By letting student-designed project it will have more affect to student by learning and the understanding of projects. Learning over the breaks students will improve their mindsets and have a better visual on assignments and other work habits.
