"The Challenge of Exploring Venus," is an article written by someone who is arguing that Venus is a worthy exploration, despite the fact that it is highly dangerous. The author's claim was strong, and the points were valid. They included many different supported statements, and facts, and arguments that support their case very well.

Throughout the article, the author gives many different statements that help support their statement that Venus is worth the risk. In paragraph 2, the author discusses all the qualities and characteristics that make Venus an ideal planet to study. Venus is most similar to Earth by means of size and density, and at times, the closest in distance. In paragraph 4, further evidence is put forth. Paragraph 4 discusses the interest scientists have in exploring Venus. It states, " Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." Scientists believe Venus might have once been covered in oceans, which could have easily supported some sort of life. The author included that evidence to show readers that Venus might hold questions many scientists want answers to. The author wants the reader to think more into the exploration of Venus and all of the positive outcomes it could bring us.

The author supported their statements and claims adequatley. For each point the author made, they they gave factual evidence that backed up their point. Each statement was legitamate. For instance, one of the author's points was made in paragraph 5. The author uses an idea from NASA to back up their claim. It states, "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." NASA is working on ways to put explorers on Venus, and the author uses that to help further his claim that Venus should be explored, dangerous or not. The author gives so many points and outside evidence that their claim is more than supported.
