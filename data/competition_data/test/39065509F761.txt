Students these days have their technology, phones, computers, all sorts of stuff. But students should at least have time to do something else and not be stuck with a screen all the time. People should do something else then be in the house all the time, maybe go do something fun, and hang out with friends then texting them through a screen.

Why students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is to have better communication, be distracted away from an electronic, and to have a better health. Having better communication is good to have because then it's easier for you to start conversations with people that you don't really talk to. Another thing is, you will have more friends, building character in yourself makes you more stronger and having to do something more different and do something extra can help with that. Secondly being distracted from electronics is a good thing because then you have more time to do other things, like to go play outside and play soccer or something. Lastly having a better health is good, being inside all day is not good because you can gain lots of weight by just sitting all day and not do anything.

At the end people should do at least one extracurricular activity because to have better communication, be distracted away from electronics, and to have a better health. It will be better for yourself. Don't go and make yourself look horrible, enjoy life to the fullest, it will help a lot to get friends and start conversations with people. It will help you be a better you.Â
