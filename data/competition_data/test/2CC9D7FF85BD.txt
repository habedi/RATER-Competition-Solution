Studying Venus, while that sounds unsafe and a waste of time it's not. Venus has many things similar to Earth, and is speculated to once harbor life just like earth. "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." is an example of this.

Landing on Venus with humans is impossible, because of the amount of gasses and solar radiation along with the extremely hot tempatures. However, NASA is working on an idea to let astronauts survey the planet up close without actually landing on it. NASA has the idea to make a blimp like spacecraft that would fly thirty miles above Venuses ground leaving humans in an area that is barely survivable. "Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system." and " The National Aeronautics and Space Administraition (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus." are both claims from the article.

In conclusion The authors support of the idea studying Venus, while dangerous is worthwile. there are many dangers, but there are also areas for surviveable conditions. Although there is no way for humans to set foot on venus that doesn't mean there is not a way for people to get as close as possible.
