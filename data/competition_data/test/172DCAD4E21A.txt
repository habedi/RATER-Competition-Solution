Every student hate waking up early in the morning for School. Some schools have now offered a distance learning option,Meaning students can take classes online from home. Classes would be taken at home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people might think this is a good idea other's might also not agree with this decision. The idea of taking classes at home is the greatest accomplishment in my opinion.

I agree with the Idea of taking classes online at home. Being able to learn and do assignment at home can be helpful in so many ways,Online classes would benefit students with serious health issues that can't go outside so they're stuck in the house or their room for some years, Online classes would give opportunity to students with a family that decides to go on a vacation during the school year a chance to learn and also keep up with their school work while they're gone. Students might be having issues with the concept of how school classrooms work. Online classes would be a major help for home schooled kids. Some online classes cover subjects or topics that aren't thought at school. Research have made it clear that students who usually sit alone at lunch and others who sit at the back of classrooms with nobody to talk to find it hard to fit it with others around them, so they'd rather just take online classes at home.

Online classes would benefit those with serious health issues that can't go outside so, they're stuck in the house or their room for some years. I think every kids deserve a chance of getting a education no matter what the situation is. Kids with health issues that stays home would have the opportunity to be educated because of online classes. It would give the opportunity for kids with health issues that can't go outside make new friends online while also learning with each other. Online classes would also give students the same amount of education that students that prefer going to school get while they're staying home. Kids with health issues will also have an experience what it's like being at school or in a learning environment but it in a different dimension while they're at home.

Online classes would give students with a family that decades to go on vacation during the school year a chance to learn while they're gone. When students students go away for a vacation they start to fail when assignments aren't turned in. Online classes would give students in that situation a chance to keep up with work while they're on vacation. Online classes would also play a role in learning the same thing as their peers in school are learning. Online classes classes would also be able to educate students while spending time with family. I went on vacation my sophomore year of high school during the middle of the school year. I never got the chance to keep up with work or my grade while I was gone so i ended up having an F being gone for a couple of weeks. If i had the opportunity to take an online class while being gone i would have ended up with a good grade, even though i went on vacation. t turned in.

Research have made it clear that students who usually sit alone at lunch and others who sit at the back of every classroom with nobody to talk to always find it hard to fit in. Online classes would play a major role in their life because they would have the option to be themselves at home where they feel most comfortable at while learning, just like they would while going to school. Parents wouldn't have to be worried about they're kid being bu llied because they're attending school at home where nobody would bother them. Online classes would also give students chance to make friends online and have a social life while learning at home.

Online classes may also have some bad outcomes such as, students could be cheating on assignments and test using the internet or asking family members for help. Not every everyone have what it takes to afford a laptop or computer, sometimes the case may even be having access to a internet may be the problem for others. Some students will not be willing to do work since they're be forced to do it while being at home. Another issue is students might be having a hard time understanding the online tools or the teacher while being taught online.Â
