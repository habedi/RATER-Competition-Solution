Luke had a really great time when he was with the UNRRA, and he almost did it for free, and chances are if he did you can to. You almost do it for free, you can have a fun time, you get to go to a lot of neat places, you don't have to be 18 to join, you get experience with animals, and best of all you don't have to have much experience.

First thing's first, you don't have to use big bucks to join, you really just have to sign up and hope for the best. In the story Luke didn't know much about it but he still couldn't turn the opportunity down.

Secondly, you would have a lot of fun. You'd get to play basketball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, and boxing in the empty holds where the animals used to be to help pass time on your way back.

Thirdly, you got to go to a lot of neat places. When you got to your destination you have to do something, so why not go site seeing. For example, if you were going to Rome, go see the Colosseum or see the Acropolis in Greece.

Fourthly, you don't have to be 18 to join. You can be 17, or 16 but I'm pretty sure you have to graduate highschool before you can join.

Fithly, you get experience with animals. On Luke's first trip, he had 335 horses and you could have also had cattle as well.

Sixthly, you don't have to have much experience with animals or with water. You just have to be on guard because anything can happen.

Lastly, you would be helping others and yourself because you are becoming more responsable and you are giving back to people who need it most.

In conclosion, you should really join the UNRRA today and make a difference in not just your neighborhood but also around the world.
