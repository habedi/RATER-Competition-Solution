First, I agree and disagree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, do you? I think some students like learning by themselves, but some get distracted or may even rely on someone to show them the ways of learning. If the student works better on their own than I think classes at home is a great option. Therefore, the parents and their child should sit down and plan a learning schedule for them to follow full of due dates, so then, they don't fall behind. If the student has trouble working alone than I don't think classes at home is the best option, so there might be another reason why the student doesn't want to go to school, such as, being bullied or no friends. Lastly, parents might not even be there all the time to help their child or they don't know how to answer your questions they have.

Secondly, do you work independently? Some students work better by themselves and some don't. If your student decides to have classes at home than I think their should be a meeting of some type with the parents and child to dicuss it. If they agree, I think they need to sit down and create a work pace schedule full of due dates so the chilid doesn't fall behind. Maybe the student has trouble focusing around others and wants to learn from home. The greatest thing about working at home is the student can work at their own pace. Then, they can do other things during the day and get their work done before the due date instead of rushing at school to get the things done in one night that you got the same day. Sometimes it may help the student work harder when they work at their own pace.

Third, some students work better with others. They might need help on an assignment or they might even need help understanding something no one around them knows either. Some get distracted or even do other things to get their mind off of doing work, for an example, going out with friends, cleaning the house, getting on social media by using their phones or even watching television. All those things are distracting for everyone. Sometimes, there might be another reason why the student doesn't want to go to school and is eager to stay home. Maybe they're getting bullied by another kid at school or they don't have friends to hang out with. The question mostly every parent asks when the child stays home a lot from school is "Is something happening at school I don't know about?". Most of time the child doesn't want to tell their parents they don't have friends or are being bullied because they don't want to start something or even talk with their parents about it, so then they make up an excuse to stay home.

Last but not least, parents can't help all the time. Parents may have to work and are too busy. They might not remember learning about the things we learn now because time changes. They might've done things differently or didn't think it was important for their future job so they didn't listen much. Some might check up on their child and they might consider lying and telling them they finshed their work for the month but haven't even started. They might think their child is doing good and is learning what they need but when they go to take their GED they might fail according to the lack of learning they had. Therefore, it's important for family to help you sometimes but most of the time you have to learn things on your own in your own way to get anywhere in life.

Lastly, I think students should have an opinion on wheither they want to work at home or in schools. If they want to work at home, than I think there should be lots of planning and talking involved. Maybe when the parents think their child is ready, they can make a decision. Sometimes, classes at home aren't meant to be for some students. No parent wants their child to do bad in life and not get the education they need but also, want their child to feel comfortable by getting the learning they need to accomplish future life goals.
