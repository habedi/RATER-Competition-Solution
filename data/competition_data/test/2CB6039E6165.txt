I agree with Policy number 2. I think that cell phones should not be allowed in school, because it wouldn't really make much sense to have them during free time when you just talk to your friends face to face. Cell phones are a distraction to school work. If the school allowed students to keep their cells phones for just free times and lunch, then they probably wouldn't put them away after those times. They are a distraction, and it would keep students eyes off their homework and school work.

Student's cell phones should be used on buses, on the way home, and just your house. Not the school building. If they were to be used during free times it might just wash away all the information just learned by the student. All of school hours should be kept just school hours. No texting and calling times.

Cell phones can be a cheating tool used. During the free times the students get they can text each other the answers to tests, quizzes, and/or homework. It wouldn't matter if it's free time or lunch, it can still be accomplished during that time.

I think that the principal should just stick with the no cell phones policy, if they want their students to stay on track and do their school work.

Teachers having cell phones is okay, because they already know all this information that's why they teach it. Although, they shouldn't have it out constantly because the cell phone is just going to get in the way of teaching the class what they need to know for their future. So if the teachers are texting during class they are just ruining the students future. I wouldn't think that would happen though.
