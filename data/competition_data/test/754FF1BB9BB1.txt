Dear Principal,

Cell phones are an important thing in students lives, and are an important part in their lives.

In school some students need to get a hold of their parents for something important.

Students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch and passing time, but be off before class starts.

In school many times I have needed to get a hold of my mom or dad to tell them that basketball practice has been canceled or I don't need them to sign me up for something I can sign it up at school. If I was able to use my phone during passing time or at lunch it would be a lot easier for my parents and I to communicate and it would cause less confusion for my family.

I know of many students that need to get a hold of their family or someone but they cannot because we cannot use cell phones and the office will not allow a student to use the office phone.

My cousin goes to Novi high school and they are allow to use their cell phones at points during the school day and it has never caused any problems.

Students should be allowed to use their cell phones during passing time and in lunch.

If student were allowed to do this it would make all family's lives a lot easier.

If the parent knows that the student needs to be picked up from school it will allow the student to get home from school earlier making it easier to do their homework right, and with high quality.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
