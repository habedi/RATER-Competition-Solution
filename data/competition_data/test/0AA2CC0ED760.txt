Dear Principal,

Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, to be used during lunch periods and or free time. Cell phone usage has increased in the last five to ten years and is an important gadget for everyday life. People have social lives in school and cell phones are a very important way to communicate socially as well as in emergencies. Cell phones may be a distraction and can disrupt the learning environment of the class that is why it should be used during lunch hours. you may agree or disagree with my view on usage of cell phones in school , but most of the students at school agree with me. Also cell phone usage is not harmful towards the education of a student if used during parts of school time where no one is teaching.

Many people including you may think that there are so many negative point in cell phone usage during lunch but actually it really is not. If you think about it lunch is used to socialize and so is free time. So during the period of lunch, kids who are sick or on vacation can communicate with friends at school at that time, also if you are planning to go somewhere and you want tell your family beforehand you can give them a call or send a text, or if you just want to talk to someone in a different school you can if cell phone usage is allowed. there might be negatives to, but that can be easily turned positive.

Cell phones also can be disruptive during class, and we all know that if cell phones are allowed to be used there must be some rules and regulations and I have come up with some. First cell phones should not be used during class time. All phones should be placed on silent and any cell phone should not interfere with the learning environment during any class. If any of these rules are violated you may come up with your own consequences and enforce them. So please take this letter into consideration and hopefully you will listen to the voice of many kids and allow cell phone usage during lunch hours or free time.
