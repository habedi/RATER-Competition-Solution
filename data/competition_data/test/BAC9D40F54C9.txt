Contrary to popular belief, the Face on Mars is not a face, but a natural landform on the surface of Mars. Now, this may be hard to agree with, but the Face is actualy a structure similar to a butte or a mesa, a semi-flat landform common in the American west. It should also be noted that the area around Cydonia (a region on Mars on which the Face is located on,) is extremely cloudy around the time the pictures were taken by the Viking 1 in 1976. Also, Cydonia has many other mesa-like structures that are quite common in the area. The manner in which the Face was formed is unknown, but many scientists belive that shadows formed from outcrops in the area created the illusion of the eyes, the nose, and the mouth on the structure, giving it it's facelike apperence. There were three diffrent gruops of photographs taken of this structure. The first was taken by the aformentioned Viking 1, in 1976. The second was taken on April First, 1998, by The Mars Global Surveyer. The last one was taken in April of 2001, again by the Mars Global Surveyer. If this was a face, would'nt all three pictures be the same, insted of the last two being clear eveidence that the Face isen't a face at all, but rather a naturaly forming landmass? So, in conclusion, there is a scientific explanation to just why and how this strange and peculuar structure came to be. Even though this unusual sight looks just like a face, it's just a rock structure on the face of a red planet we call mars, not an ancient Martian temple.
