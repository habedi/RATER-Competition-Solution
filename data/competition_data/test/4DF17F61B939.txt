Driving using a phone?

When you are driving down the road and you get a phone call do you wait till you stop to answer it. Or do you answer immediately while your hands in the wheel. Do you think people should do that?

In my opinion i think people should not be able to use their phone but only on emergency. Have something to hold your phone up or a magnet on your dashboard. So if you get a call or text you dont grab and only using a finger and tap quick to answer it. Instead of grabbing it and putting it up to your ear. Doing that can prevent less crashes in my opinion because you you just give your phone a glance and a quick tap instead of holding it and trying to multi task looking at a phone and drive. By doing that you can be looking at the road and still give your phone a glance.

If you aren't allowed to use your on while driving. What happens if your wealthy businessman and you don't have anything bluetooth to talk to the person. How would you solve that problem but also that can be dangerous because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.

Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. But its a risk of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is Onstar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency they will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the nearest police, hospital and fire department giving them your exact location. Nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

In conclusion if people don't stop using phones while driving the percent in people dying in car crashes won't change.
