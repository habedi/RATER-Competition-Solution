The value of using this technology to read students' can be useful we do it in a every day life anyway when we look at our friends and can tell something is wrong,or when you come home and your mom can always tell something is wrong. These computers could tell if students do not understand and are confused , or if they do get it and understand.

These computers tracks your emotion-recognition as it states in paragh 4. Some kids are afriad to raise there hand you would not have to raise your hand then if you dont get it the teachers would already know that you dont get it. Dr. huang saw that artists studie human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to also so emotions as it states in paragh 5.

This could help out teachers and students alot. Students would not have to be scared when they are confused, teachers would know that you do not get it so they can help you out till you do get it. When u are just having a bad day teachers would know that and so they dont get on you for being angry when they call on you or try to talk to you. This is why i am for using technology to read students emostions expressions.
