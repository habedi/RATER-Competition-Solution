I think that considering changing the school policy is a good thing because then kid's would have good grade in school and they would still be able to do other activities in their school. Kid's should try to have a B average in school. They would get so many rewards with there parents like they would give them all they want if they had good grade. Having B average is something that i would be proud of and so would be my parent. Sometimes its just hard to do everything right all the time and try not to get anything wrong and do all your homework and make your teacher happy by doing everything they say. But sometime they can be really annoying once they tell do this they tell you to do other thing i mean can u make up your mind lady. Well yea all of that can get really annoying. All of theses thing they want us to do and when we don't do it right they get mad. Yeah having B average can pretty hard to keep. Well its still a good idea because it can prepare you for collage and other hard things to accomplish in the future and help you be a better person.
