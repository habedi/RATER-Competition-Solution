The author believe that studing Venus could bring good things regradless of its dangers. Life on another planet sounds crazy but Venus once, many years ago had earth like features that could maybe prove that Venus is actually worth studing. The real question is, can research be done on another planet with such high temperatures? I believe the risk isn't worth the struggle but finding put more about Venus could bring many benefits. Author claims yes it could be done with the right equipment but is it worth the risk.

Could people live on another planet with such high temperatures? Well the author claims in the article, " Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth" (The Challenge 4). This shows that life possibly existed in Venus many years ago and could maybe in the future carry human life. "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals" (The Challenge 3). With the right equipment, living on Venus could happen in the long future, but would people really what to live as robots in outter space avoiding the risks.

Life on a different planet could bring benefits in the long future. The author brought up many good reasons on why his idea of studing Venus is worthy of trying despite the dangers. With the right techology, maybe the authors claim can be proven and considered as another planet for life.
