But technolocial advancements are encouraging the further study of Venus and speeding up the process.

By teaching us that Venus is often referred to as Earth's "twin" and that it is relatively the closest planet to ours in the solar system, the author sees that "Stiving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity...Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation" (8). Meaning that the author supports the idea that studying Venus because the risk taken should be seen as a challenge needing to be conquered.

In Paragraph 7 the author states that "NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus...electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"(7). Thus demonstrating that the further studying of Venus is inevitable due to advancements that could decrease the possible risks of pursuing the sudy of Venus and eliminate the dangers.

In conclusion, the author supports the claim that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents because the knowledge to be gained is greater than or equal to the risks taken because the author sees it as a challenge rather than a risk, needing to be overcame. In additon, further technological advancements make studying Venus inevitable and is eliminating the problematic dangers that studying Venus presents.
