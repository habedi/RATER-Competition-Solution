Dear principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i believe that if you change the schools average grade level from a C to a B it will be catastrophic because many people cant focus on being at school for 7 to 8 hours having math, social studies, language art, and science class then they have to do all of there homework for those classes that would mean that they would have to do 2 to 3 hours of homework after practice or games, which can take up to 2 or 3 hours so it will 5 to 6 even 7 o'clock until some people get home and then having to do 2 to 3 hours of homework on top of that many students wont be going to bed until 10 to 11 o'clock at night and doctors say that kids and teens from ages 9-18 need about 9 hours of sleep a night to be healthy young adults and do good in school. Also if you have the change and the grade level is an average B many students might not get to play sports because they only have a grade average of a C and do you really think it's fair to those students that don' get that opportunity to play sports?
