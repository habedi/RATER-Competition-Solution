The Face on Mars is not fake. Some people think that a living thing created it and could be hiding out somewhere. NASA is trying to hide the enthusiasts that beleive such a thing. I recently had a converstaion with one of those enthusiasts.

"This mask is not made from aliens. This was a natural landform that created it self. There was nothing there that shows some life form lived there." I said.

"The thing that made it could have not been seen on your pictures." said the enthusiast.

"The machine we used to take the pictures, its pixels spans 1.56 meters. Once you saw them, you could zoom in on them. If there were any life forms on Mars, we would have seen it. Taking the pictures wasn't easy, You had to find the face first and then be able to take a picture. When we finally got the picture, it is more then likely that the cameras didn't mess up. Besides, what kind of thing would be able to create such a face?"

"You never know what's out there."

"Yes, we do, and we have no evidence of any living creautures on that planet. Therefore, it was made naturally."

The guy I talked to later became a beleiver that the face was a natural landform. He also got a job at NASA and devoted his job on finding out how the face was made. I honestly believe that the face was a natural landform and that there could be many more of those "faces" on other planets.
