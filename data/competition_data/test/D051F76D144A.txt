In this article "making Mona Lisa Smile", it talks about a computer technology that can tell your emotions. Having a computer be able to tell your emotions would be pretty interesting right? Or would it just be creepy? If we fully develop computer programs that can tell our emotions and make something interesting based on our emotions like it states in paragraph 6. If the lesson we are learning in school changed based on our emotions do you think students would learn more? I do.

If we had lessons in school based on our emotions and how we felt about the subject; the computer could reconize if we were into the lesson or not. If we could have this technology and our lessons changed in a way that could make students want to learn a subject that on a daily basis made them want to fall asleep in the class or they just could not find a way to get themselves interested, the computer could change that for them. This technology could be very useful for our upcoming generations. People already know that we are slowly going to become more of a digital world so if we had these programs set up for kids to go their own pace and learn things that intrest them we could have shorter school days and more time for children to be kids and have fun in their life.

There is a large population of students who choose not to come to school every day because school makes them unhappy or they just hate some of their classes because they know the job they want when they are older not everything they are learning is going to be needed in the outside world. If this technology could help us show what emotions we had towards different subjects then maybe it would help teachers understand how to teach their students the information in a way it wont go in one ear and out the other.

There are going to be people who disagree with this new technology becoming part of life, because they might not want the technology we have now. There will always be someone who is not happy with the way life around them is going because of technology and sometimes technology does fail us. Technology can shut down. Technology can make things we have worked hard for disappear in one second and we won't have all of our hard work anymore so what was once hard work in a second can become wasteful material.

Although there are people who are going to disagree with this technology and maybe spread rumors that it is faulty, we need this technology to help us better understand the world around us. Say a cop was trying to figure out a murder or suicide, if we had the technology to figure out what emotions they show it could tell us if they were murdered or if they commited suicide. This technology could really help us advance in life and learn how to understand things from new perspective.

This technology could be believed to improve our society and the way we learn, the way we educate our children, and the way we have an output on life itself. This technology could be a new meaning for life. It could make students learn to lie school. It could help us understand what is going on in someones life. It could maybe even help us solve crimes. Of course there is going to be people who will fight against this new technology but if we stick to it one day the technology can help us understand why these people are against it.
