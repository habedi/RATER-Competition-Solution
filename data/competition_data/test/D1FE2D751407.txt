Dear Principle,

Changing to that could be a good idea, except for the fact that a lot of kids might drop out and go to another.

It happened at my old school a lot, but another thing is being in sports will keep boys/girls grades up because they want to be in that extra activity.

I know this because it had happened to me i kept straight As year round because of that exact reason, I wanted to be in that subject.

But the reason it might be bad is because some kids just don't care about his/her grades they care about other things such as dating, sometimes drugs (rarely), and they also might have home issues causing them to not have good grades.

Not all kids can keep a grade average of Bs, they sometimes just aren't good learners, i wasn't a good learner in elementary but you cant make anyone smarter, my suggestion is to recommend a learning care system like Sylvan.

If you want that good of grades from every one then that must be one good school or your expecting to much from them.

I've never seen a school policy that says you cant do this unless you have a B or better at least a C or C+.

My look on it is either change to a C+ or don't change at all because most kids get Cs or better including my self.

Its your school so do what u like, but if you want students to be plentiful there don't change it at all, that's my recommendation and that's all i should really say.

Hoping the best for you and your school,

P.S You really shouldn't change it, it probably wont turn out well.
