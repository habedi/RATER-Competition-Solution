Join. You should join or participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. This is an opportunity of a lifetime, so you can join. "I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of the people of other countries and their needs." said Luke Bomberger and "My life changed soon after my high school graduation."

The adventure starts on a cattle boat. "This is an unbelievable opportunity for small-town boys." said Luke. "We help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more." It will take time to get to places where people might need help, like two weeks to around a month, or even more. If you can last that long on a boat then give this a try. I got to tour unique places like; an excavated castle in Crete and the Panama Canal on my way towards China. Besides helping people, I got to see and experience being in; the Acropolis in Greece, and going on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. When the animals were unloaded, especially on return trips we would play baseball and volleyball games, where the animals used to be. "Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games were played to help pass the time on board."

Now that you what happens and what we do, you should join our program. This is an opportunity of your lifetime. "I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of the people of other countries and their needs." said Luke Bomberger and "My life changed soon after my high school graduation." It is your choice, to be a cowboy or not.
