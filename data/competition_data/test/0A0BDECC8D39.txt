Driverless cars should be incouraged because there are so many positve benefits that come from it like the fact that individuals would have easier transportaion. It could also possibly be good for the economy because the less fuel the car intakes. Another probable benefit would be non-use of oil since the cars could be controlled by electricity. It could be, with the right type of technology, safer than a regular car.

These benefits can be shown when the author says, " The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus." The author also says, " Without the option of smarter roads manufacturers turned to smarter cars-but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors...The combonation of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel." This is significant because these drivelrerss cars can use gas more efficeintly and possibly stop the use of oil. It is also significant because with all these sensors, maybe in the future, the driverless car can be safer because it will act as if a human were actually driving a car, and it could mimic the way we drive more accurately.

In conclusion Driverless Cars are a positive future investment because of the many benefits that come from it. Like the effecient use of gas and the deduction of oil used. Also the possibility of a very safe interface due to the advanced technology utilized. Though in the end these driverless cars will mostly benefit our everday lives. Like in the way we travel, it could be a faster way of transportation than regular cars. This investment can change the world.
