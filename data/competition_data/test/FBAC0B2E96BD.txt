Could it be an alian? The Face that appear on Mars is not an alian or a creature its a natural landform. The photos that were taken showed like an Egyptian Pharaoh or a fave called the Face. The scientis at NASA made a research about it.

First on 1976, the Vinking's photo was taken. In that photo it showed that there was a face on Mars. You might think that it was an alian or that their is life on Mars. The photo didn't showed so many details. The camera did't have good quality, you couldn't tell what it really was.

Later on, on 2001 another photo was taken. This time the camera had a better quality. Each pixel was 1.56 meters compare to the old photo that it was 43 meters per pixel. You could see the Face three times bigger. The details where much more clear.

Eventually taking all those photos, the scientist finally came out with an answer. Garvin was saying that," If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" All those things he listed were natural landforms on Earth. So as the Face on Mars. The picture shows a Martian like butte or mesa.

After all the research Garvin says, " That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." By saying that its pretty clear that is was any of what you may be thinking. Before all the research I though it was an alian or a creture too . Now there is nothing to worry about is just a natural landform just like Earth have some too.
