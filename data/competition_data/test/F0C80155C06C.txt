dear, SCHOOL_NAME faculty i don't think that it is fair that you have to maintain a B average to participate in sports or other activities. and im telling you this mainly because if that happens then students are going to drop out are not come to school and give up on there dreams. because most people love sports and other things and we already work hard enough to maintain a C average and most people cant make A or B so its going to be hard on them & there most likely to drop out, sell drugs, or most people might wined up dead are cant stay out of trouble. and im sure it would make most parents mad and a lot of trouble and things would happen if we were to do that so me as a student and as a person who cant always maintain a B average. and im the best that they have on the team i work my butt off just to stay on the team and just to stay in sports so if this was to happen i would just quick the team and move away from here. because i don't think it fair that it should be that way. and im sure that other students just like me feel the same and i know for a fact that my family wouldn't appreciate that because they come to all my games, school activities, and to see me give up on my dreams would really hurt them. it would hurt my mom the most because she would give anything for me or my family to live the dreams we always wonted to and should will go out of her way just to make it possible she tells us to stay in school and never give up so if that happens i just don't no what i would do.

and don't no where i would go.
