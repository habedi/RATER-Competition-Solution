Distance learning is becoming very popular in my generation. You can easily sign up for an online classes, or classes instead of having to actually go to school to learn. There can be many reasons for a student to do this, some students may not work well in the school environment, some students may have certain jobs so online school helps them to create thier own schedule, or maybe there is even a deadly viras going around and they have to put students in online school so they can get work dont from home. Taking online school can be very beneficial to students that desire to do so.

Some students out there don't enjoy the public school environment. Sometimes it is the teacher, the students around them, or maybe they are struggling with a disorder or a diseas. This is where online school can come in hand. Doing online school gives the student a safe place they can go where all they have to do is sit in their bed, open their computer and they are at school. You don't have to worry about the stress of not liking your teacher, or even how you are being treated. From personal expierence a handful of teachers that we have in our public schools today forget that they were like us once and had no idea what a certain topic was about, and probably even struggled with it. They often get frustrated with us when we don't catch on as quickly. Or they just try to get through lessons rather than teaching them. But with onlice school you are able to go at your own pace without having any trouble or distractions around you. Something that other students can also struggle with is bullying. For some, school is not an enjoyable safe place for them where they can freely learn without being bothered. Which of course is not ok by any means and if a student is stuggling with this they should tell an adult. But, there are cases where the student wants to be taken out of that environments, so that's where online learning comes in so they don't have to deal with the stress of everyone else and they can focus on their education. Now, there are also students that struggle with diseases and disorders. There are certain illneses that can cause you to be in the hospital for long periods of time, so you can't go to school, or school is not a safe place for you to be because of all the germs and crowded hallways. You can bring your computer anywhere and get all of your work done, which can take someones mind off of things and make them feel like they are working at something and to keep going. Online school is a safe place for students to learn and get their education without having to worry about anything else.

There are students that have to become the parent of the household sometimes, because they need more money, or they have an absent parent. This can put a lot of pressure on a kid my age. We don't really think too much about paying bills, or having to buy groceries, or worring about when our next pay check will come in. But, there are students out there that have to worry about that. They work two or three jobs to support thier family, which leaves little to no time for school. Online schooling gives you more free time because you are able to make your own schedule. You don't have to worry about waking up on time, then going straight to your job after school, then having to go home super late and get all of your work done. You can take your computer anywhere you want, at any time you want, and sit down and get your work done. This can take loads of stress off of a student that shouldn't be stressed out about things that we normally would relate to our parents stressing about, but at times some people get put in certain cercumstances.

Now, something that is going on right now is the Corona virus. This virus is spreading all around the world and killing many. So one place where most of us students get sick from is school. There are hundreds and sometimes thousands of students touching so many surfaces in our schools each day. These surfaces aren't getting disinfected every second of the day so this is why so many kids end up getting sick from school. In my area there have been 2 reported cases of the corona virus. Schools are now talking about closing the schools and putting us all into online classes since it will be a substantial time out of the classroom. Putting us in these online classes keeps us all caught up on our work from home. None of us will have to worry about catching this deadly diseas, and it keeps the teachers safe too. So doing the online classes is going to benefit us because we won't fall behind and have a huge load of work to do, and it takes stress off of teachers so they don't have to worry about having to teach us tons of lessons in a short amount of time.

So in conclusion having these online classes can really benefit all kinds of students in many ways. You go to class on your own time, from the comfort of your own home or wherever you may choose to do you work. Being a good student is something we all strive for, and none of us want any unwanted distractions. There is no need to worry about anything else around you. You are able to get your education, and succeed in an easy and comfortable way.
