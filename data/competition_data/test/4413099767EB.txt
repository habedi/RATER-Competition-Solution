Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This could be beneficial to some students depending on the situation. This opportunity could allow for the learner to flourish rater than drown by being overwhelmed. This could also be beneficial for those who struggle with being still for eight hours at school to be able to take a break every so often. It would be a good opportunity to those who are: being bullied, having trouble with mental health, and struggling with a unsuitable learning environment.

Students often say that school is enjoyable because their friends are there. However, there are some students who struggle to find those friends, which could lead to the development of bullying. These bullies could be completely ruining a student's life and more often than not the teachers never do anything about it. This type of situation could be toxic and decrease in the development of the student. These students often begin to slowly distance themselves further from school progressively, which could lead to a down spiral in grades. Allowing for these struggling learners to work from home would allow them to be in a familiar environment with no one there to influence them as a person.

1 out of 10 students struggle with some sort of mental health issue whether it be anxiety or depression; everyone has something going on in their head. These students with this issue could have severe social anxiety. For example, if a student struggling with anxiety is in a school with 1,000 other kids it might cause the student to have an anxiety attack. This could cause them to slowly dislike the setting and they will begin to take days off from school because they want to avoid the chance of the attack entirely. The grades will plummet due to the absences, which is in the end not fair to these students struggling with the issue. The opportunity for these students to work in a peaceful environment will allow for them to flourish as a learner.

Students all have their own ways to retain information, some prefer visual, and others could prefer audible. This meaning that, everyone has some setting that works best for them. Some individuals could thrive in the school environment, while others could not. Given the opportunity, some students would take the chance to take the courses they regularly take at home. It could allow for these struggling students to take a break when needed and retain information better. This opportunity would be beneficial to the educational development of the student.

However, some students could abuse this opportunity as a way for them to stay home and do nothing. This could become unsuitable for those who need the extra push to do their work. These students could end up having too much free time on their hands and it could lead to the development of an unhealthy situation. This being said it understandable why the opportunity would not be given. But, the students who genuinely need this opportunity will not take advantage of it, they will use it to their benefit.

This opportunity that these struggling students would be offered would be extremely beneficial to their future. This option would be more beneficial than not as long as those who are given the option are monitored. This chance could allow them to reach their goals and accomplish achievements they never thought they could. The setting and the people in the school could be holding these learners back from achieving greatness. Not all people are in the same situation, not all struggle with the same things, people are victim to bullying, go though anxiety, and could not flourish in the environment their in. This chance would allow for the growth and development of the student mentally, physically, and emotionally.
