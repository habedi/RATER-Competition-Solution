Have you ever dreaded doing a summer reading project because the assignment was too complicated? Well now you can design your own summer reading project. Many students don't do their summer reading because it takes too much time and is too complicated. Those students who do their summer reading never get a major grade for it like they should. Students will get their project done quicker if they know they don't have to do a lot of other tasks. Summer reading projects should be student-designed because students know the expectations already, it will insure that they will complete the assignment, and students can have freedom and choice when it comes to their project.

First of all, summer reading projects should be student-designed because the students should already know the expectations from their teachers from past projects. For example, one summer i was doing my summer reading project and realized how little expectations the teachers have for us, students. I then outdid my work astronomically by achieving an 100 percent on the grade. I quickly realized that because i went above and beyond on this project that the teachers wouldn't have cared about what book i read or wrote about. I believe that teachers have low expectations for students and that students actually have high expectations for themselves. When students are able to set their own expectations they can do extraordinary things; that goes for anything. Another example of this is when football players or even soccer players go to games. They always have the mindset of expecting the best but preparing for the worst. In this case with something as easy as a summer reading project you can always expect the best from yourself; especially if they are designed by students for students.

Second of all, summer reading should be student-designed because it will insure that they complete the assignment. Almost always when a teacher gives out an assignment students dread doing it because they feel like they have to do it to succeed. This is not the case, students should not feel like they're being forced to do an assignment the assignment should be fun, yet still have good key points. For example, one summer i absolutely dreaded doing my summer reading project. I dreaded doing the assignment because it wasn't any fun like it should be; it was literally a essay. I remember thinking "Oh great i have to do essays during the school year and during summer". I thought this because it is really boring to do essays all the time, and any student can vouch on that. I also was thinking this because the essay had to be about a book from the list given out. Which brings me to my next point.

Lastly, if students are able to design their own summer reading projects then they can choose whatever book they want and they can choose what kind of assignment they do. I think this is a good method because not all students read the same kind of book genres; i personally like horror, thriller and action. Someone else could like fantasy and mythic books. Everyone has different interests and everyone has different dislikes. Someone that likes non-fiction could just absolutely hate fiction. Another good reason is that students wont be stuck doing boring essays all the time, in fact they could do an interview, a poster, or even a brochureÂ trying to persuade people to read the book while still giving a great amount of information about the book.

In conclusion, summer reading projects should be student-designed because students know the expectations already, it will insure that they will complete the assignment, and students can have freedom and choice when it comes to their project. Many students don't do their summer reading because it takes too much time and is too complicated. Those students who do their summer reading never get a major grade for it like they should. Students will get their project done quicker if they know they don't have to do a lot of other tasks. Contact your local school board and get them to make summer reading fun!!
