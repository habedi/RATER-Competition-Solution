The discussion of driverless cars, is a big one. Some people believe that they will be safer, more fun, and easier to use. And then there are some people who believe that autonomous cars are not a very good idea. I believe that autonomous cars shouldn't be used until they can do everything that a human can behind the wheel.

I do not think that autonomous cars should be used in public until they are perfected. There are quite a few reasons why they should not be used yet. First, they can only drive in specific weather conditions. Secondly, They are not completely driverless. To me, a driveless car means that there doesn't even have to be another person in the car for it to perform like a regular vehicle. Thirdly, the cars will be very expensive with alot of technology on them. The cars with have sensors all over the car, 3-D mapping technology, and cameras. And i do not trust car munufacturers with video footage of random people.

Finally, i don't believe that driverless cars should be used yet because they can only go 25 mph by themselves. Which means they can only be driven on side streets mainly. You can't drive them on open roads and on the interstate because those speed limits range from 30 mph to 70 mph. I believe that driverless cars can be useful when they are perfected, but until then i'll stick with manually driven trucks.
