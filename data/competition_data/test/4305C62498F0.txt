Dear, principle

Some students are taking community service and some are not.

I think we should all help in cleaning our environment.

Without this beautiful environment we would not be speaking today.

We would not enjoy having games and friends to play with.

We should all have at least 30 min each day going around recycling, or throwing away trash.

There are people who would not like this idea, but it is best we do this for our community.

If we keep this up not picking up or doing anything to help the earth.

This whole earth will be in trash and more people will die from an increased chance to get a dieses.

If we were just to throw our plastics on the ground, birds or rabbits will eat it then they will choke and die while we watch and do nothing about it.

There has been more than 1 million birds die and I don't want to sit here watching.

Many people will volunteer, others will be forced to but if were going to change the earth we better do it know.

People want to learn and work in a clean environment.

They don't want food that has a piece of plastic or mud on it.

We need clean place to study, live, and enjoy life.

There have been more than 250 bottles under the bleachers at the football field.

If we could pick that up and recycle we saved at the earth that much more.

I suggest we have a group that does community service.

We will have shifts like group 1, group 2, group 3, etc.

We will change the earth as much as we can.

Thank you for listening.

Thank You,
