School is a place where students can come and learn from educators who are experts in the field that they teach. Students come to school in order to learn material from them and to gain a better understanding of concepts that would be difficult to learn on their own. They use teachers in order to help them learn certain key concepts. Students attending classes online would not benefit them in any way, proving that learning in a traditional classroom setting is far more beneficial to the students than taking the classes online.

The first reason why attending classes from home is a bad idea is because students learn better when they are able to communicate with others. For instance, learning from a teacher in person is more helpful because a student can ask follow up questions and get answers instantly. When learning a hard concept about chemistry, my friend was not able to fully understand the concept and needed additional information. My friend then asked follow up questions about the topic, and the teacher was able to address the issue and resolve any further misunderstandings. My friend would not have been able to get an answer that fully explains the topic if he had to learn it online without being able to properly communicate to a teacher. This situation explains the need for a teacher, because online, help would not have been provided at the exact moment when my friend needed help. Students also need to be able to communicate with other classmates in order to understand things if the teacher is not explaining a topic in a way that is understandable to every student. In biology, my teacher was not able to explain it in a way that my friend would understand. Due to this, others around the friend attempted to help teach the concept to him to help him better understand the topic. This is an important factor of schools, one that would be lost from distance learning. Without collaborating with others, certain people might not understand important topics. Communicating with others will help students learn better, which would be lost if distance learning was implemented.

Another reason why attending in person classes can benefit a student better is it gives them access to new materials and encourages them to learn the material. In person, people have papers and worksheets provided to them by a teacher that will properly address the topic and give them practice to learn the material. When my friend was talking an online class, he didn't have papers or notes that explained concepts to him. He had to searchÂ through the internet in order to find explanations, but he wasn't able to find a source that would explain it to him properly. In a classroom setting, a student would have access to notes given to them by the teacher that could address any mistakes and give them an easy way to understand a concept. Online teaching often doesn't provide understandable notes that simplify the content because the content is addressed to people of either higher or lower skill levels. A teacher would be able to evaluate the skill level of a student and give them worksheets according to the skill level of the student. A student will also better learn material if they have to learn it in a classroom. In an economy class, students are forced to learn the topics on their own by reading a textbook at home and taking notes. The teacher does not check to see if the student completes the notes, and this leads to many students not attempting to read the textbook. If the teacher had made them take notes in class, the students would have had to complete the task and they would be motivated to finish because they wouldn't want to have to do them at home. Students would rather complete assignments in class than have to do them at home. Therefore, distance learning is not beneficial since students would have access to new material and would be encouraged to learn if they do it in a classroom.

The final reason why distance learning wouldn't be beneficial is because students would feel more comfortable learning in a classroom environment than learning at home. At school, students realize that they are there to learn and so they make use of the time they spend their by absorbing the information they get. At home, students would feel stressed and would not be able to learn because they have a different mindset at home. Personally, when I am at school, I learn better because the environment around me encourages me to learn. At home, that opportunity is taken away because I am more likely to do activities that will not help me learn rather than sitting down and taking time to learn important concepts. Learning at home, people would not feel any pressure to learn because no one is able to make sure that they work, and a school environment prevents that. By taking the time to go to school, students are better equipped to learn properly. At home they would do activities that would take time away from learning. That is why a comfortable space such as school allows students to learn better than if they were to learn at home.

In person learning, or traditional learning, is far more beneficial to students than online learning. Attending classes in person allows people to communicate with others to learn the material better. It also allows people to have access to worksheets or new material, and encourages them to learn the concepts. The other reason why students wouldn't benefit from attending classes at home is that they would feel more comfortable learning in a classroom environment. Schools were created to benefit students and to help them learn and in person schooling benefits them more than distance learning.
