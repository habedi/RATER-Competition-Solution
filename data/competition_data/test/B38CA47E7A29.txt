Dear Principal,

I think we should have to perform community service, but not a lot because we are kids and still get homework and have to go to school which takes up most time on weekdays. Most students would probably say that we should not have community service because the weekend is our only time to relax, and sometimes teachers give homework on the weekends too. But I think we can relax weekday nights and do a couple hours of community service a week. I also think that if you truly care for your community then you can take time to make sure it stays clean, or to help a smaller child with school work because any community service can make the community a better place with better living conditions. Taking care of the community is very important because we are the next generation and we should care about where we live and if it is clean environment, and children get help with school work or homework, or if it is a pig-sty and trash is everywhere because no one wants to, or has to clean it up, and no one cares about helping the children with their work.

sincerely, student
