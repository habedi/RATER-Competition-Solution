Dear, Principal

I think policy 1 is the correct, because students should be able to bring there cell phones to school and use them during lunch, and other free time. I'm convincing you that cell phones is right for student to use in a matter of good hands and don't do nun else with them and don't pass around them at lunch or at other free times. What if there a very harsh problem and there mom or dad trying to get in hold of them and call there cell phones and tell them where to go, what to do, where they at, go put up your brother or sister, or something? And you as the principal say no you can't answer or put up your phone, and there mom or dad take it out on you. So i think {Policy 1} is the answer because all school should allow students to bring and use there cell phones during lunch periods and other free times, as long the phones are turned off during class time. Take my supports and examples as long as you do it the easy way and take policy 2 the students will go behind your back and do it the hard way and bring there cell phones to school and put them in there bag or locker what ever they have and go with policy 1. So principal let the students bring there cell phones to school. There's no reason students should not have cell phones in school, there are supports and other things.

POLICY 1 YEAH!
