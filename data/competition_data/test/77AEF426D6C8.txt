Summer break is the time when students get to relax and forget about everything they learned about during the school year. Many teachers design a summer project to help this dilemma. Teachers should let students design their own summer projects. This helps students want to do the assignment and they can make it suit them intellectually.

When teachers give summer projects they have made, students tend to not do it. This is because they might think it is boring or they just do not want to do it. There are more interesting activities for kids to do during the summer. So, if they do not like it, they will decide to do those activities instead of the project. For example, when I was younger, my teacher gave us a project where we were required to read the book and answer the questions. The whole summer I would pull it out and then put it right back; then go play outside with my cousins. The reason I did not do it was, because it did not catch my attention enough for me to even get started. I had not learned anything all summer and my teacher was not happy. She was even more disappointed when she learned none of the class had even touched the book. The idea of us learning and keeping our brains educated had failed. Students need a project that is going to catch their attention and keep it there. The summer project would have been more effective if she had allowed us to do our own project.

If students make their own project, they can make it suit them more comfortably. A student may not understand the topic of the project their educator has assigned them. Then, they end up not doing it at all, simply because they cannot comprehend it. A student knows their own intellect, therefore they can make a project that is not difficult for them. Once my friend had a teacher would always assigned them hard summer projects. She would always be puzzled and never got to finish them. So, the next summer her teacher finally decided to let them make their own projects. My friend successfully made her own assignment and aced it when she got back the next school year. It becomes easier for a student when they have made a project that they can really understand.

Many people believe that teachers should assign the project, because they know the criteria. However, this is a false statement, just because a teacher knows more does not mean they can create a project that happily suits their students. This is because they will actually do their summer project if it fun and interesting. They also can make the material geared more towards their level of knowledge of a subject. To help, teachers could wait a month before the end of the year and let the students come up with their own personal project that is fun to them. They could set aside class time every day, so students can perfect their assignment and have a intriguing summer project.Â
