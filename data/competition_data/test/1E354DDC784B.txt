Everyday, when it comes to school, students are always absent for whatever reason. Regardless of what the reason is many teachers still believe you should come anyway. Students would benefit from video conferencing because students will not have to worry about being absent, and students are more comfortable at home.

With video conferencing, students will be able to work most of the time. Teachers will not have to worry about students being out because they are sick. People will not have to worry about students spreading germs. Also students can get whatever they need so they can feel better at home. Makeup work will not be a problem for students because they will always know what they have to do. It will be easier for students to catch up on work that they miss since they would not have to come to school in order to get it. And students grades will stay high because they will not have any missing grades in the grade book. Also, students can have video conferences wherevever they go. If they have to go to an appointment of some sort, they can still attend all the classes. Eventhough students will need an interent connection to do this, if they can get one then students will not have to worry about missing school work wherever they are.

Students are way more comfortable at home then at school. At home, students can wear whatever they would like to wear because there is no dress code. Students will not have to worry about teachers telling them to go to the office because of their clothing. Students will not have to worry about being late because they could not find what they wanted to wear for that day. Many students also will not have to worry about bullying. Whether someone is witnessing it or it is being done to them, students will not have to worry about this since they will not be around others. Students will have less stress since they will not have to worry about bullies and become focused on their schoolwork. Lastly, students will not have to worry about supension. With video conferencing, students can not get into to fights with other students. Students can not get suspended for being late to class or for skipping school.

In conclusion, video conferencing solves many issues. Students will almost always be available to work, and even if they are abesent they can catch up easier. Students can also be comfortable at home wearing whatever they would like to wear, avoiding school bullies, and avoiding suspension. Schools should really implement this into their system so that students can benefit in these ways.
