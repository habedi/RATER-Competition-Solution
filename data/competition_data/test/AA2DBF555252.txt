Limiting car usage in america would be a great idea! For one  it would make some of the pollution go away and for two our government can find ways for more buildings with walking space instead of parking spaces. This way we can have stores in walking distance instead of driving distance and we will be safe by doing so.

By limiting our car usage we can save the planet from the pollution and saving people as well. In the article '' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' it says that '' cars are responsible for for 50 persent in some car-intensive areas in the United States''. Thats alot!. If we were to limit car usage we could make that number 50 dissapear. It would be alot better for the planet .

When people drive cars they dont know the damage they are doing. when we drive cars it causes pollution to exit our car and enter the air. Thats why it would be safer tolimit our car usage. in the article '' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' it says that '' In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather thanin malls along some distant highway''. this is saying that if we limit our car usage  we can walk to the stores rather than waste your time driving to them. I do agree with them.

Important people like Mr. president Obama are encouraging us to ''chill out'' on car usage.  In the article ''the end of car culture '' it states that recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer license as each year goes by. This is  showing that  people do care about their enviornment and want to help. They also support the idea of walking . That goes to show that people are wanting to do something about this pollution. Well lets face it America can use the Exersize!
