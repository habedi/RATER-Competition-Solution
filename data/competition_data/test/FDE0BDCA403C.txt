Students would not benefit from home learning and should be in present in school. In order to have a more firm and solid education. It would be more beneficial for students to be present, and not at home learning from a computer or video. But ulitmitly it should be based on what type of learner you are.

If students take classes online or for example be home schooled, then it takes many aspects of class environment and school away. Some examples of that are, In school many people learn from teachers teaching in person and explaining things vocally. Witch for most people would be more beneficial then having someone explain topics online. It could possibly be harder to retain lots of information. Students who choose to take classes online could also be at a disadvantage by not being able to hear multiple peoples opinions on certain topics as well.

People should take classes at school because it also teaches you social skills and how to work with other people. Being at school can teach you many different things, like working as a team and learning how to deal with other peoples opinions. You can gain leadership skills and social skills that can set you up for a career and life.

If you do take classes online then it can have an impact of possible friendships exposure to possible great resources and advice of how to further your knowledge. It also limits you time for help if you do not understand or struggle in some sort of subject.

For people that can and have the ability to sit down and retain information from a video or online then that could possibly be a good idea if you do not want to go to school it can benefit certain people. Different people have different types of learning styles, Witch could make other people better off. Or some people want to be alone and have no distractions so they can focus on their schooling. But still the majority of people probably wont benefit from online classes, they might even be trickier and more confusing then if you have a teacher explaining and teaching in person.

With all being said Personally I do not think students would benefit from out of school or online classes. It would not be as helpful to people then going to school and being taught in person by teachers. It is not worth it. People would be able to strive in the real world more if going to school rather than taking classes online.
