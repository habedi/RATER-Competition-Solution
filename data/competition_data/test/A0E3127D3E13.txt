Some schools make kids do summer projects to assure they continue to learn on their break. In my opinion, I think that the projects should be student-designed. I think that because some teachers might be to hard on their students and make them do to much work. For example, teachers might make the projects to long and not give students enough time to enjoy their breaks. Another reason why I think the projects should be student-designed is because the sutdents can choose a topic they enjoy and not have to do a project based on somehting they dislike for the whole summer. I also think it'd be a good idea for the projects to be student-designed is because the student can time him or herself and complete the project in time for the next school year and not fail.

If the summer projects are teacher-designed, the teacher could take advantage and make their students do way to much for their break. If the students end up having to do to much work over their break then whats the point of even taking a break? Students will end up hating their summer breaks when in reality the summer break is supposed to be the best time of the year to enjoy the outdoors and do all kinds of fun stuff. They wouldn't have to use up to much time focusing on their project and have time to spend it with friends and family. What if that sttudent had already made plans to go on a family trip and come back with no time to do the summer project because it was to long?

Imagine having to do a school project that takes up the whole summer that is based on something a teacher would enjoy doing. If the school projects were student-designed they could make a project based on what they like doing. It's bad enough they have to do a school project over the summer but they can at least enjoy doing the project if it was student-designed. For example, if I were to make a school project it would most likely be about science because it envolves fun science expierements that could be done outside in nice weather. Doing a project that was designed by me would mean that I could do fun stuff and learn at the same time that way I could enjoy my summer and get a good grade with no problem.

If the summer project was student-designed they can plan out the project and make time for it so they can turn in the project fully complete. For example, they can make trips with friends and family and plan out what they need to do for their projects and how much time they would have left to do fun stuff. If the project was designed by a teacher they wouldn't know what to expect and would have to cancel on some trips they had alrady made just for a school project but, if the project was designed by a student then they could possibly include their friends and family into the project and everyone could have fun and enjoy summer. The students wouldn't have to worry as much about the project grade because they would have already done it and complete by the time the next school year comes around.

In conclusion, the best choice would be to make the school projects student-designed. everything would be just right for that student and can assure teachers that most of them would complete the school projects. With the project being not to much work they can enjoy their summer. if the project were to be about a subject the student likes they would have fun and learn at the same time during the summer. The students would have a huge advantage if they could plan everything out and have good time for the project if it was student-designed. At the end of the day, both teachers and students would be happy with the project being complete and students being able to enjoy their summer time outdoors with friends and family.Â
