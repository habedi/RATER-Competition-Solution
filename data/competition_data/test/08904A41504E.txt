Dear Principal,

I think you should require all students to perform community service. I think this because community service is helpful to the community, rewarding to the student, and helpful to the world as a whole.

Community service is helpful to the community because it allows all members of the community to congregate and socialize while doing something beneficial for their selves. It is also helpful because the people would be making their society a better place. The people of that certain community will have an outstanding opportunity to make the place that they are living, what they would like it to be. Such things as volunteering, picking up trash, and donating can also help a community become a safer place and bring the people of that society closer together.

Requiring all students to do community service is very rewarding to us students because we will know that we have done something very special. Picking up a piece of trash may seem like a simple task, but it will actually feel rewarding to us because we would know that that one piece of trash has been eliminated from our community which has eliminated a small part of the nasty dirt and grime.

Community service is helpful to the world as a whole because it will make this earth a safer and cleaner place to be. Picking up trash is beneficial to us people, animals, and plants. Donating things such as clothes or food are very beneficial to those people who cannot afford those items and who are homeless. Community service can also sometimes fun; when people are having fun, they're a little bit more jolly and kind to people.

Everyone should do community service at some point because it doesn't take much time, and it is very rewarding. So please require all students to do community service if you want your world to be a better place.
