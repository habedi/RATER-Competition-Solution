To the principal at SCHOOL_NAME I would go with policy one because its better for us instead of turning it off when we come to school and cut it back on at 3:50. I say this because we can use it during lunch peroids and other free times like when you doing a project or when you need to use it for a stop watch or whatever the case maybe. Also it my be a emergency's i say this because probably your mother sick or your father or grandparents in the hospital and they had a heart attack. And they need to get in touch with you and your phone off during school so how you gone know what's going on with them would i advice my principal to go with policy one for a reason it my be a emergency's or your family going through things and its very important and you don't want to talk about you don't cause i know i be through things like this so i would want my principal to pick policy one cause you might be in them shoes like that so that's all i would say.
