"Hay Bob how were the try-outs for the basketball team?"

"The coach said i could've made the team, Joe."

"Why didn't you make it?'

"Because of my grades."

Too bad Bob couldn't make the team. He is so good in basketball but because of his

C he can't be on the team. Now how does that sound principal? He has so much talent and could lead your school to their first championship ever, but he has a C. Bob could have either was missing his assignments because he was having some family problems at home, or just not getting enough sleep. Mostly everybody has a C at school so who's going to be on the team.

Why allow students with C averages to participate in sports or other activities you ask?

Students are not going to be on the top of their class everyday. Even an A students slips up eventually, and if that student is in a club or on a sports team then they will be kicked off. How does that sound an a student messes up one time and gets kicked out of a sports team or activities.

In conlusion, a student with a C average doesn't mean that they are not smart. Maybe they are just struggling in one subject. When you allow kids with a C average to participate rthe sports team will win more.

Having a C is what most students have anyway so why not allow it?
