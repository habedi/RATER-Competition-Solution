A Car Free Future?

Is the car necessary in the 21st Century? Many city planners and government officals around the globe dont think so. Car free days are becoming common place in Europe and South America, and in the German town of Freiburg, an upscale neighborhood where cars are banned, has been a kind of experiment for larger towns and cities without cars. In Paris smog levels have gotten so high, that people have been asked not to drive their cars, in order to reduce pollution levels.

In the United States, the number of miles driven peaked in 2005, but has dropped nine percent since then. This is largely due to the 2008 recession, but also due to more people becoming educated about the effects that cars have on the environment. More people are choosing to take public transport, or carpool, because mainly it's cheap, and it's good for the environment.

Many key sociologists believe that this trend will continue. One of those sociologists is Professor Mimi Sheller, Diector of the Mobilities Research and Policy center at Drexel University. "Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift" there are many factors that point to the "major cultural shift" that Proffesor Shelley referred to. For example,the renewal of city centers has made the suburbs seem less appealing, and has drawn many people into the cities. Many carpooling apps have appeared in the last 2 years.

Better cities, more public transport, and an increase in telecommunications is the start of a global movement to reduce pollution and increase efficiency. the age of the car is coming to an end.
