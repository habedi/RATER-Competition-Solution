To play sports you needed a grade B average, but the deal is that many students have a grade C average. To benign up those grade will take time. It maybe even cause teachers to teach after school and work no pay for that time. Just for kids to play sports in school.

Some people like students can have stuff after and can't make up work in school that they need to play sport. So do the teachers have family to take care of. But some can say so what may be the student should do work in class. Well that is right but stuff might happen and family matters happen like you grandma died.

This can have more effects on other people instead my point of view. But my point is that others can be lazy and don't for thing. Therefore i think its a bad idea to kids in this way
