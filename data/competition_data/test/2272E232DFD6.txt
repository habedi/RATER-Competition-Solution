Many teachers offer summer projects to ensure that their students will be productive over their break. There has been a lot of controversy on if students should be the ones to create the summer assignments or if teachers should create them. Summer projects can be a great benefit for students next years in school, with this said teachers should be the ones to make the summer projects because, they have more knowledge on the information they hand out and it would make it easier for them to grade. Having teachers make the summer assignments not only benefits the teacher but it also benefits the student.

Summer projects are important to have, it would be best if they were created by someone who would have a lot of knowledge on the topic of the project, which would be a teacher. If students were to create the projects they wouldn't know what to make it about, students arent as educated as teachers are. Teachers have the benefit of the doubt because they know what they need their students to learn. A project wouldn't be very helpful if it was made by someone who didn't know much about what the project was on. Having experience and knowledge with a topic is very important when it comes to making a project.

Summer projects should be created by teachers because they have more knowledge and its easier for teachers to grade then students. Grades are very important to many students lives and they will do anything to see a "A" on there report card. With this said students shouldn't be the ones to create their summer assignments because, they would make it really easy just to get a good grade. Summer projects shouldn't be made just to get a good grade, they should be made to help you understand and remember the things you learned from the past year. Having teachers create summer projects is the best option because they wouldn't make it easy just so the class could get a good grade, they would make it so it benefit each of the students. This would also benefit the teacher because it would make it easier for them to grade each project since they made the project themselves and understand the topic.

With all of the different controversy on if students should be the ones who make the summer projects or if teachers should be the one, teachers are the best choice. Teachers do have a lot of good evidence to why they should be the project designers but, students wouldnt be a bad option either. Students have a bunch of free time over the summer compared to teachers where they might take on another job and be busy with that. With students having a bunch of free time over their summer break they can have more time to make and work on their summer projects. If summer assignments were created by the student it could benefit the student more because, they know what they need to still learn or review. Although, students have good reasons to why they should be the projects designers, teachers are still the best fit for the position.

Some schools require summer assignments and some schools don't but if there was a option if students should create the assignments of if teachers should, teachers would be the best choice. Teachers have the most knowledge on the topics they want to teach and they would be able to grade more efficient. Summer projects are meant to be beneficial to not only the student but to the teachers too. With teachers being the project designer they can make sure the project is high quality with information that will benefit each student. Therefore, summer projects should be made by teachers.
