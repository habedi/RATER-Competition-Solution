If you were Luke Bombeger why woud you join in the UNRRA program? Iis it because you get to go around the world and help different types of people who servived World War II, or is it because you get to take care of animals. If I were in

Lukes place I would join the program because of both reason s taking care of people who servived and because of taking care of animals.

In the first paragraph it says "Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part -time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which ment he could be drafted for military service.

It took about two weekes to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, but not for all the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luck served as a nigt watchman. It may hav ook Luck a long time to go around the Atlantic Ocean for two weekes it was worth it because he helped people in need of food and ofter supplies to stay alive. I would have done the same too because you never know if there would be a

World War III(WWIII).
