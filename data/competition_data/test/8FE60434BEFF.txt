Students most participate

Student should be able to make decisions. Some of the student don't like doing sports, or working of Oder students. That why teachers should not tell student what to do. These is why many students dont like doing sports because teachers forts students to do a sport . Because the teachers think that students do better in school when they start doing a sport. That it does not help, Many students don't do sports and they get good grades.

It well make the students don't want to go to school because they have to do a sport. If that happen, it well not be good for the school. Because many students well move from the school and go to a def rent school. The school they wold not have any students. It will make the teachers don't want to tech because they don't have many students to tech. If that happen the school well not have no one to work as a teacher. If all the students help of the yearbook it well be no point of potting the yearbook for sale . Because all of the students that help of the yearbook they have at ready know what the yearbook looked like. So it's point lest because the students well tell dear parents what the yearbook looks like. And not many parent well want to buy the yearbook because dear kids are going to tell dare parents what the yearbook looks like. and they well have no profit if the parents buy the year book is going to be because they want the yearbook are a memory . If teachers let students, do a sport de should let the Oder students. Have fun in school because if the Oder students have fun in sports let the Oder students have fun in school because some students love school. And if you make students do something they don't like the students. Are not going to like school and that is going to be one of the problems . And the students that like school they are going to hate school and the teachers. are going to a affected by the students because a teacher is going to say something to the student and the student is not going to care. And the teacher is going to start crying because the students don't care about nothing.

Generic_Name the school is going to be out of students. And de are going to have no teachears that can work for the school because teachers are scare of the student because the students don't care.
