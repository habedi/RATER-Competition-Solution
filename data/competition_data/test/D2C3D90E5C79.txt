Do you think the use of technology to read the emotional ecpressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I think it is valuable and im going to tell you why.

I think its valuable because in the first paragraph it says that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2npercent angry. If you exactly how someone felt then you would what to say and what not to say at a centain time. The person might be having a horrible day and you can say something that might make the even more made the they already are, and they could by chance of going off on you. That my start a fight or even worse you can by chance get expelled from school.

Another reason why i think its valuable is because, as it says in paragraph 5, you can probably teel how a friend is feeling simply by look at there face. You amy not be able to see exactly how there felling but you can kind of get the feeling on how there feeling. Most peeople like me personaly feeds off of there vibe and how there body language is.

This is why I think that it is valuable. If you dont like it then give your opinion just like i did. You may have different and better facts but everyone thinks different . So let me hear why you may or may not like it.
