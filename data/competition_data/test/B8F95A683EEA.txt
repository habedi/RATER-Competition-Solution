Dear principal

What you are doing with the kids that have an A or a B is fair for them to do sports. I think that you should let the other students that have a C

the opportunity to do sports because they might try to do better when they are in the sport. They are going to think that if they are not in the tem they are going to get kicked out and they are going to feel like they don't have any friends. This is what i think you should do and plus if you have more people on the sports they the school is going to make more money and are going to be able to buy more things, and more food for the students. If the students that have a C are not improving on their grades, they are going to get a punishment on the team and that will help them . I think that this is a better idea for the school and for the students that have C. Many students are going to like this new idea and they might all improve in more things.
