The earth as you know it is where us humans live and we have been living their for many many decades. The thought of going somewhere far away from earth sounds frightening,and unbelievable,but it may not be as unbelievable as you think. The author tells us Venus is the second planet from our sun and Earth, Venus, and Mars are all "neighbors" but all these planets have differences. These differences could lead us to something new or something that us humans have yet to discover.

The author supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The authour states "Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." The author is not declining the idea of studying venus but rather suggesting us readers that it is not dangerous to study venus. The author also states "Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into manly equally intimidating endeavors." He/She believes venus could point us into a new direction and it is worthy enough to study even if it means facing danger us humans have not yet expierenced.

We do not know what will become of us humans in the near future but rather of thinking that way we should focus on what we have here and what we have around us. Although at this current moment we do not have sufficent materials to study venus that should not stop us from exploring furthur into venus and/or studying it.

"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." This quote provides a new outlook of what is to come and it shows that the author definitley supports the idea of studying venus despite all the dangers it could come with.
