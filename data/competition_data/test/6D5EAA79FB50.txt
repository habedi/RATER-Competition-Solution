A large amount of our lives as humans in an arguably thriving environment is spent moving from point A to point B; whether it be by car to go to work, bus to go to school in, or a bike to go to a friend's house. So much time is wasted trying to get to somewhere many do not even wish to go to in the first place, but the main focus of this disgruntled movement is schooling. Kids, teenagers, and college students are expected to dedicate a greater amount of their day traveling and attending a school that they are uncomfortable being in, whether it be the social pressure, time crunches to get there in the first place, or even the constriction to make their own decisions that is heaved onto them the moment that they entered kindergarten.

From the first time you step into the threshold of a kindergarten classroom, you have begun weaving your tale of how you react to societal expectations of society, many embrace it, but many do not. And as you grow up, you may take to talking to people as easy, or maybe you do not. But one thing is for certain, meeting and being in close proximity with other people against your will is going to be claustrophobic for people who are not good in social environments. But if said people were given the option to take their mandatory classes online where they do not have to stress over the daily goings on and drama of in real life school, they could focus more on their studies. It allows them to take their time finishing questions and answering prompts if they were allowed to simply take a moment and breathe without a teacher or student waiting impatiently for their answer. Though the waiting doesn't just end with people.

Waiting is a chore, driving is a chore, packing yourself into a crowded bus is a chore, and yet you have to do it everyday. Disgruntled muttering under your breath as someone in the car in front of you makes a weird move, huffing to yourself as someone keeps looking at you on the bus, it's all a pain. But, what if you had a choice whether or not you can go to work or school physically? Online schooling is objectively convenient. Both teacher and student may record or voice chat lessons on their own times instead of standard locked in blocks, and they can keep the time they would have wasted going to a specific physical location at a specific time. It makes life easier, and asking a question for either party is a hop, skip, and an email away. Technology has come a long way, and it is time to embrace it for its true potential. There's a lot to learn from technology, and it doesn't end at just the educational requirements given by the school district.

Responsibility is hard to teach to a child and hard to enforce as an adult, even when that adult is yourself. Online education can very easily teach a child, teenager, or adult the consequences of taking it easy. While the lax social construct that distance learning offers is addictive, it is and will not be tolerated as a crutch for people who are lazy. Distance education still has homework, still has time crunches, and still is as difficult educational wise as real life schools. And anyone who does not treat distanced education as seriously as they treat real school, they are in for a rude awakening. If someone has not been taught responsibility, online education will teach them that real quick as students must learn time management to survive with a good grade. And though it may seem daunting, those who put in the effort to learn what schedule will work and what will not will learn responsibility that will carry with them into adulthood or the workforce if they already are an adult. The downsides of online classes are only made if the student and/or teacher are not doing their jobs.

Sure, you will learn responsibility as a student in regular schooling at a fixed location with pre-prepared schedules made for everyone. Sure, you may find social interaction easy and don't see the need in doing something online that you can easily do in real life. And sure, you may not care about the drive back and forth to school. But, those with these thoughts forget about efficiency. Holding a student's hand through already setting up their schedules and times will teach them some semblance of responsibility, but having that student make their own and learn through trial and error will result in a faster evolution of it. Some people do not mind going to school or don't mind the crowds, but there are people who cannot stand the claustrophobia or the eyes that go on them the moment they enter the school. And the amount of gas, time, and money that goes into transportation simply does not keep up the the 0 amount of dollars spent moving from the null point A to point B online education offers. Online education is the way of the future, and it is time to embrace it rather than chastise it for not being traditional.
