Dear Principle ...

I think that policy one is a better policy than the second one. If policy two was a rule, then students wouldn't care, they would still use their phones during classes and they wouldn't turn off their phones, but if policy one was a rule than they would probably follow the rules instead of using the phones when class is in session.

Students would be able to use their phones if they need to contact their parents and or guardian. This is why the you should allow students to have their phones during lunch and free time as long as the phones are off during class periods. When ever an adult says to do something, it seems as if the kid does opposite of what they tell them. So if you make number two a policy, students might choose to do the opposite of that rule.

Now i know that you would rather want to have phones off during school hours instead of having students having their phones out at all. If they were to follow policy one, life in school would be a much better way to contact people we need to contact. So all that I'm saying is that we would love it if policy one was the new phone policy.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
