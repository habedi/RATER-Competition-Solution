The new age of technology demands something refreshing and new every day,with new cellular phones coming out nearly every six months, such things are expected. However people who enjoy driving as a sport or even a pasttime are not going to be able to enjoy such things with cars that can drive themselves and the inevitability that roads will be a collective of such things. If they can make special roads; like how General Motors created a concept car that could run on track charged with an electrical cable, there should be an on/off switch for this kind of driving as well as things that are restricted to human drivers only. These things will create a kind of harmony between the two groups of people.

However if this alternitive can't be met then self-driving cars should be eradicated as an idea until it is completely safe. To many dangers are posed if we mix the kinds of cars anyway,all it takes is one person to create a wreck, And such things should be avoided at any chance given. Nobody needs to danger more lives than humans do on the highway. We could always put money into better things.

The joy of driving is to great for alot of people to give up driving on a daily basis. Our future isn't looking so bright except for the flourescent lights from the robots who are now part of our daily lives.
