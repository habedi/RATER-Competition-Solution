dear, senators of USA. in the manner of arguing i say that you should change to popular voting. you should change it because we (the people) know if somebody will make a good president. the people want to vote for somebody from how they look. for how someone would run our country. sure some people would want to change and go by the electoral voting. but the popular voting is they way to go.

when the people vote for a president, they don't want to vote for an elector to vote for a president. they would want to actually vote for the president, not an elector! Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral votes on him (said in source 3, paragraph 18). most of the congress wanted him to be a president. not many people (citizens) wanted him. but not the congress, they all wanted him. and they always get what they want.

like it says in source 2, "the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." what this person says is true. this voting system has been going on for quite a while. from the 1960's even till now. maybe even further back. its time to change this system. its to old. it may work and all that. but its time for a change. it's also unfair. the own congress gets to choose who their president is? why not the people? they're the ones who are going to have to go by what he says. we have to go buy the prices, follow the rules, and do as we're told. why shouldn't we be the ones to vote for our president.
