You walk in to class one day and find out that your teacher or whom ever actually knows how you feel . Would it be strange, ackward or understandable? This latest innovation called Facial Action Coding System from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe is a software that can recognize human emotion. Human emotion is communicated non-verbally which can be interpreted by muscualr units.

Your sitting in a lecture confused but decide not to say anything but do not realize that your teacher knows how you feel because of this software. This software may help with a lot in a classroom from depression to confusion and even excitment .

Prof . Huang predicts " A classroom computer could recognize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored" ( D'Alto, 6). This software may be the best innovation for schools now that many counselors can only get so little of information from students.

As many will argue that this software may not be getting the right information but it has been tested and put to work by Phsychologist , such as Dr. Paul Eckman. "He has been able to classify six basic emotions-- Hapiness, suprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles" (D,Alto, 3). This just comes to state that this software is able to process human emotion by facial muscles and therefore it comes to tell your emotion by how you portray.

This just comes to conclusion that maybe this software can actually help schools improve on helping students in any circumstance. As teachers, there jobs are to make sure students are not confused but better yet understand the concept that was teached. I believe this software may do a lot and should be tested in schools.
