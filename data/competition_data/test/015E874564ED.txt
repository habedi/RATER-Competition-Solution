The use of the new technology that can read emotional expressions would be good in classrooms because if you are doing work on the computer yit can scan your face too see if you are bored or happy. For the first example it woild improve the way students worked or if they are having a bad day it could scan there face and show like happy/positive things on the screen. Antother example is it will improve everyones attitude and some people could change.

For the first example If classrooms had this technology kids might start doing their work and they wont feel bored because if the computer read there expression they could make the work they have on the computer fun by making it into a game or like showing postive quotes or just outgoing stuff in general. From my experince work does get boring on the computer if you are there for a long period of time so this technology could help improve how kids work.

Another example would be how any persons attitude could always change if they are just in a happier mood. If any student is having a bad day and they are working on the computer this technology could scan this persons face and make them happier by putting good stuff on the screen. It could also cange how they act so for example in paragraph 6 it says "if a student is confused or bored it cold modify the lesson and make it fun so they arnt confused or bored".

Those are some reasons why this technology could help out in classrooms it could improve the way students learn and help them if they are sad, in a bad mood, or anything else.
