Imagine doing something that you dont feel like doing. My school is making all students do an extracurricular activity. The problem is that people might have to go some were after school or people cant wake up so early in the morning just to do an activity. You also got homework and maybe you already have activity.

Homework is important because it can help you learn better and under stand some thing you didnt know. Homework can get easy because you do it so many time. Its so easy it takes less time to do it. If You have a project its important to do that. project are more points then homework and can give your grade a boost.

Activity are fun and is also practice to for like a sport. Sport activities are allot of hard work. All of that hard work can get you a successful job. An activity can make socil with people and make friends. Friends can help you with things like homework or if you are getting bullied.

an extra activity can mess you up and it hard to handl. Homework can get you smart and practiceing in activitys can get you good job. do good and you can do you goal in life.
