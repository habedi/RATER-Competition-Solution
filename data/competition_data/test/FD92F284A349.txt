Is distant learning for students to attend classes from home a good idea? Students would benefit from being able to do this. Students are able to relax and enjoy the comforts of their own home, there is more time for them to enjoy their lives at home, and they are not influenced or distracted by the other students. This would happen through the schools contact with home such as online or video conferencing. The students that are at school dont get the same beneficial experience that would be there at home.

Students are controlled by the rules and regulations of the school grounds. When students are learning from home they get to sit comfortable in their own walls. They get to decide when they can get to go to the restroom and when and where they can eat. There is no certain way you need to dress and there are no uniforms. It is a lot more easier for students to work in a familiar environment such as their home.

When being at school for all the hours that the students stay they miss out on that time to be at home. The students are able to stay at home with their families and spend quality time together. At home the students are more able to find their lives, after finishing the lesson students will have time to work on project or a hobby of their own. For the time that students are in school without assignment they have no objective but to sit there and wait to be told what to do, at home they are able to do something productive with that time. When students are at the school they come home from doing school work only for them to do more school work that was assigned for home, after this they only have but a few hours of daylight before the sun goes down and the day is over. After that full day of work the students are exhausted and did not have enough time to enjoy the day or their lives.

Being surrounded by so many people at a school can have a negative effect. The learning experienceÂ can be interrupted by the influence of other students and how they distract each other. Some students are intimidating to others so they feel as if they need to avoid them to feel safe. Peer pressure can lead to breaking the rules and missing out on the learning that is supposed to be held there. The students distract each other to have fun and laugh when they are missing out on the experience they need.

In summery, students would be able to have positive outcomes on education from at home learning. They would now be able to live a life of their own instead of just a life at the school. Some students claim that school is horrible and like a prison, they only see this because they spend all of their childhood in a school. An education is important but what is also important is students having their own lives beyond school reputation.
