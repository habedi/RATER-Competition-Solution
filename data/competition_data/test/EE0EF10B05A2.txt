yes i think it is good to have a emotion machine for students in school it cold possily help them and people around them to figure out what is going on are when they need to take a break are upset about something i think it would be useful in the long run. paragraph 6. the same technology can male computer-animated-faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. most human communication is non-verbal, including emotional communication. and it also is devolping a new way for humans to communicate but i think we should just be open and just be able to express yourself on your own its easy.

but it would be really nice to see a computer that can read emotions in school like i said it can help kids learn better and help teachers know what they are doing wrong or when they need bathroom breaks or a snack time. and in the long wrong it could help students become more succsesful and have alot more knowlodage as well. it could also become a distraction as well in a class room because the students maybe just want to abuse the computer when they are souposed to be doing there work intsted of trying to figure out peoples emotions. it is also really cool that the computer can read if you got a fake smile. and how they tell is the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and diffrient muscle, the risorius,to an expert, faces dont lie these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politaction ot celebirty is not being truthful at all.

but i think they shoud use this computer on celebirties and plotiactions to see if they stick to there word.
