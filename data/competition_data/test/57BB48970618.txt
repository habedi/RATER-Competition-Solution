Every student has expierienced that one teacher who tries to give homework over break. Most Students look forward to summer break due to the fact that they have waited all year to be let out of school and have fun. With those statements put out there some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. They want students to continue learning over the summer. Schools should allow students to decide what projects they have to do over the summer. Reasons for this include students have to complete these assignments so they should design them, these assignments should be something they enjoy, they know what they need practice on. Therefore, this paper will elaborate on why this is the correct way to go.

Students should be able to pick their assignments because they are the ones that are going to have to complete it. Yes, the teachers may assist the students in the proccess, but the student will be the one to complete the project ,and is expected for them to learn from it. Summer time for every student is supposed to be fun instead of being filled with work and stress. Yes, it is good for students to learn but, a break is for the student to relax because they have spent their entire school year working hard. A student should not have to spend their summer break doing school work because schools want them to learn more when school is done for the year. some might argue that only the teachers know what is best for the student becuase they teach them. However, if teachers were to decide what the students should complete the students may not try complete the assignments. Therefore, this may cause the students to not learn anything at all, and they will slowly become unmotivated.

Another important thing to remember is the students should be able to do something they enjoy. It should not feel like school all over again, these projects should allow them feel like they are still on a summer break. Meaning students should not be overloaded with work and they should be given enough time to complete it. keeping in mind that they may have other summer plans. Especially not to where the student feels like giving up and feel to tired to continue on with their learning goals. Some educators will bring up the fact that everything that is good is not always fun but, they should want students to enjoy the things they do. This will allow students to still be able to enjoy their vacation, and be able to relax. Students should not feel like they are being forced to learn therefore, teachers of all grade levels would agree that students learn better when they are having fun. These assignments can be made fun by making the projects group related, or the students being able to win cool prizes.

Lastly, the students know what they need help on the most, every individual student has diffrent learning abilities. Ever student has subjects that they struggle with and subjects that they are successful in. Therefore, the students should each be able to pick their own individual projects that will help them in the long run. If schools are suggesting that students still learn even after the year is over then, it is best that the teachers assist the students in what they pick but, they should let the students decide on their own. However many individuals would disagree and say the teacher knows best becauase she teaches the students but, this doesnt mean much because only that individual knows what they truly stuggle with and want to learn. Students should be able to choose whatever subject they desire as long as they can learn something from it. The schools should want their students to strive and be successful in every way possible even if that means they have to take their own path.

Overall, students should be able to take their own route when it comes to knowing whats best for them. Students should be considered more when it comes to learning. Students should be able to make their learning expierience fun, students know what they need help with, and students are the ones that have to complete these assignments. No student is the same, every individual has diffrent needs and some schools fail to understand that. There are always lots of ways to tackle issues when it comes to learning. It can be a good expierience for everyone if every individual is taken into consideration. The main goal is for every student to learn something over the summer, this can be achieved as long as students remain as the main priority.
