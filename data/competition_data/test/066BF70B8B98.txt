Do you like different activities? This one time I didn't want to participate in an activity. Even though you don't want to participate in the activity, it will still help you. Then other people will remember you in life. I agree with the principal's approach because it can help you later in life, it can get you more involved with great things, and it can possibly make you famous.

Participating in an extracurricular activity can help you later in life. It can help you because people would be there for you. More and more people will know you and help you out with the rest of your life. Basically what I'm saying is the more people know you the more it will help. Now that's how people know how bad you want help later in your life.

Another effect of participating in an extracurricular activity is it will get you more involved with different activities. Just like the second paragraph this is one is great too. When you get more involved its good for you because you meet different people and famous people. Thats how it can help you later in life. When you participate in an extracurricular activity, its almost like the start of a new adventure.

One more thing of participating in an extracurricular activity is that it can possibly make you famous. Now this is the best part of this adventure. How you can be famous from one thing just like that you ask? Well there are people watching you. You could be an National Football League star, a professional Newsreporter, or maybe the next President of the United States.

Now I think people should agree with the principal's new approach because you could be the changer of this world. Even though you think you don't want to, you can still try it and you just might like it. The best part of being famous you are the boss, and you could change the country forever possibly. All you have to do is try an extracurricular activity. Come on try it people try it. You will miss out if you don't get more involved. It's not too late to agree with the principal's approach.Â
