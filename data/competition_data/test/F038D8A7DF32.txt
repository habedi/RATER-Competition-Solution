Dear school principal,

I am writing to you to talk about the school policy about phones. I can see why you have considered the rule of not having phones at all and a lot of students don't like it and its because sometimes students don't get the same class as their friends and they want to talk to them or have something important to tell them, but where students brake the rule is when they go behind the teachers back and start texting there friends. I really don't think that's right because then your not really learning anything so then what would be the reason for attending school then.

The policy I'm going with would have to be policy two. Policy two sounds the fairest and most reasonable rule, because students are still going to bring phones either way and that's a fact now whether they get caught or not is another topic. Well anyways i think that rule is great because sometimes students finish work early or have nothing to do but sit there, so why not let them use there phone? But it would only be in free time and that means no rushing through work either so you can just use the phone. I think its fair also to get to use your phone in lunch or recess because we are in school for about eight hours a day. I believe that's a lot of time without talking to your friends, or having breaks, or just having fun. So why not let us text in lunch

I mean we have been in class for hours and doing our work so we deserve a reward or break. Lunch time is also our time to interact with friends so that would be one way we can communicate. What I'm trying to say is that if we don't use them in class, and we behave, we get to use our cell phones during lunch or free time. To me this policy sounds correct it doesn't interact, or interfere with the schools learning process, and even better the students can take this as a reward.

So as you can see this is what I believe would be fair and would be great for the students and for yourself because students wouldn't use their phone in class any more considering that they can use it in free time or lunch now. those are my reasons why my school should go with policy number two. I hope I have convinced you to pick this rule and I hope the students can go with their part of the deal. Thank you for your time and I hope I have gave you something to think about.

Sincerely,

Your student
