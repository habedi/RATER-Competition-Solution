The Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman, it is a man-made computer, in which it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Many would say that this new break in technology is useless, but there is more that meets the eye when it comes to the Facial Action Coding System. This coding system can read the emotional expressions of any student in a classroom! This is extreamly useful as it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, it will then modify the lesson to fit the needs of that student, and human communication is nonverbal so therfore the computers are trained to react like a human in any situation.

When a child is sitting in a classroom with many other students while the teacher is explaining a lesson plan, they might fall to boredom or simply be confused. Many students could say, that they have at one point or another felt overwhelmed by a certain lesson in their classroom. The Action Coding System can, as said by Dr. Huang, "..recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Imagine having a computer that would allow you to read into the emotion of a student. This device could be the greatest asset to any teacher. Many students will subside their emotion for the thought of being cast out by their peers for not understanding a lesson, now with the Action Coding System created a student will not feel the pressure of being discriminated against, and teachers have a reliable source of technology to make sure their classrooms are being used to the best of their ability.

As well, the Action Coding System not only can scan a student's emotions, but when it finds a student confused or bored, it will modify the lesson for the child. As said by Dr, Huang, "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This piece of technology can even modify a lesson plan for a child struggeling to understand the curriculum or a student who struggles with ADHD. A teacher with this device could always know what is happeing in her class and how his/her students are feeling. In a sense, the teacher can have a weight lifted off their soldiers as he/she knows all students are taken care of.

Finally, the Action Coding System is wired to run like an actual human being. Therefore, since humans are mostly nonverbal, the system will produce in the same way. Dr. Huang said, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, So computers need to understand that, too."The computers will work in the same sense as an actual human. In a classroom, the students and teacher will feel as if they are being cared for by an actual human other than a piece of metal and plastic. This is a key attribute in the foundation of the product, as it is better to have a new technology that acts like a human, rather then a robot that tries to contol.

In conclusion, the Action Coding System is a must have in any classroom. It can recogzine when a student is becoming confused or bored, it can then modify the lesson, and it runs functionally like a human being. This piece of technology is universal and has a vivid array of uses.
