Do beleive in life on Mars? Many people do, they beleive that there is evidence to back up their theory. Such as the photograph, that was originally taken in 1976, of a rock that supposedly looks like a face. Though scientists know that the "face" is only a natural landform on Mars such as a rock.

The rock was photographed three times, in a place on Mars called Cydonia, the photgraphings were in , 1976, 1998, and 2001. Each time that picutre was taken it became more clear revealing that the "face" is simply a rock with many shadows. The shadows make the rock look like a face giving and illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth.

The photo was released to the public in 1976. This lead many people to believe that there really was life on mars. Many conspiracy theories formed. People believed now more than ever that life exsisted on Mars. Scientists knew this was false, it was merely a mesa, or rock.

Another photo was taken above Cydonia in 1998. This photo was taken by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) unlike that of the 1976 photo which was taken by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. This photo was ten times sharper than the original one. The picture provided even more evidence that "face"

was nothing more than a natural landform.

Though not eveyone was satisfied because the photo had been taken during a cloudy time on Mars. People believed that alein markings were hidden behind the cloudy haziness of the planet. Therefore in the summer of 2001 the MGS snapped another photo of the "face". The camera could capture pyramids, small shacks, or airplanes because the image could capture objects 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

The image revelad no such evidence that life once occured on Mars.

Many people might still be skeptical of the "face", but there is not enough evidnece to back up life on Mars. The "face" is just another conspiracy of life. Scientists know that the "face" is only a rock, or other natural landfrom on mars.
