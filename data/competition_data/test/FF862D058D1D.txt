I think that students should be required to do some community service projects because if little kids can do im sure bigger kids and adults can do it faster and in less time. For example adults can clean up in places that little kids are not allowed to go like on highways and unsafe streets and older kids can clean up during school or when they are home in there neighborhood and plus it benefits the environment deeply. Also they can volunteer at big events to clean up other times kids try to pick up trash in unsafe areas such as unsafe streets and buildings.

Another reason is as civilization gets bigger wildlife gets smaller and smaller by the day trash on the streets gets bigger to. In some places most people recycle to have a more safer world like in Hati millions of people died in the earthquake measuring about 7.5 last year many nations are still helping to try to clean it up and i the process they have invented new ways to stay healthy i don't know that's my opinion. hope you read this.
