First as a scientific NASA scientist i would explain that there is no life at the planet mars and the pictures tooken by the advanced camera showed proof that there is no life forms, but an illusion caused by the planets shadows, that formed a human shaped face in which made citizens of earth wondering is there life on mars, but this is just something that happens on the planet earth in comparision to mars.

Then for example that mars couldn't be created by aliens for example there are many illusional landforms are common around the American West including placeS like Idaho, and etc. It also included historical times when the same thing happened when unusual shadows that made it look like an Eygptian Pharaoh in Cydonia.

In conclusion there is no life on earth and that it is just shadows that was shaping into a human face, which can be similar to illusions on Earth, and was given proof that the faces were just landforms by technology.
