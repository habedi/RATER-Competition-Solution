Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have been informed that you like the idea of community service.

I also think it is a good deed and does help our city in may ways.

I have in the past performed community service and i did enjoy it. it has been brought to my attention that you would like all student to be required to perform community service.

I believe this is a very good idea and that this can help kids have more pride of their community.

Some of my fellow classmates do not think community service would be good.

They believe this would take away some of their time to do things they want to do.

This may be true, but a little time for community service wouldn't hurt anyone.

Also, community service can vary in different ways.

Some forms can be tutoring or teaching, and other can be cleaning or picking up litter and even volunteering.

I do believe community service would be a good requirement for students. It could them out of trouble and could even help the people in our city.

I do believe however there should also be a small reward for their deeds. This could make kids want to help out more if they know there is a reward for their hard work.

Another benefit of community service is that it can help you in the future.

Volunteering can help you get into a better college or help you when applying for scholarships.

In conclusion, my opinion would be to require some form of community service, there are many rewards that come out of helping another person or your own city.

I find this would be a very rewarding idea, and volunteering could also help someone in there future. This idea is very good one and should be made a requirement for the years to come.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
