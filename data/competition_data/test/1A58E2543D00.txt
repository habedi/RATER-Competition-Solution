I concur to not letting students participate in sports if their average is under a B. If they have below a B, their after school hours shouldn't be devoted to something that won't aid them educationally. Also, if a student has an average below B, it's possible that they aren't good at focusing, which would be a problem in any sort of sport. Above all of that, if a student cannot participate in a sport for having a below B average, it'll encourage them to bring their grade up so that they can participate in a sport.

Like I said at first, after school hours shouldn't be wasted on a sport if the student is doing poorly in school. That time could be spent studying for a test or completing homework, which the student would benefit from educationally. How many times have you heard the excuse of "I had basketball/football/softball practice," for incomplete homework? Now the grade they get for the homework will lower their grade, but if they had been doing it instead of practicing, their grade would have likely gone up.

Sometimes, the reason a student's grade is low is because, try as they might, they simply do not comprehend the material. But in other cases, the student may be the type to become easily distracted, so they cannot focus when the material is being taught. If they were out on the football field or the soccer field and they were distracted, it could result in an injury of some sort. Therefore, a student should be able to focus well in order to be allowed to take part in any sort of sport.

Have you ever heard the saying, "Wanting it is half the fun?" This is quite true. If a student desperately wants to participate in a sport, yet they have a C average, what do you think they're going to do? They're going to endeavor to bring their average up to at least a B, naturally. If every student got their average up because they wanted to partake in a sport, that would reflect on the school as well as the teachers in a very positive way.

To conclude, I strongly believe that a student should have at least a B average in order to be in a sport. It shows that they're capable of both completing assignments and practicing for said sport. More importantly, if they're able to focus well in class, they'll certainly be able to focus well out on the field or the court, and that'll make them a more valuable player. Last but not least, because they'll want to be in the sport, many students will likely boost their grades in order to be able to do so, which, in turn, will boost the entire school's overall performance.
