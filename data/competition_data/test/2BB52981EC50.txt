Dear congress, 1. I belive that everything you guys do is amazing. Except onr thing, the Elecotoral college. In my opionion having one is just a waste of time, money and effort. Why spend money on Electores when you can just spend that money on anything else, you could let the people of the U.S decide thatb for themselfs. Accoring to a artical i read about the year 2000 , 60% of voters would rather have a direct election from popluar vote then to have the Electoral college (source #2).I f more then half of the U.S popluation(which is in the millions)wants there to be no electoral college and have the president win due to popular vote, then what are we waiting for?

2. Think about it, if the people where the ones to pick the u. s president they would choose someone that they think would be best for the country. There might not be any conflict in the white house about who picked who , because they didnt choose anyone. The electoral college consist of 538 members each state having more or less depending how big there state is,for exampel texas would have more then ohio since its much larger. or florida aving more then new york ect......

A majority of 270 electoral votes most be given to a party for that president to win.

3. In conclusion, i think that a electoral college is use less and they should let the people decide on their president.    Â
