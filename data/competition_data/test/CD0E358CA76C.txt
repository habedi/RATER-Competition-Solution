During school, students are constantly testing their knowledge by learning new things, but throughout summer break when school is not in session, students often forget what they were taught during the school year. Most projects assigned to students are teacher-designed, even though a student-designed project would be more beneficial towards their education.

Although a teacher-designed summer project serves as a guideline for topics the student should focus on, student-designed summer projects are more efficient because they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allows the student to work at their own pace without stress.

When learning something new, creativity plays a significant part in success. Students who apply their creativity to a project are more likely to enjoy and learn from their assignment rather than those who choose not to. For example, if a student was given a writing assignment and allowed to write whatever they desire, the student's interest would spark and their creativity would show. Another example is if students worked on project in groups; The group members would be allowed to combine their creativity to create a successful piece.

Decision-making is a key component to life, therefore students should be allowed to make their own decisions when it comes to creating a project. For example, if a student was asked to do a book report by their English teacher, the student should be allowed to decide how they would like to present. This method helps the student learn because they are incorporating their own methods and decisions. By doing this, the student is incorporating their learning capabilities into a work of their own, thus allowing them to successfully learn the topic.

Learning at another's pace rather than oneself is an inefficient way to learn new information. Therefore, a teacher incorporating their way of working into a project is unacceptable for a student's learning process. For example, a student who is given homework should be able to complete it without a deadline because the student would be working at their own pace and learn from what they are practicing rather than stressing about the deadline. Also, when stress is involved in learning, students are less likely to complete their assigments because they will have anxiety attempting to start.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are more efficient beacuse they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allow the student to work at their own pace to prevent stress. Teachers should allow students to design their own projects because it motivates them to learn how they want to learn. If teacher-designed projects continue to be incorporated, students will be less likely to complete their projects while learning new topics.Â
