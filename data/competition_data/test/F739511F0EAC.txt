Do you think students should do extracurricular activities? I disagree with this because some students might not have time for activities also some students might not be into it,or some students havent done activities before. Some students enjoy doing activities while some students dont like it at all or some students have not tried doing activities before. Do you think all students have to do actives?

First,Not everyone likes doing actives some students prefer to stay home or go out with family or friends. Students can be very busy by doing homework or projects for classes. Students wont have time to do activities if there busy by doing homework and projects. If they do actives they will get stress and wont be able to spend time with family or friends. Everyone should at least spend time with family. For example,some students dont spend a lot of time with family and if they do activities they wont ever spend quality time with family or wont be able to go out.

Next, Some students might not be into activities. Some students haven't tried doing activities and are scared to do it for example, like sports you can get hurt or break a bone or something. Some students dont like doing activities as much like others do. Some students dont find it entertainment for them and others do and its okay everyone is different. The principal cant make students do something if they dont like it or haven't tried it before in there life.

In conclusion,I dont agree that all the students have to do extracurricular activities if they dont want to or don't like it and the principal cant make them do it either. Everyone can decide for themself and pick what they want to do. Everyone can dislike it or like it its up to them. The principal doesnt have to make them.
