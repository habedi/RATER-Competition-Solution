The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to have in a classroom. This is a great idea because if a student is lost or confused about the class or work they're doing, this computer detects it and the teacher would help. In the other hand I think most people would not like this idea because this computer would know everything and how a person might be feeling, not everybody likes to tell people what they feel at the moment. The Facial Action Coding System can be the same technology to make computer-animated faces more expressive, for video games and video surgery. Also humman communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Meanwhile they also use muscles to show espression. Sometimes teachers know how you feel if they know you for a while the face expressions they make. Some people just don't even make expressions they always have a serious face on and people that you have known for a long time such as friends, familiy ect. You know them and if something is wrong you will let them know. This computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Also a cool idea to see how the students feel thst day for class, everyone shpuld be happy. The theory of emotion moving your facial mucsles not only expresses emotions.
