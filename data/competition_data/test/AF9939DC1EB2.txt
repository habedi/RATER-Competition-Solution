Many people want an education that is accessible to all types of students. Some schools are starting to offer online classes and video conferencing for students to get their education from home. More schools should start offering online courses because of students with severe social anxiety, students who get an extreme illness, and for students with gifted athleticism who need to devote most of their time to their sport.

Plenty of students have social anxiety but for some it comes worse than others. Some students walk alone in the halls because they just want to get from one class to the next with no interruptions, however, there are also students who do not choose to do walk alone because it comforts them. Social anxiety takes over their ability to want to talk to people and try and make new friends because of the fear of being judged or not accepted. With online courses they do not have to feel that sense of loneliness during school. They will be able to focus better and not have a constant fear of another student looking at them and making fun of them, they would not have to be scared of going to lunch and sitting alone, and their mind would be more clear from stress distracting them from their education. Students will be getting the same knowledge from an online course as in a physical school and they might be able to excel more than they would be in a classroom because of how comfortable they feel in their learning environment.

There are also ways to get kids who like interacting with people to still enjoy an online course. Students who get extremely ill and have to be out of school for a majority of the year but still love the face to face interaction with people can set up video conferences with teachers and get their education just as well as others. This is a great opportunity for students to stay on track with school when they are not able to attend school in a physical classroom. If schools do not offers these types of programs the school system would just be letting kids fall behind when they have no choice. No students want to stay back another year because they were got an extreme sickness. These video conferences and online courses can be the way to success for sickly students who need the little bit of extra help.

The one thing a student athlete could want is a little bit of help. Student athletes are working two lives, their school life, and their sports life. It is a completely different world for them and when it gets to the extreme some of them have no choice but to devote their whole life to their sport. Online courses might be their way to get the best of both worlds. Super athletes at a young age are offered a position on a professional team and asked to change their life so suddenly. They are not going to be regular kids anymore after that. The excitement builds up inside of them and they will take the great opportunity without even thinking of the consequences. If they get a career ending injury they will be done. Thinking their whole life is set for them to play a professional sport, thinking they do not need school anymore but as soon as reality hits them it is instant regret. Young athletes need to be prepared for the "What if" situation. Online courses can help them be prepared for these moments. They can fit an online course better into their schedule than going to a classroom for 8 hours of their day and still be getting an education. Most of a professional athletes day is training and recovery for the next day. Being able to spread out their classes and finding when it is most convenient for them to take online classes during the day would be a lifeline for young athletes. Playing a professional sport while being a teenager means giving up their normal teenage life but it does not have to mean giving up their education.

Some people may say online education would be too easy for kids and they need to be challenged in a classroom. At the end of the day an education is an education. Students can take that as seriously as they want to whether they are in a classroom, taking an online course, or having a video conference. The environment a student learns in is so crucial to the way they will be able to pass their classes to their best ability. More schools should start offering online courses and video conferences because of kids who struggle with social anxiety, students who get an extreme illness, and gifted student athletes who have to devote most of their time to their sport.
