Dear TEACHER_NAME i really do think that kids of SCHOOL_NAME of excellence should do community service because. every one lives here like me and my mom we all ways keep our front an back yard clean. like some kids walk around eating .when they get done eating they throw it right on the ground. so every were you look there stuff on the ground paper-chips bags and more every day there more an more you can not go out side with out seeing garbage on the floor there germs all around you an you could get rally sick if some germs get on you in it's really contagious you could catch a disease. that's one reason i think that should get together an clean up are communities. another reason i think we should keep are communities clean is if you fall or slip on something you could get right back up an dust it off . but if we don't keep are communities clean when we fall are clothes will be dirty in we will have germs on them. then who wants too come out there door with paper all in there yard most people wants too come out too a clean neighbor hood in smell the fresh air nothing and there yards . the last reason i think we should keep are community clean because if are president barrack obama comes in take a visit too Chicago he's going too want too go back too his home land because no ones wants too be in a stanky,dirty nieghbor hood. so that's why i think we should keep are nieghbor hood clean.
