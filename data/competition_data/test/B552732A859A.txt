I find that driverless cars is not only a bad idea but a bad advocate, I also find that this car is a bad avocate for not only teenagers but adults as well. Although the car does seem cool because it is something new doesn't mean it won't malfunction while being used at anytime. People would have to take extra procausion while using this type of car. I could see more accidents in the future rather than safe driving.

The main reason I find that driverless cars is a bad idea is because of drunk driving. Teens and adults already take full advantage of it so why wouldn't this car advocate more drunk driving? Not only on top of cars malfunctioning, you have to pay extra procausion, and plus on top of all that someone decides to drink and drive. People don't understand all of the responsiblities you have to take on while having a driverless car.

As to many teens they like to show off, a lot. That is something everyone likes to do, but imagine all the horrific things that driverless cars could cause. It only takes one person to get distracted by their cellphone or other passangers in the car. Something could happen to the car in just a short period of time, The car could malfunction but the driver responsible wouldn't know or they didn't have enough time to stop the car or give their attention to the road.

In my opinion I believe that driverless cars should be banned from every state. Driving isn't just about getting to your destiniation, but keeping drivers, passenger, and pedestrians safe. Only alert drivers would be in the proper state to drive one of these cars but teens and other drivers that aren't very alert and are already not safe drivers and could cause many problems.
