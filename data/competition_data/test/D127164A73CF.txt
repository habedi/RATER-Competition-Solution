Dear Principal,

I believe that the idea of not allowing students to participate in sports if they have lower grades is a good idea, however I believe that the required grade should be lower than a B.

Perhaps instead of having a B average students should be required to have a C average.

My reasoning behind this is that while a C is considered a bad grade it is not absolutely terrible.

A C grade is still a decent grade, although while not particularly good, and should still be acceptable.

Also you have to take into consideration that a majority of our schools students are averaging a C, which is below the proposed requirement level for sports and other recreational activities.

If this proposed policy is put in place it will severely hurt our athletic and extracurricular activities and what would the community think if suddenly more than half of our basketball, football, and choir dropped out?

And I don't even want to begin to think of how many angry phone calls we will get once the parents find out about this policy.

I believe that this is a good idea to motivate our students to do better in school, but also think that the required grade average is to high.

Like I stated earlier perhaps should consider making the proposed average a C.

This would still motivate kids to do better in school, as most of them are currently maintaining a C average and must watch their grade to make sure it doesn't drop below that.

Please consider my ideas and the ideas of my peers carefully before making your decision.

Thank you!

Respectfully,
