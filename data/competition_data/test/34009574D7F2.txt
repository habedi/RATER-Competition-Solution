Have you ever heard of high-resolution images and 3D altimetry? If you haven't, it is technology that helps us scientists here at NASA take a closer look at images from the Global surveyor. We have been doing this for quite a while now, and in 1976 we got our first picture of a "Face" on Mars. We call it the Face because it has formal structures that look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. We were very curious about this structure, so we decided to send the surveyor back to get another perspective. We got our second picture in 1998, which came out more clear and looked more like a face. In 2001 we went back for a final time, and we have concluded that this form that looks like a Face is nothing more that just a natural landform.

You may not believe me when I say this, but trust me, my job at NASA is not only performing tests, but also to put the results into a viewers' perspective. Around 40 years ago, we recieved a funny photo of what looked like a Face, however, technology wasn't too strong back then. With all the tools that we use today, we were able to hypothesize that the Face is just a Martian mesa. A martian mesa is a huge rock formation, it just so happens that this rock had shadows around it giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

To prove this hypothesis correct, we sent out the Mars Global Surveyor to snap pictures that were ten times sharper that the original photos taken of the Face. After observing these photos, we concluded that the Face is just a simple natural landform, and there was no life on Mars and no alien monument after all. Conspiracy theorists did not believe the tests as they were taken on a cold winter day, they said aliens may have been "hibernating". So again on April 8, 2001, we went back and took another shot. This time we were able to finally conclude once and for all, that the Face is nothing but nature on its own course.
