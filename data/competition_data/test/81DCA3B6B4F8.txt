In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" talks about the idea if Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author supports the idea by saying that Venus has been watched by NASA in the last three decades and they have kept failing every single time but have been improving their technology to be able to inhabit the "Evening Star". The author supports the claim by quoting "NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." The author is stating here that NASA has made progress in their work to be able to make a landing on Venus which is showing that he knows NASA is trying their best to visit our "sister planet." The atmospheric pressure of Venus is 90 percent than what we experience on earth. So the conditions that NASA is facing is far more extreme than anything humans ever encountered.

An example that shows how well the author supports the claim, in paragraph 8 quoting, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." The author is saying that nothing should stop humans from discovering Venus and being able to visit the planet, but is visiting Venus a safe thing to do and will it be accomplished? The author's idea is that it is possible to visit the planet if the technology gets better and advanced for space travel and it will limit the chances of any problems occuring with a single trip to Venus. There is a possibility that anytime in the future that space travel will be a reality esspecially with the progress NASA is making. The article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is supported by the idea of the author that Venus is worth of pursuit.
