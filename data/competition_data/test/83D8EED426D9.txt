The principal has decided that all students must participate in a after school activity. Should students stay after school for a after schoolÂ activity?

I think students should stay in after school activities, because to be active and heathly and if their alone at home and they got nothing to do.

They can choose activities like sports because it can help them developed new relationships and stay active and let out their high energy they have. They can do after school math or reading because some students are not able to have time to do their homework based on their personal life.

some students help in a subject that they dont understand or if they are missing work that they need to finish before the due date. other students can stay after school if their home alone and they got nothing to do at home or when they feel left out they can stay after school and do a activity and build confident on them self.

I think students should after school because it also helps them built confident and make them feel wanted also make them stay active and heathly and when they got nothing to do at home they can stay after school to be active. thats why i think the principal should let students do after school activities.
