Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think community service is good because for one it gives people to get out of the house and it can clean up the towns around the area. For two i think it will make the school noticeable to people that the school is the school that they want their kid to go to. and three it can be good for the students to make new friends.

The first reason was to get people out of the house and i think that today kids are really fat that is just me and if kids just went out they might just get fit and i think that they do not want to be fat all their life. so yes i think that you should make students do community services because it would be good for every one and every thing.

The second thing was that it would make the school stand out of all the other school around the area i think that because i don't think that other schools are doing that.

and i would make every one in the area say man my kid is in that school and make them proud the last reason is that maybe one other school is going to do it also so that i will to and then the kids can make new one so that they can enjoy doing it also.

so that is why i would like to say thank you for reading and i hope you make this school do community service.

Your friend, STUDENT_NAME
