I think the the principal is right. Did you know that the kids who do exercise activities learn faster and there brain can concentrate more. As a principal you are supposed to be looking out for the children and caring for their education. The reasons why I agree with the principal is because kids can get bored sometimes and have nothing to do, kids also need to stop being so lazy all the time, and maybe kids could find talents that they didnt even know about.

The first reason why I agree with the principal is because kids can get bored sometimes. If kids have nothing to do they can go play there basketball ball game that day or go practice outside. Instead of sitting on the couch all day watching TV they can go to chess club or any other clubs in there school. If they go do school activities they will get more exercise and can use there energy for more than just pressing buttons on a remote. For example I made b-team soccer and since I made it I get to spend with friends more and see my other family more.

The second reason why I agree with the principal is because kids now adays are very lazy. They dont listen and all they want to do is sit on the couch and watch TV or play video games. I love watching TV and playing video games but I still get up and go outside or go play with my brothers or sisters. Being lazy is not a good thing you will get no where in life if you are lazy all the time. I love going to my practices and spending time with family TV and video games are allways last in my life and maybe it should be for you to. And also doing school activities will allow you to spend more time with friends.

The third reason why I agree with the principal is because kids could finds talents that they didnt even know about. If you are lazy all the time you wont wont ever find out things about yourself. For example if you are one of those kids who are known as the kid in the corner and you dont ever try anything new you wont ever be able to acclompish your dreams. And also if ypu find out that you are really good at basketball or soccer you could one day maybe because a famous NBA or MLS player. If you found out that you are really good at something and you made really good money off of it you could give some to charity or to hospital or to churches. If you find a talent that your really good at you could inspire others to do the same.

Those were the reaons why I agreed with the pricipal. I hope me telling you all those things help you learn that lazyness is not the answer. I really hope that I inspired you to agree with the principal. So hopefully now you will get of the TV or video games and go spend time with family or go to some after school activities and enjoy the freedom you have because not everyone has that freedom.
