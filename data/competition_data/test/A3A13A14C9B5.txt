Dear Principal,

I believe that your policy in students having to maintain at least a B average to play sports is a good thing because for one it will encourage students to do good in school and in turn they get to play sports. Also in college you must have usually an A average to even get in to a good college so if students are us to setting goal on having good grades it will help them in the long run. Also some students think that sports will get them everywhere in life. How will they get into college without good grades and if they don't get into college then how will they get recruited? They wont so I think your policy will help a lot of students. Yes we might not win as many games as be the best but its not all about winning. Its about giving kids a better education so they can be successful in life. There is a study that people who went to college average 2 million dollars in their life more then someone who didn't go to college. So it is almost a fact that college will prepare someone for life and your sports policy will make it one step easier. Also i think students cant have below a C in conduct to play sports because if you can't behave i know i don't want you to represent my school. So most people won't. So all in all i think that your policy will help our school and help the kids that go here be more successful in life.

Thank you, STUDENT_NAME.
