Summertime is by far the most favored season among students. Students of all ages get to relax and not have to worry about what time the bus comes or what day their six-page lab report is due. Three months of no worries is something that anyone could dream for, and students are fortunate to get it every year. Some could even argue that summer is too short, considering that we only get three months of break compared to the nine months we are in school. Nevertheless, summer is a gift for all the hard work students put in all year. As great as summer may appear to be, there is sometimes a downside that is tied to school: summer projects and assignments. Usually, the words "summer" and "assignment" are not supposed to go in the same sentence; but in some instances, schools give assignments to students over the summer so they are not unprepared for the arrival of the next school year. These assignments are meant to be helpful rather than work to keep you busy. Most students think these assignments are not right to give, and prefer to design the projects themselves if they must have them. For many obvious reasons, students should not design their own summer projects, for it is the teachers that truly know what will better them as students.

Although student-designed summer projects may seem like an advantage to the student, it is very much the opposite. If a student designs something for themselves to be able to learn, they would not know what their supposed to do. With no real knowledge of the curriculum, how would a student be more well suited to create an assignment for themselves? Students need the teachers to set things up for them because they are the professionals that get paid to make these projects. The teacher will always know what is best for the student whether the student chooses to accept that or not. Summer projects are not always the most fun to do, but teachers construct them in order to benefit the student. Similar to the saying "mother knows best," teachers know what is best for the student. Summer assignments should result in gratefulness toward teachers rather than resentment; because it is those same teachers who give the assignments that care the most about the student's future and wants them to be challenged. The bigger picture of these assignments should be thought about rather than seeing them as absolute burdens. Just trust and believe in the process.

Next, if a student makes his/her own assignment, they would not push the limits of their own ability. In reality, if something could come easy rather than difficult for someone, the odds of taking the difficult path are slim to none. For example, a student is given the opportunity to write an essay on any topic they choose to. That may seem like an advantage to the student, but in reality is a disadvantage. The student will choose a subject that is very familiar to them because it is the safest to dive into. Doing what is easy defeats the whole purpose of what is supposed to strengthen a student. Teachers giving assignments is a more sensible concept because they know what will benefit the student. The whole purpose of assignments and projects being assigned rather than student-designed is to break students out of their comfort zone. Testing their abilities and seeing what they are capable of gives a better evaluation of the student. A student's willingness to work is crucial to their future as well as other aspects of life. Student-designed projects are not usually given because they do not display true capabilities. A task must be given to a student to determine their ability to go above and beyond.

Lastly, teacher-designed summer assignments give the student a better understanding of what to expect for the upcoming school year. To illustrate, a new student could newly enroll in the school after moving from another state. The standards compared from their old school to the new school are likely to be different, leaving the student oblivious to what they will endure. The summer assignment is a preview for the year, showing what the student should expect to experience throughout the duration of the year. Summer projects also refresh students to how school goes so they are not going into the new year unprepared. Every student, for the most part, comes back to school rusty after summer break. Handwriting is crooked, having to adjust to the new schedule, even forgetting the log-in and password to the computer. All of those things are expected because those things are taken out of the daily schedule that students endure. All of those things also make teacher-designed summer projects all the more effective as refreshment. Doing those projects get students back in the swing of things, as well as providing a head start for the new year.

To conclude, it is essential to students that their teachers design their summer projects. There are no real advantages to students designing their own summer assignments, whether students realize that or not. Teachers work everyday to better the education and future of their students; which means they know what is better for their students in the grand scheme of things. Although they may seem like a drag, summer assignments are meant to give a taste of what the new year will bring. A teacher would not give an assignment that provides no benefit to the student. Teachers are always a step ahead and know what is beneficial and not. Let them continue to do what they do best, which is help students go forward.
