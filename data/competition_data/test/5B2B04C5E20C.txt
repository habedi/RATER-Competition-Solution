Have you ever wondered why some kid dont do some sports or running for class president? Well there are a lot of reasons and i will be explaining some of them in this essay.

One reason why i disagree with extracurricular activities is because some activities can interfere with your plan. For example if you and your family have to go and the activity is also that day if you have to go the plans your family made will be ruined.

My second reason why i disagree with extracurricular activities is because most activity put a lot of stress on the students. The students will not have anytime to wind down from school and start stress about school work. to much stress on someone can cause them to have a heart attack. Which weakens the heart which also weakens them.

My third reason is that there are some shy people that don't even like being around people. they like to stay independent and then if people talk to them they start to get mad.

So my conclusion, to should students have to do extracurricular activities i disagree because it can stress the student to much, they could have plans for something.
