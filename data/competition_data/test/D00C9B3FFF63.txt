In the article, "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author, starts by talking about how Venus is part of our solar system and some facts about the planet. They try to support thier ideas on studying Venus as a worthy pursuit and dangers by first listing the similarities it has with our earth and then transitions toward thier topic. The author explains very well, many times by using examples and facts to support their idea about how Venus is a worthy pursuit in the scinece field, but at the same time they also counter with the many dangers that are eminent.

First, the author describes the dangers with facts and statistics about Venus and the amosphere and how dangerous and harmful it is. Like in paragraph three, they stated "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide" Which readers know is impossible for humans to survive under. Then they talk about the temperatures which is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author does a really good job at then comparing the temperature on Venus with the temperature on earth by telling us that is is over 90 times greater than what is experienced on earth. Comparing is an effect way of making readers understand the difference and especially when it shows the numbers written all out. Then, they continue to support thier cause by talking about frequent natural disaster that cause havoc which some already excist on earth. This makes Venus looks so much more harmful and uninhabitable than it already did.

Later in the passage, they transition to the benefits of studying about Venus and it is a somewhat smooth transition since the aurthor has already set up thier claim in paragraph two by stating plenty of similarities between the earth and Venus so readers can get and understanding of Venus. So in paragraph four, when the author entered, it was very smooth with a question on why the scientists even bothered and they countered by answering the question which helped support the authors overall claim. Another thing that shows how well the author has supported the idea of Venus worth studying is they list more similarities like in paragraph four they talk about how Venus had similar features like "valleys, mountains, and craters." This gave readers a sense of imagery and later supports the imagery and landscape by giving a reason of why that is important like it is out nearest option for travel. This make the author sound much more credible.

Finally, in the article, the author supports both of thier ideas by talking about NASA and thier ideas on the space travel. Paragraph five and six help explain why traveling to Venus is so hard, but still so worthwhile. They state, that it is diffcult by listing the extreme conditions even if they were to get close and still survive. Then in paragraph six they list the risks and the sample and different pictures they could have taken but the dangers were too high. This helps show readers the real limit and possiblity at the same time.

Therfore, the author throughly explains thier idea and supported it very well with different techniques and different ways of explanation. The author has already done very well in adressing how traveling to Venus had its advantages but getting there and actually surviving the dangers is very hard. They did very well in explaining the dangers with facts and statistics. Then later also explained throughly with claims and backup information. This shows that this author was very prepared and supported thier idea exquisitely.
