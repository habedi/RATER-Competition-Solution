Today I've been called to the NASA facility to discuss a certain topic. I am unaware of what this all about. As I enter the doors to the room where the meeting will take place, I see my fellow coworkers with the same confused expression. Our boss, who is usually quite loud, is unusually quiet, giving us the idea that this is very serious. As he clears his throat, everyone finds a seat and settles down. I take a seat in the back right corner so that I can see everyone expressions during the meeting.

"Hello," our boss says loudly, starting his speech, "and welcome. I apologize for this unexpected meeting. Trust me, I wasn't very thrilled to be here either. But I have gotten some unexpected images from Viking 1. It is very... strange. So without further adue...." He takes a remote like thing and turns on the projector, showing an image on the wall. As I look around the room from my corner, I see a number of expressions, some confused, some amused, some even a bit worried. But one expression stands out. A new guy, I'd say he's been here for about a few weeks, is two seats next to me, mumbling something under his breath. I give him a strange look. He seems frightened. As his mumbles get louder, more people start to stare. "Th-The aliens did this.. I... I know it!" The room bursts into laughter. I give a few chuckles as well. I mean, come on now. Aliens?

"Alright, alright. Settle down now. Have some respect. Let him give his point of view," the boss says. I guess he has a point. As the room gets quiet again, all the attention goes towards Mr. New Guy. He begins speaking. "You guys think it's funny, but think about it! If you think that in the WHOLE universe, we are the only form of life, you're ignorant."

Is this guy serious?

"Everyone knows that aliens are smart! They could've easily built that landform to mock humans!"

I can't take this nonsense anymore. I casually raise my hand, waiting for the majority to acknowledge it. When I feel that I've gotten enough peoples attention, I begin to talk. "Listen. I understand that we may not be the only life form in the universe, but do you really think that aliens built that? You said it yourself man. It's a landform. A natural landform." I slowly get up and make my way to the wall where the image is being displayed. "Do you see this?" I point the "eye" of the landform. "This is a shadow. Nothing more, nothing less. As well as this other "eye" and the rest of the darkness making it seem like this landform has a face. It's just the angle of Viking 1 and where it was when the picture was taken. It just so happens that it looks like a human face. Now I agree, it is kind of weird. But Viking 1 takes a lot of photos. Don't you think there would be at least a few pictures with aliens making it? Sorry man, but your theory just isn't adding up." There is a small appause as I walk back to my seat.

Mr. New Guy doesn't look very happy. He looks a bit relieved though. "Well," boss starts speaking, "I suppose we have our answer already. Just a simple landform. Alright guys. You all are dismissed. Have a nice night." He begins packing his things. I get up and head out. As I get in the car I sigh. "Well, that was a waste of time."
