dear state senator i think you should change to election by popular vote because its worked for us in the past no one can cheat on the voting. those are just some of the reasons we should change to election by popular vote  as a voting system.

first of all we should change to election by popular vote. because its the easiest way of voting because if we keep using the electoral college according to source 3 its un fair because states that are bigger get more attention than smaller states. and also source 2 says "its official the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality".

second of all election by popular vote is the fairest way of voting because unlike the electoral college tjhe popular vote would make the number of votes per state even so not on state gets more votes than another. according to source 3 "the number of electoral votes depends on the size of the state in which you live so the means if you live in a small state your state gets less electoral votes than a big state". and in the electoral college some people chaet and vote more than once giving that president an even bigger chance of winning.

the final reason i think we should change to the election by popular vote is its more efficient think about it would you want a voting method that depends on the size of your state i mean what if you lived in rhode island where you get 3 electoral votes versus texas which has 38 electoral votes but with the election by popular vote it counts which canidate has more votes and based on those numbers thats who gains presidency.

in a nut shell the reason we should use the election by popoular vote is its more efficient more fair and easier to decide whos president. so mr senate please read this and consider it i think theese are all very good reasons we should make the change.
