Suburban cities are buzzing with traffic; every person is trying to get some place as fast as possible. Whether it is a business meeting or their child's soccer practice, a car is the preferred transportation method. But there is a new initiative across the globe that is growing in popularity: the idea of living without cars. Several urban cities have participated in efforts to reduce the traffic in their home, because of the numerous harmful effects it has on the people and the earth. Three cities have subtracted cars out of their daily routine and reaped the benefits. The United States has also procured benefits because of the decline in car usage. In Vauban, Germany: citizens live without cars, in Paris, France: driving restrictions were placed to help control the pollution, and in Bogota, Colombia: an annual "Day Without Cars" is put into effect. These efforts have proven to have multiple advantages. The articles, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" and "The End of Car Culture" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, The United States and Vauban's unique situation is discussed. Robert Duffer explains Paris' predicament in his piece, "Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog." the final source is from Andrew Selsky, "Car Free Day is a Big Hit in Bogota." Limiting and abolishing the use of personal automobiles is helpful to the environment, the city, and the people.

When Paris, France is mentioned, people think of the Eiffel tower looming over their head. In reality, what is really dancing over their hair is smog. The classic city has experienced record high polution rates in the previous times. The government has decided to do something about their predicament. Duffer explains the measures they took, "On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." The efforts that the French made to prevent pollution proved to be extremely successful. Because of the strange weather conditions, the smog had become trapped in a layer of air, causing their smog count to rival Beijing's, the most polluted city in the world. Paris adjusted to the bans by making all public transportation free and making certain exceptions for hybrid cars and cars carrying three or more people, Duffer explained. Although some deliery companies were not happy with the restrictions on their driving, the smog drastically cleared enough for the city to abolish the ban and all numbered plates were allowed to drive after only a week of the ban.

In a new and revolutionary city, cars have actually been banned from the premises. Vauban lies in Germany, near the French and Swiss borders. Aside from main thoroughfare, the streets are primarily car free. And the locals think that it pays off, "'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way', said Heidrun Walter." The motives behind this are due to the harmful greenhouse gas emission from so many cars. Rosenthal cites the statistic that, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas in Europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States." With car-less cities like Vauban, the greenhouse gas emissions are close to nothing. Citizens walk, bike, or pile on the bus. This method helps protect the environment and have people enjoy their daily lives a bit more. In Rosenthal's other article, about Car Culture, she explains how the car industry is declining anyway, and how the United States could be headed for no-car societies as well. "Car ownership per household and per person has started to come down in the past two to three years." The abolishment of car usage helpe protect the environment and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.

In Bogota, Colombia, a new kind of celebration has been put into effect. The "Day Without Cars" is an annual day in the capital of Colombia where the use of cars is not permitted. Substitute activities include: biking, hiking, taking buses, and skating. Selsky wirtes that the goal was to encourage the citizens to use public transportation and reduce the pollution that clotted up the airways in the people. The only mode of transportation allowed was buses and taxis. There were twenty five dollar fines handed out to those who violated the rules. Selsky explains, "The day without cars is part of an improvemewnt campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city." These bicycle paths have helped to promote the non-polluting modes of getting around Bogota. The day has proven to be a success for not only Bogota, but other Colombian cities as well. On the third anniversary, Cali and Valledupar participated in the event as well. The capital city of Colombia has seen drastic changes in the condition of its city. Seltzky claims that recreational parks have popped up and the sidewalks have improved to put them in a better condition. Rush hour regulations have even been put into effect that have dramatically reduced the bumper to bumper traffic in the city.

Bogota, Paris, Vauban, and the United States have all proved that eliminating the usage of cars is beneficial to many aspects of the world. Each city has adapted it's own way that attests to the assets of not using cars.
