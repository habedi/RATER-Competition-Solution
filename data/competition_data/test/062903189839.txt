Dear Principle,

I am a student at you school and I have had some concerns on the phone policy. I have some ideas and suggestions on things that can be added or changed to the policy.

I think that all students should be able to carry their phones, but only in lunch, study halls, ands in hall ways. I think that if any student is caught with their phones in class they should get their phones taken away for the rest of the day. The students should get their phones back at the end of the day. Another thing is if they are caught three time the student should get a detention. I think that if you enforce those rules there will be less texting in class, less cheating, and it may raise grades because of the increase attention in class.

There are many reasons why the students need their phones. some of the students have their parents working and can not communicate with anyone in case of emergency , others have after school activity, others also have to call their parents to pick them up.

Many people will suggest to have the students go to the office to call their parents. That will only lead to packed offices. There may also be emergency that restrict people of getting out of the office.

There are lots of reasons why you may want the students not to have their phones but my opinion is that the reasons why they should have their phones out way the other reasons. In my opinion and all of my research that I personally did i think that the best choice would to let all of the children have there phones.

sincerely, your student
