Fellow citizens we should limit ower car usage and see the advantages that we can gain from it. Having a car can bring lots of tense and responsibility along with lots of money having to be spent. In (Source 1) it states that "When i had a car I was alwayse tense. I'm much happier this way," Car ownership require lots of of money to be spent on the car ,on a garage and even a parcking space. In (Soure 1) it states that "Germany car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space,for $40,000, along with a home". An advantage from limiting your car usage would be to make the cities denser, and better for walking. In (Source 1) it states that "While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs".Â
