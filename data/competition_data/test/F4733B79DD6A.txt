Would you like to go to wonderfull places, be called a cowboy, and help people and cities from world war two? Well if you do you should give this job a try. The name of this job is the seagoing cowboy program. This argument will be about the reasons you should join the progrm and deatails about the program.

My first reason is you get to travel to cool places in the article it says they traveled to places in europe for Example China. They also went to Greece,Venice Italy. So like i said in the beggining this will be very good for travaling.

My second reason will be you can help cities from wrold war two. In the passage it says "In 1945 world war two was over in Europe, and many cities were left in ruins". It would be a great thing to do if you helped the people hwo lived there and you will be happy about it.

My third reason will be you get two take care of animals and hwo does not like animals. In the story they take care of animals on a boat and take's them to diffrent countries. Animals are fun to take care of think ot them as your pet.

In conlusion I hope that this argument helped you realize why you should be a seagoing cowboy.
