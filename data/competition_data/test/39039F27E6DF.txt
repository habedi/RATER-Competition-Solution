If there were driverless cars i would go crazy because i hate walking. Its not that im lazy its just that it wouldn't feel right without any cars. There should not be driverless cars because everyone doesn't enjoy walking very much. It probably would be some type of other transportation instead of cars such as a train, bike, bus etc.

Just imagine if there were no cars, train stations would be crowded. There would probably be arguments all the time. It just wouldn't feel right. If this was to happen i would try evrything in my power to try and stop it.

What's going to be on the roads, the world would just look empty as if nobody was ever on earth. I dont think everybody in this world would get the mindset of not having a car. Some people might think it's possible, but thats not humily possible. It would have to be some type of debate for something like this to happen, but honest opinion is that it'll never happen. Only if everybody thought the same then maybe it can be pulled off. There should be a debate for this.
