One of the planets in the solar system, Venus is one of most brightest points of light in the night sky. Sometimes it can be called the "Evening Star". Venus can be simple to see from the distant, but it can be challenging to examine more closely. The author who wrote this article about "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. There are reasons that Venus can be worthy but dangerous at the same time.

The planet Venus can be dangerous because, it can cause natural disasters in our environment. In paragraph 3, it states that "Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Another reason why Venus can be dangerous because, it has alot of heat. In the text it says, " Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system".

Not only is our planet Venus can be dangerous, it can be very worthy too. In paragraph 5, it states that "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus".

In the text it states that, " peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditons because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography inneffective". So that his how the author supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers.
