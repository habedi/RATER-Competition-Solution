Dear principle,

I think community service is very important to our city because many cities are filthy and dirty and need cleaning, if we can get the whole school to do it, it would be great, and it would also become a good opportunity for our city, but i don't think it would be fair if the whole school is forced to do it, i would prefer if you were to make a list so people are free to sign up if they want to join community service.

Another example why community service shouldn't be highly instructed is because some kids might have some important things to do at home and might not have free time to help the community. Also not many kids have time to help because of all their homework and chores they might have at home.

The list would be an excellent idea because the people that sign up would most likely have time to help and would probobly be dedicated to doing community service. Although not many people would be doing community service you would know that the people that signed up are a dedicated group of people and would be glad to help.

Many people don't know all the pollution that is out there is killing animals and slowly destroying our planet' soon our planet will be completely a mess and would be a horrible place to live. Many people don't believe in global warming but there has been some evidence of global warming. One piece of evidence is there has been a major decrease in water. The water level is lowering and will soon be completely gone, witch will then lead to death.

Many people argue about this but all this pollution is doing a lot of harm to all the living things in the world. these are some of many reasons why we need community service so i hope you take my advice and use it for future reference.
