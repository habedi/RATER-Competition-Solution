Zroom! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.

There is only so much space on earth and alot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of near-record pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

In conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although its ok to use them in moderation; they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment.
