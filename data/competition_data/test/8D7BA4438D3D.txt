I had fun joining the Seagoing Cowboys program and so will you. If you join you will have so much fun you will want to join again.

I think others should join in the Seagoing Cowboy program because it"s so much fun and not only that but you can travel to many places and also help others. The places that I went to were across the Atlantic Ocean and to China. When we were doing our crossings careing for animals kept me busy. It was alot of hard work but it also was fun. On my secon trip I stayed overnight as a watchman. Other places I went to were Venice Italy, Greece and along the Panama Canal. I also found time to play on board. We played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis,fencing, boxing, reading and whittling. Being a Seagoing wasnt just an adventure for me it opend the world to me. I am grateful that I took the opportunity.

I hope you can take my essayto make you think about being joining the Seagoing Cowboy program. Trust me you will never regret joining.
