Dear TEACHER_NAME,

If you want a student's honest opinion, I say that you let the kids use their cell phones at any free time as long as they put it away during class. I'm sure that you know that many students use their phones during class, and a lot during lunch. So if you let them do it at any free time, they won't be occupied to do something with it i class. They will be focused in class because they've already done everything that they need to do on their phone, and no longer require its use. Also, they'll respect you more and think of you more as a cool principal who c they can respect and follow directions from. I know that being cool isn't what you're supposed to do in you're job, but the students will listen to you more. If you set up a stern yet fair policy saying that students can use their cell phones at any free time as longs as they don't have it out during class, they will listen. They will think that's it's a fair policy. Also you need to tell them that if they do have cell phones out in class, that they will be confiscated until the end of the week, no exceptions. They will then be feared into not using their phones in class, and will not take them out. So you see, this is a win-win situation. The students get to use their cell phones, which they love to do, and you get better students out of it because they will pay attention in class because they won't think of using their phones. As long as you and all the teachers stick to the plan and don't make any exceptions, the policy will work. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Also, you could ask several students if they would obey the policy if you started it. If the ,majority say yes, then instate the policy. But do the survey before you start the policy. Also, you can hold the students accountable, because if they put their names on the survey, and they said yes, and then get in trouble, you could add on more consequences because they bribed you into getting something that they wanted. So that's my answer. Let us use our phones, and we won't take them out in class and we'll do better in class.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
