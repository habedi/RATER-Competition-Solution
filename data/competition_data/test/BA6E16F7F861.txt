Dear Principal,

To whom it may concern. I hereby say that you should go along with Policy number 2. The reason i go along with Policy number 2 is because, with cell phones during school kids get distracted easily and you may never know they can text behind your back. With cell phones during school many kids don't seem to care or even acknowledge that they have work to do or they have homework. This can also bring most of the kids grade down and it will effect the school and their education. Wait hold up, you want to know one reason that will really blow your head off that when your finishing reading this sentence automatically you'll be like "heck nahh Policy 2 is what I'm going to pick."

lol yup i know I'm funny. Well getting back to the letter. I am totally against Policy 1 which is to allow students to have their phones whenever they want but, to turn it off when their inside of class. Many students and im not going to lie I am one of the few, we intend on texting behind the teachers back. Then as soon as the teacher look back to speak or to tell us something quick we put our phones away so we won't get caught. You want to know what the funniest thing is, its that the teachers don't even have a clue about what their doing and I myself laugh behind their back because the teachers are so full of it. That it's not even funny.
