Your Principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Do you agree? Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills, build life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. Yes, i think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills. Many people have various forms of social anxiety or they may just be naturally shy, but bonding over something you both enjoy doing can build true friendships that can last a lifetime. For example, i'm a competitive dancer, and i remember when i first stared dancing, i was shy and didnt like to do anything that was out of my comfort zone. Now i've been dancing for almost 9 years and my favorite people are my friends at my dance studio. While i started off shy and scared to talk to new people, i have become best friends with the people i was shy around, i believe if everyone does a club or activity, everyone would have amazing friendships like mine.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social skills and a great way to build life skills too. soccer is a sport that builds control, endurance, and good sportsmanship, while a club like Beta club, is a club that builds leadership skills and gives you the opportunity to help those around you. There is something different with every activity, if you try and find a club or activity that helps to build the skills you are interested in or skills you would like build, then you might just end up having a good time and it might just be something you'll want to do as a profession.

Clubs and Activities are a great way to build social skills, build life skills,and also a great way to enhance your future. Clubs and activities will build skills you will use for the rest of your life. If you do a academic club, you might win first place in a really big category, that win will look really good on your college application. If you do a sport, college scouts might be at your game and they might recognize you and give you a free scholarship to a college and maybe that college will be one you really wanted to go to. Clubs and activities can benefit your future in so many more ways then you might think.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social and life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. when your principle asks you if your going to do an extracurricular activity, what will you say?
