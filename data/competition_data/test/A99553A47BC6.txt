We live in the 21st century the century of technology. Cell phones are a detrimental part of today's modern society. As big of a deal a they may be they are creating a big problem in the united states. Texting and driving, and calling and driving. There are certain function and tools you can use to prevent this from happening. And a big fraction of accidents on the road are caused by cell phones. I will explain what we can do to keep this from happening.

The 21st century is definitely the century of technology. We have all of this new tech being invented. Electric cars, jetpacks, and including our cell phones. Cell phones have come a long way since they were invented in 1973. We used to only be able to use them in homes and businesses. But once they were mobilized society and the way we lived changed forever. That means that they could be taken anywhere and everywhere. This was only the start of something that was great and horrendous.

The problem that they were creating was called texting and driving. Texting and driving is a dangerous task. Its is so dangerous that in some states it is illegal to have a cell phone in your hand while you're driving a motorized vehicle. That is how much of a problem that texting and driving has caused. Same with calling and driving. They are both equally as dangerous when it comes to driving. Cell phones have caused numerous injuries and casualties. Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6million crashes each year. 1 of every 4 cars accidents are caused by using a cell phone while operating the motor vehicle.

What makes it worse is that nowadays we have tools and function built into our phones so we don't have to have them in our hands to use them. We now have bluetooth headphones so that we can answer calls without using our hands. We also now have handsfree modes that are built into our phones. Nowadays we really have no excuse to be hands on with our phones. There are a multitude of ways we can use them so we don't end up getting ourselves hurt in the process.

In all, choosing to text and drive or to not text and drive is purely a personal safety choice. Texting/Calling and driving while have the phone in your hand will forever be dangerous. Keep in mind the death caused by texting and driving and such. It is nothing to be toyed around with. Stay safe and put down the phone while driving. Or you will become one of the victims.
