Dear principal,

I am writing this letter to discuss about weather we will have community service or not. My opinion is that we should each get certain hours of community service. If people do community service then it will be good for the city or town and the little kids.

I think this because kids should be taught things that they don't know so they will be better prepared for the future. If kids were in third grade and they got taught things outside of school about fourth grade, they would know more and it would be better for them. Also when you touter older kids like eight graders. They should be prepared for high school. If they are, then they will do good and they will succeed and not be very busy with homework that they don't know how too do or that they don't get. I would like to be better prepared for high school myself.

Also people should clean up liter to make the town or city cleaner and a better place to live. If people didn't clean up then they wouldn't be able get places without seeing trash.

Or they will be walking in trash all the time. If this was the case would clean up the city right away in my community service. What if the mayor or even the president was coming to the town or city and they saw all of the trash and garbage everywhere. they wouldn't think much of the town. if the town or city was clean and neat with not a lot of trash around and with people to clean it up, the president or the mayor would like the town or city and give it money and advertise for it so that it would make money.

That why we should have community service for the town or city. If we don't then our town or city will be uneducated or dirty and unclean. so let there be community service.

sincerely, your students
