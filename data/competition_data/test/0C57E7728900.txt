Dear TEACHER_NAME you should not allow kids to us their phone in class or anywhere in school because they will get distracted and not do their class work and not pay attention to the teacher. Another reason why you shouldn't allow phones in school because the kids could call their parents to come pick them up when their not even sick. Or when their a test going on and the kid doesn't know the answer the kid could just text his friend for the answer.

One day i was inn class and this kid was sitting in the back of the class with his head down not listening to the teacher who was teaching the lesson so i thought to my self he already knows this. So after the teacher stopped teaching she gave out the class work and the kid still had his head down and we only had 10 minutes to finish the test. So after five minutes he puts his head up and starts to ask everyone what did we have to do and nobody told him. Finally time runs up and the teacher asked him why he didn't do his work and he didn't answer so she herd his phone vibrate and she asked him to give it to her and she saw that he was texting some one from another class so she gave him detention.

Another reason why you shouldn't allow phone at school is because kids just text their parents to pick them up saying their sick when their really not. So one day I am in math class and by the speaker they called a kid in my class down because he was sick and was going home early and when the kid got up to leave he had a smile on his face. So the teacher stopped him and asked him what was wrong with him and he started to walk faster and didn't responded to her and he just left the class.

Finally the third reason why you shouldn't allow kids to use their phone in school is because when their is a test and the kids are stuck in a question that they don't know they will text their friends to get the answer. Like on day my teacher past out this test and twenty minutes after the test a phone rings and it was this kids phone who sits in the back of the class so the teacher asked for it and he saw the someone sent him a message with an answer. So the teacher confiscated his phone and gave him an F on the test.

so now you know why i think phone shouldn't be allowed in school because the kids will text their parents to come pick them up get distracted in class and cheat on their test .

So please TEACHER_NAME
