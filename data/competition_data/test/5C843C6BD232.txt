My opion on this is student should not attend home school because it won't help them to become a better learner. The first reason why is because If i was a student who attended home school and needed help for one question that i didn't understand i woulnd't understand it, Why because the online internent won't help me to become a better learner or better in the future, im not going to learn anything from it besides looking for what it means and copying it from the screen. My next reason why student shouldn't attend home school because what if a student was doing a math promblem and didnt know how to solve the question and the student actually needed help from a teacher to help them for something that the student didnt't even know how to solve the question, i would of ask the teacher instead of me looking up a video. Third reason why student should not attend home school because student in home school learner you have aleast 2 or 3 hours of learning each activity in the computer which that not a good thing for our brain student are not learning anything All student should have the right to go to school and to not attend home school the reason why because each and every home learner student arin't learning anything from a computer The student needs help from a real teacher and not from a computer. Last, if the website for all classes that student should learn and take and if the website really wanted to help our student in home school the webite should be free for our student to learn the activity that they have to take to gradurate.
