What is your idea self?

Someone whos smart and athletic?

Well let me tell you something.

You're not going to be that person by sitting on your butt watching 150 hours of the Office after school.

I think that every kid should have to participate in an extracurricular activity, whether its sports or a club.

Kids need to get out and do something.

If kids do and extracurricular activity its gets them away from their screens, helps with face to face interactions, and they need the extra physical activity because they dont get it in school.

Therefore I think that all kids should participate in a extracurricular activity.

First, kids are always on a screen of some sort.

When they are at school they are on screens. When they get home they are on their phone or on the TV.

After school activities are at least an hour or longer.

So if they get out of school at 3:35, with practice and the car ride they wont get home till around 4:50.

In addition, they might take a shower and they have to have dinner, so that takes a lot of screen time away.

With them doing an activity after school, it will get them away form their technology and they will be doing something productive.

Secondly, with kids being on their phones all the time, they dont get a lot of face to face interactions.

Doing an activity after school would help with getting that practice in.

It would force them to interact with other people and to make new friends.

Once kids get older they will not know how to look someone in they eye while talking, because they dont have to do that while testing someone.

Finally, its the only time kids can get real physical activity.

In gym they don't get a lot of exercise.

Kids don't like having to participate in activities that dont enjoy, especially with people they don't know.

If they don't want to do something they wont put in any effort.

At least when they are on a team they make bonds and friendships so that they enjoy what they are doing and put in the effort.

In conclusion, I agree that the principle should make kids participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

So that while they are doing their extracurricular they are wasting their screen time.

It helps they practice the face to face interaction with people.

Lastly, so it gives them the physical activity they need.
