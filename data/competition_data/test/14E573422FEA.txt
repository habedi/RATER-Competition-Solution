Mrs. Principal,

I believe that students should a B average to participate in sports or any extra-curricular activities at school. If any of the students have less than a B average and they want to participate in sports, I think they should be given help in school, so they can get a B average.

The reason I support the idea of changing school policy regarding sports and activities is because I think that if students will participate, then they will not spend any time studying or paying any attention in school.

One of the most important reasons why a lot of students have low grades is sports. Some students believe that sports are more important than school. I believe that changing school policy would help bring grades up in our school. If a student with a GPA lower than 3.0 wants to participate in sports, then he/she will try harder in school, to get his/her GPA to 3.0 or higher.

Thank you for taking your time to read my response, and I hope that it was good enough to grab your attention.

Yours truly,
