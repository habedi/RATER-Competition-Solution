The author supports his idea in studying Venus in many ways. Exploring Venus can lead up to many ways to improvise. If we study Venus we can learn more about the planet, such as, if it was once an earth like planet . It could also help us even save the Earth in the long run. My final reason why we should explore Venus is because it can lead us in exploring other planets.

First of all exploring Venus has a tough task, but we can learn a lot about the planet if we do explore it. We could even find out if it was once an earth like planet. We could discover new oils or new rocks. If we do discover new oil we could even put a mining system on Venus and have more oils. Exploring Venus can even help us find new minerals as well. We could discover many new things if we explore Venus ,dispite it having challenges.

Second of all Venus could have been an earth like planet." Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system" If this was true we could make more and more explorations and maybe even find out why it heated up so much and if we find everything out it could help us maybe even save earth one day when the sun expands more. It can help us save our planet .

Third of all If we decide to explore Venus we would have to improvise all of our machinery to sustain that heat on Venus. The heat on Venus averages to 800 degrees fahrenheit and also the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than what we expierence here on our own planet. We would have to make our machines and robots heat resistant. These innovations could even help us explore other planets. It would make the innovations easier if we want to explore colder planets in the future. This can spark an exploration of many other plantes. It could even help us reach other galexies and explore there. Exploring Venus can help us invent and Innovate many of our technology and it can end up helping us explore the whole solar system.

In conclusion exploring Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers would help us out a lot. As i explaned in the paragraphs above, it can help us improve and succeed. We would earn so much more about the planet, such as if it were actually a earth like planet . We could also discover many new things such as oils and minerals. Last of all it could help us in exploring other planets. It can help our innovations get easier so we could explore colder planets too. This is why exploring Venus would help us , even though it has lots of risks it could still help us out in the future.
