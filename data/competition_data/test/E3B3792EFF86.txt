Dear school principal,

I think that you should have the students perform community service for an optional thing. They should decide if they want to do community service or not. But if you do force them to do the work for community service, will they try and give effort. Also will they have a bad attitude doing community service? I say that you should not require all students to perform community service.

First, they should decide whether they wont to or not. Everyone is not going to all do it, it's what they want to do. Some people like to do things for the community and some people don't like to. It is the right thing to do is to do community service, but you shouldn't force someone into doing it. If you do want to do community service, then do it. However, I am saying that you should require all students to do community service.

Secondly, if you do require all students to perform community services, will they try or give effort in what they are doing. I see people who do work and they don't give any effort in what they are doing. They slack off. Also it is hard for you to convince or persuade someone into working harder and that they are not even wanting to do it. I have some friends who perform community service because they like to and want to . My other friends think it is too much time away from what they need or want to do. The friends that say it's a waste of time are not going to give effort if they are doing community service if they have to do the work. So not everyone is wanting to do it, so you shouldn't require all students to perform community service.

Lastly, will there (the people who say it's a waste of time) attitude in working in community service last long if there working? Say if you sign everyone to picking up litter after school for an hour. Will the people who say it's a waste of time have a good attitude about working and picking up the litter. Some students will have a good attitude about picking up the litter will have a better moral than the others.

The most important part of why I am writing you this letter is that you should give the option on who will do community service or not. You shouldn't just say that everyone will or won't do community service. You should just give the option.

You got to think of the possibility's I gave you and make up you mind. Thank you.

From a fellow student.
