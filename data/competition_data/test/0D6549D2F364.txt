Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe you should make everyone in the school do Community Service because it shows people how to work as a team. Also it helps the world and our community become a better place to live. People wouldn't wan' t to live in a community where it is trash everywhere they go. We should also have a school clean up day and give the janitor a break(day off).He/She shouldn't have to pick up after us. We should make sure we don't make a mess and if we do then we should pick it up. Its also good to tutor Children so they can become a smarter person. They can be come the next president of the United States. Sometimes community service takes a long time but it is worth it if you are helping the world or just making a kid even more smarter then what they were. If we can make our Community a better place imagine how much we can change the world.

Sincerely ,From STUDENT_NAME
