Distance learning means the ability to work from home, some schools allow students to do this. I disagree with this because students wouldnt be as focus as they are in regular school, students would get distracted easily, students would probably allow someone else to do there work for them, and students would be losing physical exercise.

Distance learning would have the students not focus and have them distracted because of other household actives. For example, say if the student is trying to complete his or her online classes, he or she can easily get unfocused because of a crying baby or even loud siblings. Another example, could be a students favorite TV show is on while he or she is completing his or her assignment they can get distracted and stop working just to watch the show. Instead of the student finishing there work he or she may have to do chores or even have practice for a sport that they may play. Students get distracted to easily just by other household actives.

With distance learning the teacher or Procter would never know whose doing the work. In regular school if the student needed help or had an question about an assignment the student could ask, but working from home the student may not ask for help he or she may just get someone else to do it for them. In that case, that means that the student is not actually learning. The student could not actually be watching the videos or doing the work he or she could just be clicking through them. An example could be, say if the student learns better with hands-on assignments and work, the student wouldnt be able to meet there standards because they do not have the proper help.

The students would be also losing physical exercise because instead of actually getting up in the morning and actually moving around, the student may just be laying in the bed all day. Another reason is that there wouldnt be any sports like track, dance, soccer, football, basketball, and a marching band if every thing was online. In regular school the students have gym and exercising, but with distance learning thats getting taken away. According to scientist in regular school you lose at least 5 to 10 pounds a week, and thats just by walking up and down the stairs and moving through the hallways. Physical exercise would be taken away with online learning.

As an result, I disagree with distance learning because it does not have an good affect on the students mentally and physically.
