The advantages of limiting car usage is very important to the enviorment. The artlice clearly sates limiting car usage will have a great impact on the enviorment and make the world much more "green". The reduce usage of a car will help the world in many different ways. The United States Environmental Protenction Agency wants to start a "car reduced" town community and have people use thier car less and less every day untill they don't use it at all. Citizens of the United States spend so much money on gas every day, every week, every month and all this money will eventually adds up throughout the year, imagine how much money you could be saving without paying for all that gas?

First off, having no car will save you thousands of dollars. You could even live a happier life, in the article it states "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter "(In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars)." This tells you that with no car you can live a happier life, you don't need a car to be happy. Imagine being stress free, no car trouble saving money on gas? That sounds pretty amazing to me. You could have much more money in your pocket to spend on other things that maybe you could never buy when you were wasting all you money into your gas tank. Problem solved, GET RID OF YOUR CAR! To live a "car free" life you have to want it and stop pollting the earth.

Second of all don't you want to get rid of car trafic? Having a car doesnt benefit youat all, it only hurts you. Cars pollute the air you have to pay inurance, car payments, gas money. In the article "(Paris Bans driving due to smog)" states that cars are being towed and over 4,000 drivers are being fined for their car. "Tweny-seven people had their cars impounded for their reacion to the fine" (Paris bans drivig duet o smog). If you don't want the trouble of having your car impounded or being fined it easy to just get rid of our car your helping not only yourself but the world.

Cars are banned in Bogota, Columbia. Cars being banned in Colombia is a great thing it saves people money and helps the earth. "It was the third year cars have been benned wih only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in the capital city of 7 million" ( Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota). Cars leaving the streets in bogota helped out alot people don't want to be fined for having a car so why not just get rid of it. No one actually needs a car anyways you just want one so you don't have to walk places. If you need to go a long distance then just take a taxi or bus thats no hard to do. The least ou can do is walk a extra mile a day the spending tons of money on gar to drive there.

Not to forget, cars do not help the enviorment and witout them is a great impact on the earth. "It's a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota). Rain shouldnt stop anyone from going to there destination riding your bike in the rain isnt hard so start doing it. Enjoy the out doors and get out frombeing couped up indoors all the time its healthy to get a little fresh air. Getting rid of our car and using a bike or even walking will help out your savings and the earth.Â
