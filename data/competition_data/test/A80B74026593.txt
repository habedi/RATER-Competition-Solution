Doing extracurricular activitys is like having field day, they are fun and you can do many different activitys. The principal wants all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activitys. Here are some reasons I agree to having extracurricular activitys for all students. For, it can help build social skillls, it can give students a chance to exercise, and can decrease boredem and stress.

To begin with, building social skills is an good way to make new friends for example, you can make new friends by joinging new clubs, meeting new people such as coaches, and learing and sharing new ideas between people in your activity. Some students may be shy when it comes to new people; joining clubs like bookclub and art is a great way to find people that has the same interest as you.

Next, many students may want a chance to exercise by joining sports. Joining different sport teams can help with exercise for example, track can increase your cardiovascular indurance and build your speed. Using sport activitys can teach students how to exercise and how to be healthy.

Also, students may want to join extracurricular activitys to decrease boredem and stress. Joining these activitys can get your head out of stressing situations. Say you failed a test you would not feel so great afterwards but to get your mind out of it you can go to your extracurricular class and study more for your next test of get you mind off things. Serving as student council can decrease boredem by setting up school dances and a bunch of other fun activitys.

However, some students may disagree and not want to participate in extracurricular activitys due to being lazy, grades, or behavior. When students are to lazy they tend to skip out on things like sports. Grades are a big part in not being able to join a extracurricular activity due to lack of doing homework, or not participating in class. Behavior in some students may affect them from joining a club too because their mother or father may want them to change their behavior first.

In conclusion, I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activitys. For, it can help build their social skillls, students can get chances to exercise, and decrease boredem and stress. These are great ways for students to make new friends and build goals for the future.
