Regarding the decision the Principal made, ("all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity")

I agree with for the following reasons.

The first reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will improve social life for many students at our school.

Social Life is very important for kids my age because, it helps build character, (which means, it builds up personality and special traits within a certain student) creates new friendships, (always a good thing to have) and it will also make the student feel like they're a part of something.

Another reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will also help students who are dealing with personal stress. As everyone knows, a lot of kids my age suffer from different types of stress. Which are mostly caused by either depression, anxiety or even loneliness. Which means that with this new opportunity they have, their depression, anxiety, and loneliness might go down a bit as they get to interact with other students while they participate in activities they might of never even tried before.

The final reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will even help students develop time management skills. Most students at our school (that I know of) either don't have time or don't know how to fit everyday activities like school, homework, and free time in their everyday lives. So, since they have to participate in something new now, it might open up their eyes a bit and help them see how to distribute their time, which will result in them having some free time at the end of the day.

In conclusion, I think the Principal's decision to make students attend or take an extracurricular activity is a great idea because, it improves social life, lowers stress some students might have, and also helps students develop time management skills.
