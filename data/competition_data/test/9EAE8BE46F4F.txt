With long breaks, students tend to forget important information they've learned throughout the school year. Summer projects are required for some schools to keep the student's brain on track during the long break. But, what nobody thinks about is, who should design these projects? More over, Should teachers or students design these projects? Many people argue summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed; however, no one thinks about a student/teacher-designed project.

Projects made by students and teachers can cover the relevant topics with creative ideas such as: phone projects, video game projects, and sports projects. This can create diversity amoungst all projects and help the student have an exciting experience. Now-in-days Students spend their daily lives on their phones, assigning a project on their phones would make it easier for the student to navigate and be comfortable with the environment their in. For example, a teacher could create a class account on social media and post or request projects during the summer, and because students are always on their phone, they should be able to complete the projects assigned. Motivating a student to stay on track can be quite difficult if the material is boring or uninteresting. A student and teacher collaboration can grasp both sides of the spectrum and pull thoughts, ideas, and examples and put them all in one to make a great project idea.

Throughout my junior year in high school i've done many projects and essays in most of my classes and they've all been teacher-designed. The most freedom i've probably gotten is just picking which assigned topic i'd like to write about or do research on but thats pretty much it, I'm very limited. For example, in my second period my teacher assigns many essays on politics or current events. Not everyone is interested in those topics so some of the students my class dont take the time to research and just copy and paste information found on websites. This makes students lazy and in the end they dont learn anything, they only thing they've learned is a bad habit. A recommendation i could make to my teacher is have more variety, more options, or even maybe a topic more interesting to provide to his students.

Another great teacher of mine, Generic_Name, has the most variety and is willing to work with a student. Although he assigns teacher-designed essays, we have the freedom to pick our topics and what we get to write about. He helps morph your ideas into complex thoughts to satisfy the writer and the rubric. Furthermore, helping the student to think deeper and be interested in doing their essay. The teacher having some flexibility allows the student to enjoy what they're doing and finish their task.

All in all, students and teachers can be affected greatly if projects were student/teacher-designed. A collaboration between students and teachers can create a connection leading to a greater outcome and success. Teacher-designed projects can also create a stressful environment for the students, and allowing student ideas to flow into teacher-designed projects creates a healthy environment for students minds. Students and teachers can build off each other and have a great relationship because, "

great minds think alike ."
