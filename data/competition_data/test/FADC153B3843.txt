The school policy that states students should have a B grade average in my opinion is a little unreasonable. The reason i say this is because even though grades are important it really shouldn't effect your ability to play sports. Many schools allow you to have a C average which is usually easier for students to achieve. The thing is that even though academics are a huge part of your school life, what does it really have to do with sports and other activities?

Now i do understand that if someone is failing all there classes they do need to be talked to and possibly take away the privilege of playing sports. This should be used only if the students grades are below passing. Even-though there a several people who can maintain above class average scores and enjoy sports and other school related activities doesn't mean everyone else does too. You may have a really good basket ball player that is bad with English this shouldn't mean he cant play basketball anymore. To me its a little unfair.

Academics are certainly an important part of our school life but even though some of us are better at it then others doesn't mean you need to take away the privileges of their school related activities.

I do see that you are a very important person being you are the principal of our fine school so I do hope that you understand were I'm coming from when i tell you that to some of us our activities weather during or after school are important to us and even though we may not good grades all the time shouldn't mean that we can no longer participate in the activity of our choosing. Thank you for your time in reading this and i do wish we can peacefully figure something out between raising the grade you must have for being a part of sports or any other school activity.
