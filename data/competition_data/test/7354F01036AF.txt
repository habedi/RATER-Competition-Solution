Phones and Driving

In this age of the world almost everyone has a phone of some kind and this includes drivers among us. Phones usually are a little distraction nothing more, but when they are driving that distraction can become deadly. In recent years the fatalities by car wreck have gone up dramatically and usually the reason these days is texting while driving. In most states if you are caught you will have some sentence or a fine of some kind. It doesn't even have to be texting that distracts a person from driving, it can be from kids in the car to the radio.

In the state of georgia there is a pretty new law called the "hands free law"which tells drivers that they can't even touch their phones while driving. When drivers are not parked even at stoplights if their caught on their phones they will get a fifty dollar fine. The law makers made this in mind to make people not take any selfies or videos or anything like that. In reality people will try even harder and be more reckless to try and do the videos their doing. On the other hand though they say that dash cams are ok to use.

However, there are exceptions to this law such as using stereo bluetooth speakers in the car with spotify. Another exception they make is for directions apps like google maps. They also make exceptions for informing the authorities about a crime or something similar. While they said we can listen to music or streams or stuff like that we can't touch our phones while doing so. Given these reasons i don't think that drivers should be able to use their phones while driving.
