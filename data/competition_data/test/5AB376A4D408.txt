Everywhere we go we see everyone's face and facial expressions. They could either be good or bad. But what if you had a computer to tell what emotion they were going through if you did not know?

Prof. Thomas Huang and his partner have created an algorithm to depict what emotion a person is having. This technology is very valuable because we have never seen something like this before, it can even read emotions on a persons face from a painting. It uses all 44 major muscles in your face and depending on what muscles a person is using, they can depict what emotion you are going through. For example the author states in paragraph 3 that, "your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you're surprised; your orbicularis ori (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger".

In conclusion, this technology could end up being the next big thing just because of the simple fact that it is very new and could be used later on as part of something bigger. This technology could even end up changing how we think as humans and the way the world works today.
