Being a Seagoing Cowboy does sound like a lot of fun. I think being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun.

First you are helping others.

It sounds fun to do, you have something to do, you are being a hero. you get to do a lot of traveling and sightseeing

You get to see things you have never seen before.

Seagoing gives you the chance to see different when you travel. You kinda become a role model when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. You are looking out for others i think you should be responible and caring to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It could be a lot of fun and make you happy to protect people. You are making people feel safe.

In conclusion i think the Seagoing Cowboy program is good for people and they should join it. It's an important and fun job, sometimrs you get hurt and it can be dangerous but it awesome. Just be careful with dangers at sea.
