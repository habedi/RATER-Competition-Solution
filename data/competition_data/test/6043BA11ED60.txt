I think that the school policy should not be changed because some students might not be necessarily book smart but they might be a really good athlete. If the school raises the average needed to play in a sports from a C

to a B then any student that falls short on the average might get upset and their grades might drop even lower than before. causing even more academic problems for that student. I also believe that if the average grade needed to play sports goes up then the good athletes might be overlooked just because he or she got a lower average then what was required.

If a lot of students fall below the required average then that school would most likely fall behind on competitions between other schools. This unlikely but, some student could start to gain weight. i also believe it is a inconvience on the parents, because if that students parents are at work while the student is at after school sports, and then the student gets kicked out of that sport because of his grade average then this could cause the parent to have to work less hours meaning less pay and that can put a family in a bad position.
