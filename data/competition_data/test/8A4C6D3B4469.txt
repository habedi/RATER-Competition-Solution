Dear Principle,

I believe that not letting students participate in sports without a B average is a good idea. Students active in sports generally don't have much time for studying and homework because they are so occupied in their sport and are too busy with practices. If a student has a B average in school, then they most likely are a hard-working student that believes their grades are very important. If they have a lower grade average, then it is possible that the student will slip farther behind in class and have assignments piled up.

Students that participate in sports have practices very frequently and usually after school. If a student is working on sports and practicing so hard and so much, they will not have much time for homework. If they start to fall behind on homework, they don't finish it or they get points taken off, or they don't learn anything from a class discussion that refers to the homework.

If a student has a B average in school they are generally a hard worker and will find a way to juggle both school and sports and wont slip behind as quickly and they might if they had a C average and were already having a hard time understanding some concepts in the curriculum. Students in sports get home after practice exhausted and will most likely need to rest afterwards, creating a smaller gap of time for homework and studying. After resting, a C average student will start on his or her homework and probably need to figure it out first, read directions, then start having trouble part way through the homework, and it might take them more time to get it complete, then they will get frustrated and give up, not finishing. A B average student would rest up quickly and work hard on their homework to make up for the time they missed while at practice and not stop until it is completely finished, then check their answers and the next day will eagerly engage in the discussion on it

A B average student will take notes in class and work hard on assignments when a C average student might slack off a little, or not try as hard in class as others might. With sports concerned, the C average student will begin slacking off more and falling behind and will only be able to think about their next practice, concentrating on only sports. A B average student will focus on school very hard to keep their grades up so they can continue to be in sports. A rule that only B average students or higher can play in sports will be good for the students who work hard and might encourage students to keep their grades up so they too could be in sports and could easily boost the schools grade average and help kids learn better.
