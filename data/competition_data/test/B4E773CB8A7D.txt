Dear Senator, I wish to ask you a favor of keeping the Electoral College or changeing to election by popular vote for the presdent of the United States. First of all, the reason that I want to ask you this is because Most states have a winner take all system that they give to the winning president.

Next, after presidential election, the governor prepares a Certificate of Ascetainnent. listing all of the presidents who ran for president. after the presidental election is heild every four years on a tusedayafter the first monday in vovember. you help chose your states electors.

Furthormore, People should vote for a state of several Democratic electors pledged . On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election. oh yea and senitor under the eletoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president .

Finally, Fromm my opinion the presidental party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However, it is entirerly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not winthe nactional popular vote.

So Mr. senator sir im only asking you this one thing if u coud just keep the Electoral college or changing to election vote for the president of the United States. pleez thats all im asking from you toÂ  do for me just one thing. quite sime thing to do right ..
