Schools around the country are trying to find a better way to get kids occupied. So they came up with clubs and extracurricular acitivites to persuede them join. But some students do not find them very interesting, and would rather stay at home and do nothing but be on the internet the entire time. So what if your principal said that all students had to join at least one extracurricular activity? Would you agree with his choice, and be happy about it, or would you disagree with his choice, and be dissapointed? I agree with his choice because I think it is a great way to get students to connect with others, explore new options, and to keep them busy. I think it is a fabulous idea that they are making the students join more clubs, and keeping them occupied, so they don't have to stay at home and be around the internet and social media all the time.

One reason why I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because they can connect with others. I think it is a excelent way to meet new people and build new friendships and bonds. If I just joined a new club, and I didn't know a lot of people, I would take it as a great opprotunity to meet new people, and learn more about them. I think one way people become close is because of these clubs because they get to see more of the person and share the same similarities and connections as them. These students also get to spend more time and interact with other people, which I think brings students closer. This is why these activites can help students to connect with others.

Another reason why I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because they can explore more. This opprotunity that the principal is giving them is allowing them to try something new, and find their passion and what they love. Students might try something new and then find out that they really enjoy it. This is a great way to get students to find the things that bring them joy, and that gets them motivated. They can also learn a lot from the experience and it can dig them deeper into learning more about it. Even if the student doesn't like it, they now know that it wasn't the club for them, and it reminds them that they should try something different. That is what exploring is all about! This is why extracurricular activites can lead students to finding what they love.

The last reason why I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because it keeps them busy. These students will never be bored, and will get kids to work with others, and participate in activities. The clubs will keep them occipied and not at home as much. Even though these activities will take away time from family, it will be better for these students to learn more than to be at home on the internet and social media. I think it is a fun way to get out of their bedrooms and have a little fun outside of the house. Making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a fantastic way to occupie students.

Having clubs and activites is a great way to power students into learning more about themselves. They can explore new hobbies, and meet new people, and I think it is just an awesome way to motivate students. Being able to have the chance to participate in what you love is so fortunate and I think these students should take it for granted. I always loved to explore more about me a find out who I really am, and I think if I join a club or activity, I can find that. I want students to learn from this that if they try and put effort into something, then they will begin to enjoy that, and it will be better for them. This is why I think students should join at least one exracurricular activity for their own good.
