Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with you that kids should be getting at least a B or better average to be able to participate in school sports. Everyone has there bad days and maybe does bad on a test, and gets a D, but just because they had a bad grade doesn't mean sports and other activities should be taken away and also a lot of kids don't like school but love sports or a activity ,so you shouldn't take that away from them if they get a C or below in a class.

My first reason that our school shouldn't change the grade average for students to get into sport or activity is because a lot of kids have a hard time with school, but love sports. I must say that I'm a sport lover also I do a lot of school activities, and get A' s, and B' s. But occasionally I do get a lower grade on a test or homework. And if your teacher doesn't give you a lot of homework, that grade can bring your grade down a lot! So if I have a bad test score and that brings me down to a C, I can't join the cheer leading squad or the writing club? That's not right.

Another reason I don't think our school should switch to a B average in order to play sports or join activities is that not all kids are school smart. Even though teachers are helping them they just don't like or have trouble in school, but that doesn't mean there not smart or good in sports! We all have different likes and dislikes, and those kids shouldn't get there like taken away from them just because they don't succeed in school.

I hope that after reading this, you will maybe change your mind and bump it down to a D average, because a B average is just to difficult for a majority of us students.

Sincerely,
