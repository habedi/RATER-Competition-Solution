Driverless Cars Are Coming. Using support from the article, Heres my argument against the new developing smart cars.

Although some people might enjoy being shoufered around by their own automobile, is it really safe? Smart cars are controlled by computer systems and sensors through out the car, and other pieces of technology including video cameras, and GPS, but everything including techonlogy has its faults. The article even includes information stating that even driverless cars still need drivers. Their are many what if's in the article, one being "What If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault, the driver or the manufactuer?" As a result, in most states it is illegal.

People would not only have to worry about making sure their car doesnt malfunction but also worrying about who would be held reliable for faulty technology in and on their car. It states in paragraph 9 "New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident." Even with the newsest technology put in these smart cars, it cannot prevent a driver from being in an accident if the driver themselves is not aware and paying attention to the car alerts.

It states in paragraph 2 "Google cars arent truly driverless, they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents." In paragraph 9 it states "The only safe car has a human driver in control at all time." If so far all smart cars have had to require a driver then their is no true driverless car. With that being said and providing support from the article what is a driverless car?

In conclusion to this article, Driverless cars are not truly driverless and not proven to be as safe as a human being in control of the vehicle.
