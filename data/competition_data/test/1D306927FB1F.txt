Driverless cars? I feel as if they arent safe on the roads, like they are moe likey to get into an wreak. What would the driver do when the car was drivng its self. How would the car alert the diver quick enough to make the driver take the wheel. I just feel like these things wouldnt be safe on the roads.

Who would be responsable for the wreacks caused by these cars? the driver wasnt driving so how is it there fault? Would u blame the car or the person in the car? I just dont know what we would do if something where to go wrong with these cars while there on the road. How would we know who was responsable. These cars may be cool and may look fun, but what would we do when somthing goes wrong and the car doesnt seem fun or cool anymore. When someone gets injuied in the car would they take it off the market?

I just feel as if driverless cars are not the best thing that the everyday person would need, I feel as if people on the roads would be safe with out those cars on the roads. Also these cars might not even work when u need or what if the driver falls asleep and what if the car doesnt even know where it is going. How would we know that these cars would be a hunderad percent safe, or at least close to a hundered percent safe. This is why I feel the roads would be more safe without them on the roads.
