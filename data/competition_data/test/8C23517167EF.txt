Dear Principal,

I think that students should perform community service. Some students may think that community service is a waste of time, but they are wrong. It's not a waste of time. It can actually benefit you in the future. Community service can help you get into college. Colleges are sometimes picky about who they want in their college and they usually pick the one with a lot of community service hours because they know that the ones who are doing community service are students who are good and want to help the community. That is one of the thing that a college on a student's application.

Also, there are community service that can either be enjoyable and it can help you with your career path or help you find one. I got two friends who are doing Civil Air Patrol for their community service hour. They find it very enjoyable and it help them with their career path. I believe that Civil Air Patrol also give out scholarship for people.

As you can see principal, students should perform community service. It's not a waste of time like some of them believe. It could get them into college and give a bright future to look forward to. Isn't it your and the teacher job to help guide the students to have a good education and a shining future for all the future generations.

Sincerely,
