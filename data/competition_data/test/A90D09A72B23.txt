There are different advantages and disadvantages from studying from home, most of the people thing that there are more disadvantages, so students won't benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some of the reasons than affect the students are: the students won't pay the same attention studying on their home as studying in the school, it also would be easier for the students to cheat on the different activities without a teacher watching them, the network can get disconnected very easy, some of the students will study at the time they want without finishing what they are suppose to finish, and they won't live the same experience with their friends in the school.

Some students have some problems paying attention in the school, most of them getting distracted doing another thing that doesn't have to be with the class, they also need a teacher that keep they remindind to do their work or stop doing the other thing, so what do you think they would when they are in home with lots of different distractions or activities to do, they won't be able to pay the same attention, because they don't have the one person that tells them to be quite or be paying attention. Some times it's good to have someone that helps them remind to do what they are supposed to.

Although if the students can attend classes from home it would easier for them to cheat when they are on their home, lots of students cheat on most of their tests just to get a good grade and pass the class that they need to pass, in their homes they can reach every kind of information just by searching it, so what it's going to tell us that they won't do that, instead of studying hard to get the grades they need, it is necesary to have someone to supervise how they do the exams or works that need to be made by their own. If they keep cheating, they won't learn anything from the classes they are taking.

Also it can happen that you are on a important class or some test that you are taking, and the network can just turn down. It is risky to take classes in a computer, because you don't know when the network will work in a good way, or just don't work. It can make them lose some important lessons they need to take or make them fail a test because of the bad network, sometimes the screen can freeze in the half of an important thing, so it is important to don't trust to much in the electronic devices we have.

Most of the students don't like to studying, don't like to do homework, or just don't like to work. So if the students would be able to attend classes from home, lots of the students won't keep studying just because they don't want, they would be able to do whatever they want, because they don't have someone that helps them understanding and trying to get their work done. Most of the students don't do their work because they thing that won't be useful in their life, they need to understand that every topic in each class is important for the different things they are going to be through when they grow up.

It is also good for some students to come to the school to make some friends, and do other things they won't do on their home, it is a different experience to be with lots of people, to meet them, and talk about different interestings they have, some students like to come to school just to see their friends, that what make them happy. This helps you get a social life and be happier every day.

In conclusion, there are more disadvantages than advantages from being able to attend to classes in the computer from home, all of them to keep the student studying, and keep him doing his work in the way it is supposed to be, to improve his knowledge while he is in the school.
