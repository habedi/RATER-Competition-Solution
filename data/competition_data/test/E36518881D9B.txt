The new policy on weather a student should be able to bring a cell phone to school is not a hard one to make. We should be able to take them to school because what if something happens and we need to phone home our are stuck somewhere no one can here us. The fact of the matter is what damage could we really do with a cell phone its just an electronic device just like everything else.

What if someone needs to contact us and cant make it to school like are parents are in a car accident and need us to get out of class. Besides this could be a good thing for the teachers to they could call a student if they are not in class and make sure there ok plus we could put our home work on our phones we could also use the calculators on the phones so the teacher would not have to lend us any to use. We would also be a lot quieter instead of talking we would be texting. Cell phones are our link to the outside world.

How ever if there are problems with students using them in class you can ban them from using them for the week plus students with phones means students who can get there missing homework assignments.

I know I would like to use my cell phone in class. There also might be less late assignments coming into the classes which means smarter students and higher grades. T he one thing our teachers really want.

Now that you have read and understood my response I hope you take my opinion into considerations when you make your choice of the cell phone policy.
