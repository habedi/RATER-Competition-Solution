Most people either own a car themselves or know someone who owns one either way most people own a car. The fact is though that the advantages of limiting car usages adds up to about a billion but today im here to present just a couple to you.

As Ms. Walter says in the article "'I'm much happier this way'" (3) and see she owned a car and she always felt tense but now without a car she can hear the sound of bicycles and "'...chatter of wandering children'"(3). Many people just like her either own cars because they don't know how to live without them or they don't own cars and they are less tense and can hear the wonderful sounds of mother nature. Just think about it; how often do you hear birds chirpping or kids playing at parks or even leaves rustling? if you were honest you would say almost never because its true all of the motorized vehicles that we have in this world drown all of the best sounds out. We simply don't hear them anymore; no instead we hear a train running by at tweleve in the morning or the screech of tires at six in the morning on the way to school or even worse we hear tons and tons of car horns going off all at once just because someone isn't moving at a red light. Seriously do we even know how horrible all of that is and guess what its all because the human population wants to be able to get places faster.

Most people are noticing this now but in the past no on noticed that our own way of trassportation was and is polluting the world. In Europe 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emmisions are caused by passenger cars. Also "...up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"(5) are greenhouse polluted because of the cars. The human race can stop this "In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"(6). See thats the thing we can change this and we can survive with out cars. There is no disadvantage of limiting car use because we can live without them. Infact there are only advantages; we can stop polluting the earth, we can have a safer world, and we can finally hear mother nature and concentrate on something better in our lives. The thing is that we dont even have to go without cars because we have created electrical cars that are rechargable; yes they are very expensive but if we just used those then they would be alot cheaper. By having a car we are polluting the earth and by not having one we aren't; not polluting the earth is a advantage of limiting car usage.

The fact is that the advantages of limiting car usage out weigh the disadvantages of limiting car usage which is why having a car can help or hinder us; just depends on you look at it.
