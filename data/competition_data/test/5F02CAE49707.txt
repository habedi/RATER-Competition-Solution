Some schools require students to complete A summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. Should it be teacher-designed or student designed. I think it should be student-designed. One reason why i think it should be student designed is because more students will do it. Second reason is that a lot more of the students would have more to talk about.

One of my reason why i think it should be student designed is because it would get done by more of the students. when teachers ask you to do school work in the summer some students will forget and some will not even try but If the student could pick what kind of project they wanted to do more students would be interested.

My second reason is that if it was picked by the students they have more to talk about. Like they could pick something that is interesting to them. They wouldnt have to just think about school it could be about a lot more of stuff like sports,games,special events and a lot more stuff. It would be more special and a lot of the students would be creative and they could help each other with it.

That is why i think it should be student-designed. everything doesnt have to be picked out by teachers sometimes you have to let the students pick it out.
