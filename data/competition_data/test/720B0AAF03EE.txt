The planet Venus has many dangers but that doesn`t mean that it is impossible to explore. There hasn`t been a single spaceship, in more than three decades, that has touched down on Venus. Many different factors contribute to the reasons why there hasn`t been one. One factor is that the atmosphere is thick and contains almost 97 percent cabon dioxide. Another factor is that there are many, erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes.

Despite the dangers of studying Venus I agree with the author that it is a worthy pursuit. In paragraph four it states that "Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system". It might be important to explore Venus to collect data to predict the future of the Earth.

In paragraph five it provides a possible solution to explore the planet Venus. The possible solution is to create a blimp-like vehicle that would hover over the planets surface at about 30 or so miles. The blimp-like vehicle "would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way". The only limitation is that "hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective". Despite this it would still be good to be able to explore what we are able to and collect all of the data possible for further explorations.
