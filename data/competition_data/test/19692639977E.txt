The school should require a summer projects and they coud be students-designed because, summer is the opportunity for the students relax, It's going to be more interesting if they can choose what to do, and can be a project that they will enjoy learn about because they doing something that they are interesting, and the projec shold be extra graded.

Summer vacations are the most expected break for students because they have almost three months for relax and enjoy the hot summer,a lof of them travel to beach or summers houses and they don't expect to have school assignments, having the right to choose what to do is better for them to understand how important is for them to learn things outside school.

Students having the choice of your own project is going to make the work more interesting and they will enjoy doing and they will not struggling to turn in. they can design a project about how is the experience of summer, what he did, if he meet new people, which places he visited and what is the meaning of the word 'summer' for him. doing this, the projec is going to turn like a diary, will be part of his rotine and it's going to meka easy and nice.

Extra grade sounds like a good ideia because the students will start a new year on school and most of them will like to start the year already with a extra grade.

Projects are someting that we should be familiar with because if we are planning go to college, there they do so may projects and extra works. Having a summer project make the students keep the focus on school and even though being extra is something that you will not regret doing, will just help you get ready for your fucture without struggling.
