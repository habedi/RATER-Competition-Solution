Did you know that the majority of students currently or have participated in extracurricular activities? This is because there are many different forms of extracurricular activities that suit every student's needs or wants. I believe that schools should require every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they, build friendships outside of school, take the students' mind off the stresses of school and strengthen the body and mind.

Extracurricular activities build close bonds outside of school in many ways. They require students to get to know each other better than if they met at school, such as if they have different classes or friend groups. They Strengthen bonds that have already been formed, like those between two students that share a class. They allow for in inclusion of every student who participates in these activities.

Extracurricular activites are a very good way to relieve stress from school. Such as, if a student has had a bad day at school they can particiapate in their activity and release some of that stress. They also require students to think about things other than school. If a student is having issues with a certain subject in school, they can go to a team practice and stop thinking about that subject for a while. School based extracurricular activities also help form bonds between students and teachers, leading to a higher chance of a student asking for help in class.

Finally, extracurricular activities also help stregthen the body and mind. Students may participate in a book club or the debate team which help build confidence and intelligence therefore increasing school capabilities. However, sports like football or basketball help build physical strength and endurance. Participating in multiple extracurricular activities such as football and the cybersecurity team would be a perfect combination for building strength and intelligence.

The requirement of extracurricular activities is a very beneficial thing interms of building friendships, relieving stress and building physical and mental strength. All of these together create a very good reason why the principle should require every student to participate in at least one or more extracurricular activites. Should this rule be set in place the school shoud expect to see a boost in moral, grades and physical capabilities.
