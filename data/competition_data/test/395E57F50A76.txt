Schools often have plenty of activitys that students can enjoy. Some being sports or something to do outside of school. I agree that every student should perticipate in atleast one extracurricular activity. Not all students may want to do extra activitys, but theres always somthing for everyone. This will be good for students health, allowing them to be involved, and letting the students feel accomplished.

The most important thing to a student is their health. Perhaps by allowing the student to speak with other students would help their social life. Having them do other things than just school work could also be good for them. Giving the students something else to focas on could also be really good for them. Extracurricular activitys would be a really nice thing to happen to all schools.

Extra activitys would keep every student involved in the process. All students would be a perticipate for something whether it be playing a sport or working on the year book. While doing these activitys it lets the students do more than school work. Sometimes it can stress them out and they just need a break. Making them feel they dont want to be at school.

After doing an activity, the student may feel accomplished. They will feel confident about themselves. It could also help students feel responsible about themselves. It could also help students feel responsible with themselves.

This could direct their fuitur in better directions.

Every student needs to be in atleast one extracurricular activity. It could help prepare them for things they havint encountered yet in life. Not to mention the fun it would be to work on the year book or serve on student councle. school is too boaring these days. All students need that extra fun.
