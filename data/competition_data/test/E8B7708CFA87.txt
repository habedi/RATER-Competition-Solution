Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should go with 'Policy 1' because I think that you should allow students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times, but not in class. What if someone's parents couldn't get a hold of the school and it was a family emergency. Then they could text or call their child or children what has happened. Just as long as they didn't do it during a class period.

Using the first policy might let students have the freedom to get in touch with friends they don't see very often. It is also a good idea because then students will not get distracted in class. They will focus on their work instead of worrying about their phone or texting somebody in a different class. You would just have to monitor the students carefully during class so you were sure they were not using their phones.

I also think that you might want to go with 'Policy 2' because some students would still use their phone is class. They might use their phones to cheat during a test. f you used the second policy, then you probably wouldn't have to worry at all, unless people were still using their phones. Like I said before, you would still need to monitor students either way. Though, if people went into the bathroom to text, then I don't know what you should do then. Have people stay by the bathroom and make sure people don't take their phones in their with them? I have no clue what you should do for that.
