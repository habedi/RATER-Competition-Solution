Dear principal,

We have heard that you would like to change the school policy of allowing students to play sports only if they have a B average. I really think that this is a good idea. Some students just don't try because they think are big shots at sports, but if you make this the new policy all student will have to try in academics to be able to play the sports they love. It will bring up the school's GPA and will get more student to actually try in school. Maybe it will actually get people to think for themselves instead of following what other people do.

All those superficial football player, baseball players and cheerleaders will actually have to try if the want to stay on the their teams. They will have to study and pay attention during class. They will have to take time out to do homework. If they don't, they will never be able to play their favorite sports.

Our school's GPA isn't really to high. We don't have a lot of student like the other district schools. Our school is a town school so we only have as many kids as our town has. That wouldn't really matter if our town wasn't so superficial or if more kids cared about school. In our town people don't like coming to school. All they care about is "Jersey Shore" and what's in or out in fashion. That isn't what life's about. It's about getting as far as you can and doing great things. Maybe that would be the case if this school policy changes.

Most people get sidetracked into following what others do instead of thinking for themselves. This is not to be ment literally. When you go out with friends you really don't make time to do homework because you might get laughed at or mocked, so you just stay hushed and do your homework rushed later. If our schools policy was changed all students would have to make time to actually try and do homework. Hopefully it would be easier to stand up for yourself in what you want to do.

Having our school policy changed would not only bring up our entire school GPA but it would actually make people try in school. It would also probably give people more confidence to speak up for what they want to do. Not only would this be a great idea this would benefit everyone in our district.

Sincer
