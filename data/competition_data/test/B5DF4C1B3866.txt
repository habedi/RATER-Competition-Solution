I think that we should be able to play any sports we want even if are grades are at least a c average . Some students will most likely be getting a c or b . Most students like to be in a team because they like to play other schools .

One reason, students should be able to play any sports is because they like to have fun and its about that just to have fun with other schools and there friends . When you are playing a game of football you just like to see touch downs . The students just want to have fun every parent just wants to see there child win and so does the other parents . People for you want to see your son or daughter win a game like football or volley ball its not about a rival or a challenge for theme they are just having fun .

Secondly , your child wants to play in a sport in school but his or her grade point average is to low you would want theme to still want to play rite . Also what if they where already on the team then they're grade point average went down and you didn't now you would still want theme to play .

Third of all , they didnt tell you ther grade
