It was may 24,2001 I was working at NASA driving the viking 1 spacecraft over mars when all of a suden I see a face on the planet, was so shocked i couldnt believe it so i snaped 123 pictures of it to see if it was real and every picture turnd out the same so i ran down the hall to get my friend and when he saw the picture he just as shocked as i was.

and after starring at the picture for 36 minutes he says ''ALIENS MADE IT'' and i said no well we dont know wat it was i believe it was just a natural landform he says no it was aliens so i say lets take another picture,so my team and i used our viking 1s absolute maximum resolution camra and so snaped 1 more photo of the face and sent it to our scientest and 2 weeks pass and the scientest say its an natrual landform coused by a lava dome that bursted and caused the rockes to form a human like face and there was no alien like monument anywhere
