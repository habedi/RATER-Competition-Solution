using this technology to read the emotions of students in a class room is valuable because you can tell a lot if a student is confused or even to angry or to sad to learn. plus you can tell if the teacher is doing her job right or if the student feels confortable in the class room you can also learn if the student feels bullied or not safe in the class room. We could also tell if the student is acutally happy in the class because of the facial action coding system that even allows you to figure out if the student has a genuine or false smile stated in paragraph 8 of the text. This technology could help students to learn better, students that come from other country's and dont know how to speak for thereself or are just to shy to speak out. At last is the communication that the teacher and student can have through this device would be better since the device can read emotions the teacher can learn from all of her students on how they like to learn and how they dont like to learn.
