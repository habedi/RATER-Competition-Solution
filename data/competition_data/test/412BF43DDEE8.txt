It sounds insane to even suggest whether or not to impliment a new system of computers taht can identify the emotions of students in a classroom. However, this is not because of the idea of the software but the absurtidy of truly modifying the education system around each individual student at once. It is beyond beneficial to students to impliment this system, it is revolutionary. It may be the first time in all of history that education is able to acomidate every student in the class room and ensure their success. The Facial Action Coding System should be implimented into classrooms to read teh emotional expressions of students in order to ensure their greatest success and the furthur success of the school.

These computers do so much more than read what is on a students face. They are able to determine emotions that maybe the student is not aware of or denies. This can determine what the student really loves and are interested in. This could eliminate unwanted or unessisary classes that prove no benefit to the students future based on their interests. To be able to change the curriculum around every student is to maintain a steady growth of every person into what they truly want and deserve to me. If science is a field of much interest, it would be easily determined by small changes in facial movements. This could allow for students to identify fields to pursue, making it easier and more enjoyable in the classroom. To continue down a path of true passion is more beneficial to everyone in the situation. D'Alto refers to a simular idea, saying that "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow" (D'Alto 6). Like advertisement, students would be able to follow a steady stream of interest, insuring the best and more satisifying education possible. By being able to elimnate certain subjects or topic that peak no interest, students would find themselves more involved and more passionate about the subject rather than simply turning away from all subjects due to the poor outcome or little interest in one. It is astounding that lack in interest in one subject can turn a student away from school. The Facial Action Coding System would not only help students with their interests, but keep them from turning their backs on school completely.

Although the students are mainly in charge of their education, teaching style is also a large portion of how a student learns or does not. If a student is bored, confused, or uninterested, it could be how they are being taught. How one person learns is not universal. However, "the facial expressions for each emotion are universal" (D'Alto 4). If students were able to be placed with teachers who would acomodate them the best based on learning styles in cohesion with teaching styles based on the science behind their facial expressions, grades would be higher and students will have a higher sucess rate. It is not fair to blame a teacher for a students inablity to learn in their environment, however it is the responsiblity of the school to place a student in their space to learn. By being able to determine how a student reacts to certain moments in a class or activities, schools would be able to change their curriculum and place students with teachers who would most benefit. This technology would produce better outcomes for schools, creating a new system of aulmni that are more likely to succeed in their field and therefore more thankful and loving towards their previous school. To blame the student or the teacher for the lack of communication is unfair since "most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication" (D'Alto 6). To give students and teachers the opportunity to truly open up new possiblities of communication through technology is revolutionary because of the better relationships that would form if all involved are on the same page.

Many may argue that this technology takes away the part of humanity that is working with others who disagree. However, if humanity was able to perfect a system so that everyone was happier, would anyone truly disagree? Once out of school, if students were able to immediatly pursue a career in their interest and work with people who share this, they are again being placed in an environment best suited for them. This technology could not only eliminate unessisary classes or subjects but stress. If everyone was in pursuit of their passions, living their best lives, would anyone feel the need to aggresively brual or disaggree? This technology may not completely eradicate disaggrences, but it may eliminate unessisary arguments or issues. The Facial Action Coding System enables students to live and learn to their full potential while also benefitting teachers and schools. By enabling students to take charge of their education, success rates will reach unthinkable numbers.
