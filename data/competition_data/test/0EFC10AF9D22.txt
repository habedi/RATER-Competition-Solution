The use of technology to read the emotional exppressions of students in a classroom is valuablefor many reasons. Emotions are a strange thing, and not evryone is going undertsatnd you just based off of your looks. There is something called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that classifies our six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disqust,fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and they rely on the muscles in the face to expose it all. All of this came from the relaization that no one knows exactly the expression on the painting "The Mona Lisa"'s face.

Some have observed the face so much, they can just tell how you're feeling.

Like, in fact if someone close to me were feeling some type of way, I would be able to tell based off of their face expression unless it's "just their face".

Not everyone is the same because "most human contact and/or communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication" which is stated from the text. Technology has helped alot though in this, especially researchers, psychologists and most likely scientists.

In conclusion, The Mona Lisa painting face expression isn't unknown anylonger. A group of researchers, scientists and whoever else may it be got together to solve this mystery whether it be with a computer, or looking through books. And maybe through this I could pay more attention to face expressions since it's that easy.
