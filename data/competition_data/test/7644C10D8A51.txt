Dear principal,

I think that this new policy requiring a student to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities is very unfair. I think this is unfair because some kids can't get a B average because they aren't the greatest at school, but they're really good at sports and it's a relaxing time for them instead of being stressed out by school. I think if you're still going to go through with this, you should at least make it so that the student has to have a C average, because most kids have a C average and love to play sports. Also, this could offend some kids and they could think that they're not smart or something because they can't play a sport that their friends are playing. Or, they could feel left out, or loose some friends, because sports are very social and many people make new friends by playing sports and doing other activities. Sports and other activities can also determine their career for their life in the future. For example, if someone plays hockey now, it could mean that they want to be a professional hockey player. Or if someone is acting in the school play now, they could want to be an actor or actress when they grow up. At our school they do OTHER_NAME and if someone sings in that they could want to be a singer when they grow up. I think that if someone wants to do something, that their grades shouldn't hold them back from doing that. In conclusion, I think that this policy is very unfair, and I think that if someone wants to play a certain sport or sing or dance, that their grades shouldn't hold them back from doing what they want to do.

From,

STUDENT_NAME
