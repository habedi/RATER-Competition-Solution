Dear Senator,

I belive that we should get rid the electoral college. The electoral college help so much on deciding on who becomes elected for president.

For starters the electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established as seen in "What is the electoral college?" To be exact the electoral college is a process of 538 men and women from each state in the united states that  are chosen to represent their state. The amount of electors varies on the size and population of the state. Say California has a population of 2 million there will be more electors than Rhode Island if it had a population of 1 million. These electors vote for the president and the vice president. For the president to win the majority of the votes they need at least 270+ votes.

The electoral college we can do without. It is just 538 votes out of millions in the United States. I belive that all people should have is the election where everybody votes not another one of just 538 people. The majority of the people in the electoral college would also be esier to bribe than the whole country. Who picks the electors? It could be legislators that pick them only to opose one canidate like what happened in 1960 against John F. Kennedy. Also larger states have more say than a smaller state would have making the election in a way less reliable. I belive that each state if the electoral college is to be a thing should have 3 chosen representatives for  one president.

The only reason i see the electoral college working is if the vote comes to a 50% to a 50% tie. The electoral college should be a back up plan in case the vote is too close of a tie. A complete tie is amost impossible but if so the college would work perfectly if there was not an even amount of electors. Say 537 or 535 instead of 538 where the electoral college could be a tie aswell.

That is why i belive there should be no electoral college.
