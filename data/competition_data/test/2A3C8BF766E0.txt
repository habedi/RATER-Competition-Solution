Phones and driving

Most of today's population has a phone, which makes it hard for them not to be on their phone. Most people do everything with their phone in their hand. They could be watching tv and be scrolling down instagram, or they could be doing a simple task and their phone is in their hand. People have become so dependent with their phone that sometimes they take it to the extreme and drive while they are on their phone.

This is a major problem because drivers need to be aware of their surroundings. One of the main problems are texting and driving. This has led to many car accidents and many deaths. About 1.6 million car crashes occur every year (Teen Safe). In several states it's illegal to have your phone in your hand(Angela West, PCWorld). They have done this because the United States of America have called this an epidemic (Teen Safe). This is a epidemic because people are dying or getting hurt due to distracted driving.

If someone is conducting a vehicle their phone should be out of reach. People should consider pedestrians walking on the streets or the passengers in the car. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day (Association for Safe International Road Travel). These death causes are preventable, because it's not a disease or an illness. Texting and driving makes you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident (Driving Test).

To conclude, people should drive vehicles without their phone. This could prevent thousands to millions of deaths. When driving a vehicle people should be aware of who is in the car or their surroundings.
