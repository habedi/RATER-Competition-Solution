Kids these days want to have fun, hang out with their friends, go to the movies, and go to the mall shopping. On the other side kids also have things to do at home like clean their room, take care of their younger brothers or sisters, help their parents out, and their homework. Once in a while is never to bad to help out in the community. I think kids should be able to hang out with their friends and some days help out in the community. Make the kids sign up on a paper to do community service when the kids have time and if they cant or don't want to help the community people cant force them. Maybe the you can give out a prise to the kids that helped out maybe that way some kids would want to join and help. I think that you should let the kids that want to do community service do community service and the kids that don't want to do it well just let them not help out.
