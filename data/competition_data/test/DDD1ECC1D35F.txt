Life is all about exploring your strengths and weaknesses. Since the principal has decided for everyone to participate in an extracurricular activity, I have thought about the positives and negatives about this decision. I agree with the principal that students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it can help students be more confident in themselves, it can teach students a good work ethic, and it can show students how to better manage the personal time.

To begin with, students should be in an extracurricular activity so they can learn to be more confident in themselves. Some students, new or that have been at the school, can have a hard time searching for someone who they can relate with. Also, many student are shy and have a hard time going up to someone and have a conversation with them. With participating in an after school program, they can have a easier time socializing with someone. This can build their confidence to talk to people outside of the activity and make new in different ways. To bring my thoughts together, students can build new relationship and build up more confidence in themselves to do more.

My next point is, being in an after school program is helpful to teach students to have a good work ethic. A lot students have trouble being and staying on task. With joining an extracurricular activity they can learn ways and strategies to better handle their school work. Being in a program can also help them because it is hopefully something they enjoy participating in, so they will be more motivated to work harder and find way to get better. To sum it up, students will work more diligently and want to be better to create a better work ethic for themselves by doing something they love.

Finally, being in an extracurricular activity is helpful to students because it shows them how to better manage they own personal time. Every student, including me, has had times where they had a hard time trying to fit everything in at once. This can be a struggle throughout someones whole life. This is why students should have an after school activity to do, so they can learn how to manage their time from an early age. Being able to use your time is something that can takes you through life. To learn that skill from middle school can help you through high school and beyond. To conclude, student will know how to take care of their time and use it more efficiently from being apart of an extracurricular activity.

To make the big picture, students should be apart of an extracurricular activity because it can teach students how to manage their time, make students have a better work ethic, and help students to build up their confidence. Being in an after school activity should not be mandatory in the first place. It has countless benefits to it, so being in one should be one of the first things that comes to mind early in your life.
