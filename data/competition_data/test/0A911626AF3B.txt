In the story A Cowboy Who Rodethe Waves was a seagoing cowboy and he had helped people form world war 2 and that would of been the reason why I would join there program becuse they had helped people and he had also went across the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice.

The details from the article to support Luke's claims is in paragraph 4 Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips- the most of any seagoing cowboy.

It took about two weeks for Luke to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. They had helped the people by helping time feed there animals.

Then something bad happened Luke was talking about his report on a rainy night and then fell off a ladder and he couldn't work for a couple days becuse he had cracked his ribs.
