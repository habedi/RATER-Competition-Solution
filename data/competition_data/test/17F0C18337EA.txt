Extracurricular activities are a great out reach to many people. As a result, I believe that schools should have the rule, that each student should have to participate in one extracurricular activity throughout the year. This way kids can try new things, help the school and the community, and create new relationships. As school comes to an end, they will have gone out of there comfort zone and have tried something new.

One of the benefits of extra curricular activities is the ability to try new things, one of these options is sports, kids are allowed to choose from a plethora of sports from soccer, basketball, and many more. What is so significant about each sport is that it brings together kids through team bonding. On the other hand sports isn't the only team bonding activity, there is also theater. Theater is one of the few activities where students are allowed to preform and express themselves through art. Where each student is given a role that influences the play in some way. Another activity can be designing. Schools are very active when it comes to promoting their extracurricular activities, and one way they do this is through art. When doing designing students are able to promote other activities by creating posters or even designing the year book. Extracurricular activities can seem like a big hassle and not worth while but are a great way to introduce students to new things.

Extracurricular activities are not only good for trying new things, but are beneficial for the community and school. There are many ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, one is working for the city council. Working for the city council is a tough tasks. You help by participating and working with the City Board, where you can help make decisions for your community. Another activity is community service, community service is a great way to help you community out, from picking up trash to helping local people. One way you can help the school is by help building props for theater. This is a crucial role when it comes to theater, because you give a scene for the play to help make it come alive. The beneficial outcomes are great way to tie together the students to the school and the community.

But the most important things that extracurricular activities do, is bring people together. Sports is one of many where they bring people together through competition. Another is theater where they work together to create a work of art for our enjoyment, and helping the community, where they meet new people and help them with there needs. People may think extracurricular activities are not for everyone, but there are ways that it can help you try new things, help the school and community, and even create new relationships.
