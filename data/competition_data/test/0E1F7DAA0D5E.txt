the use of technology to read emotional expression of students in a classroom is not valuable . Its not valuable to read classmates emotions because its pointless plus if that were the case we should already be able to read minds .

In the text it states " we cant actually calculate their emotions". meaning it is possible but there is no purpose for it and Its weird on the creators point of veiw. the technology could give us the wrong sign of expression.

In the text it also states .."the facial expression for each of them are universal". Meaning that everyone is titled to their own emotion . why would you want to tamper with it for no reason. I don't think it would be reasonable for anything.

In conclusion The technology to read expressions of students are not valueable more like pointless or useless. every person has their own expressions and emotions. thats more like invading their privacy if you ask me . You can simply lookat the person's face to tell what kind of expresssion or emotions she/he is feeling.
