Have you ever stayed up so late trying to complete all of your homework? Have you ever stayed up trying to complete projects all due one day? Now, imagine your principle is forcing you to do another activity, causing you to lose more and more time and sleep. This can affect many student's conflicts, interests, and other issues such as homework and their grades. Why jam another thing into student's lives if they're already packed enough?

Many students already have many things going on in their lives. Appointments, club sports, family, where are they expected to fit another chunk of time? If the principle is forcing students to attend an extracurricular activity, it must be during school hours or else it will conflict with many possibly already scheduled events. However, if the principle decides to make the activities not apart of the school day, students would either be going to bed even later, or waking up even earlier. Sleep is a very important factor of your health, and it would not be fair at all to take it away from students. Some families go on an annual week-long trip. Although, you will always be missing a bunch of school, you will also be missing out on you activity, and that can stress someone out very easily.

Another issue with forced extracurricular activities, is there may not be an interesting activity for everyone. That it totally not fair to force a student to do something that they may not want to do. There is no issue in encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities, but if they don't find one that interests them, they shouldn't have to do it. If a student does not think they are good enough or do not want to participate, being forced can cause stress in their life. Stress is a serious issue that can lead to anxiety, depression, or possibly even suicide. That may sound extreme, but it does happen, and is not safe for any student to suffer from.

With all of the other issues listed previously, there still come more. Parents have to work to support their families. Whether they work from home, work at an office, or anywhere else, they aren't available all day, every day, to pick up/drop off their children. Knowing all the students that get picked up and dropped off from school in the car pickup line, this can become a school wide issue, regarding many of the student's parents. If they can't get there in time, then their students are left at school. When the students finally get home, they will most likely have a bunch of homework, a project, or studying they need to get done. Students stay up way too late doing their homework in the first place, imagine adding an hour to two hours later than that. If a student can not finish a project or their homework, their grades will plummet.

A required extracurricular activity can be detrimental to a student's life and mental health. This can impact their conflicts, interests, and other issues in their lives such as homework and grades. It would be so unfair to impose these activities into their already jam-packed lives.
