Dear

Principle,

I think students should do community service because it is a good thing to do. One thing students can do for the community is to tutor elementary school kids. So then they can be smart in their classes. Another act of community service is help senior citizens in their needs. The students also can pick up litter to help our environment. If every student in our school do this we can make Earth a better place to live on. So i think the you should make our school do community service!

I think everyone should at least do 1 hour of community service. Most people think community service is a waste of time but i think community service could make Earth clean and safer for kids to play. Its very important to do community service because it is active and u don't have to sit on the couch and watch T.V. all day long.
