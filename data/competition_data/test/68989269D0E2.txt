Dear Principal,

Cell phones allow us to talk to others from a distance, text each other messages, and used for pure entertainment. But are they really important enough to bring to school? Or do they cause more trouble than they are worth? Personally, I am siding with your second policy. cell phones should only be used for calls about transportation, whether you need to be picked up at a later time, bring a friend home, etc. But can't you use the school phone for that? Cell phones should be banned from school because they can get stolen, cause disruptions, and prevent learning.

First, cell phones are everything to teenagers these days. Some teenagers, however, may become jealous if one of their friends has a new shiny phone when their phone is all scratched up. Phones getting stolen is not an uncommon issue. Since the memory of a phone can be cleared, students are willing to get the next best thing, even if that means stealing it from a friend. Therefore, if students did not bring their phones to school, stealing is avoided and students can stay happy with the phones they have.

Next, when a student's phone rings, it causes quite a commotion. Disciplinary action is withheld and the student is left depressed and phoneless. However, the other students will be left laughing and the phone ringing is all they will discuss for the next few minutes rather than the day's lesson. Because this occurs daily with students, Policy 2 will make this disruption will no longer occur.

Lastly, students won't learn with cell phones at school because they are too tempting. I myself see students put there phone between there legs and text while the teacher isn't looking. Also when a phone goes off, all the students will be concentrated on is the ring rather than what the teacher is teaching.

In conclusion, students won't get their phones stolen, class disruptions will be a thing in the past, and student
