Join the Seagoing Cowboys! The Seagoing Cowboys are people who bring cattle overseas to help those in need. We can go to many places like Greece, China, Panama, and many other places. As you can see people need help all over the world. We are a multitude of generous people who just want to help. Also don't think of it as just work, think of it as a oppurtunity of an adventure and as maybe even being a hero to other. Imagine that!

You should join us because we can help the needy and we can even save lives. Don't think its all going to be hard boring work because we can all have fun and it will all pay off at the end! For an example we can pet horses and what other time will you get to do that, but thats not it, when we unload the horses we can play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and many other games. As you can see we can all have tons of fun! Just imagine going on oversea voyages and going all over the world! Best of all helping the people who need our help. That would be awesome!

Now you see all these great reasons to join us! We will do so much. You can get back home with the most amzing story for your family and friends! This organization impacted me so much, at first i was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank but now i am going on oversea voyages to different countries. Once i was just an ordinary man but now i am adventurous and happy. I am Luke Bomberger and these are the reasons why i want you to join us. I want you on the Seagoing Cowboys team! Now will you join us on a adventure of a lifetime?
