Dear Principal,

I think the students should do the community service. It will show that they actually care about their community. It will also show how much responsibility they have and how mature they are. The parents will be very grateful on what their kids are doing for the community. For example if they clean up all the trash around them, imagine how beautiful the community will look. Picking up all the litter is very important because some animals will mistake it for food and then they'll get sick and we don't want our wonderful animals dying because of how lazy some people are. We want to help the animals with a clean, healthy environment. This makes the kids look like they actually care about something important like this. Another example would be helping out the seniors at the senior center. I think the older people would love to have someone to talk to and spend a whole day with. The kids will take them for walks around the park, take them to lunch, and have just a wonderful day. Doing all this will make your students look really good and how much of a role model they can be to kids younger than them. I hope you really think about what your students could do for the entire community and how much of good help it would be. This would also look good on the students application for college. I'm sure in the end if you have them do community service people would love to have the extra help to make the community be a wonderful beautiful place.

Thank You,
