Dear Principal,

I agree with the policy changes that you've made. The students should get an average B. The reason why I'm agreeing with you is because students aren't concentrating in school as much are they are in sports, their always tired at school because their all worn out from their games, and the students always give excuses that they never have time to do their homework. The first reason is because the students always have too much on their mind that they don't concentrate enough on what's happening in school. If you can at least make them take a break in their spots then you will see the difference of how they act in school. The second reason is because they get tired from playing to much sports that sometimes they don't want to try in school, and sometimes they don't even go to school. If they can at least get a B in all their classes then that show their putting enough effort. My last reason is because the students don't put effort in their homework. Some students just copy off of other students because they don't get it, or they just don't feel like doing it. this is probably because their too tired from all their sports. This is why students should at least get a B in their classes, or it show that they don't put any effort and that they won't play any sports until they higher up their grades.

Sincerely, student
