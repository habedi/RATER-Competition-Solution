Hello I am Luke Bomberger and i'm going tell why you to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

The reason anybody wouldn't want to pass up the oppertunity like the Seagoing Cowboys is because it's a opportunity of a lifetime. The reason I say this because it opens up the world to you, it lets you see amazing things in other countrys. This program also allows you to help other people in the world because of war. It really doesn't hurt to help other people in the times of war. The Seagoing Cowboys also doesn't have you traveling alone on your missons, you have other people to travel with! There's things you can do with your crew mates that I did with my mates such as baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and more.

A few examples of the benefits of being a Seagoing Cowboy is sight-seeing. You can see famous structures from all over the world including the origanal Rome, the Statue of Liberty,and the great wall of China. Another reason to join is to make friends. I was already friends with of them, Don Reist but i've made more friends thanks to joining.
