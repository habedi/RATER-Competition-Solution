Every year lots of students take an extracurricular activities, sports, clubs, or student council are some just to name a few, but should the school forced you to take one? There are many reason why a student can or can't participate in an extracurricular activity. Sometimes things like home life, after school life, or maybe even school life can affect your ability to take an extracurricular activity.

For some students home life is just as or maybe even more important then their school life. Some students have the responsibly to look after their siblings. Not all parents can afford to send their kids to a daycare everyday, so they let the oldest sibling look after then well they are at work. A student could also be tasked with taking care of the house. Thing like mowing the lawn, cooking meals for the family, and clean up the house afterward can take a long time not leaving enough time for something like a sport. Last a student could be in a position where they can't drive to or from school everyday. When a student rides a bus to school somethings that is their only option and they can't depend on their parents to drive them to soccer practice. From taking care of sibling, cleaning the house, or even transportation problems students can have many reasons why they have to chose home life over an extracurricular activity.

When the last bell rings and you are home it's a student own time to do want you need, or want to do and some of that is more important than an extracurricular activity. Some students once they're old enough to get a job to earn money. With school taking so much time already that doesn't leave that much time to work, so once school is over students spend the rest of their day working at these jobs and not at a school club. School may be a student main way of learning things, but that doesn't mean it's the only. Many student take after school classes to learn something they're interested in that sometimes might not be able to learn at the school, so instead of an extracurricular activity at the school they go take their own classes somewhere else. Last students could just be hanging out with friends. Students have lives outside of school they hang out with their friends playing games, going to the mall, or just watching a movie these are all things school do outside of school other than just go home. Students live their own lives once the last bell rings like having a job, taking diffevent classes, or just hanging out at a mall, all things that an extracurricular activity would prevent.

A student main job in to get good grades in school, so when they need to get something done in school that becomes more important then an extracurricular activity. Everyday after school the first time you have to do is finish all your home work. Sometimes students can get a lot of homework to do, so they don't stay after school to do an extracurricular activity instead they go home to finish homework. If a student is struggling in school they might need to get some help. School is harder to some students than others, so these sometimes these students need to get help from a firend or teacher and that may make it so a student is not be able to attend the student council meeting that day. Last it could also be that a student needs to stay home to do a project, with or without a group, projects take a long time to do. Research, testing, and making the project can take all time and sometimes that mean that you can't particpate in an extracurricular activity. School is the most important piece of a kid's life and if having an extracurricular activity is affecting their school life in a negative way then the students shouldn't be particapting in an extracurricular activity.

I think that students shouldn't be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Student have lives outside of school that could get effected by having to participate in these activities. Students that have to watch siblings, clean, or cook from their family couldn't do so if they are forced to kick a ball in a game of soccer. Kids with tight jobs and after school classes would have to find a way reschedule thier activity that they already little time to do. Last student will have to find a way to keep up their education well also taking something like football. There are just too many students that use their time after school to keep up their lives that it's not a wise choice to force students to take an extracurricular activity.
