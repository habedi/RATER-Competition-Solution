Over the years pollution has increased drastically. "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an offical of Transportation for America (In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars P7)." In Vauban, Germany they have been developing a suburban community without cars. "70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars P3)." Limiting car usage has been changing the world.

A resident of Vauban, Heidrum Walters, a media trainer and mother of two said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars P3)." Without cars people are more at ease and relaxed. "Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separateÂ  suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning."( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without cars P4)."

Some people know that one of the main causes of pollution is from cars. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive ares in the United States (In German Suburbs, Lifes Goes On Without Cars)." Because of all the pollution Paris "After days of near-record pollution, has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city (Paris bans driving due to smog P10)." Pollution has been slowly decreasing from hybrid cars and other means of transportion.

In Bogota, Colombia they have also gotten into the spirit in reducing air pollution. "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota P20)." "It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota)." A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said "It's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air pollution" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife (Car-free day leaving is spinning into a big hit in Bogota)."

As more and more countries try to find new ways to reduce pollution good things are starting to happen all over the world. People are starting to feel less tension and stress. It's also another way for people all around the world to exercise, go outside and enjoy the beautiful blue sky with friends and family.
