Do you think students should have to do extracurricular activities? Because in my opinion I think not. It is quite unnecessary and uncalled for. And here is why, it cause a huge workload increase, less freedom for the kids and rides would be super difficult so the school might have to pay for transportation.

If students had to do an extracurricular activity do you think that all their school work would just go away? Because it wouldn't just disappear. Since it wouldn't go away the workload would increase by a lot, and that is honestly just uncalled for though, these kids get enough work. Also if you think about it in perspective the higher the workload the worse the grades, because you are causing the students to focus on different subjects and stuff. I'm sorry but I just disagree.

If you were to be given an extracurricular activity you would be given less time to spend your life as a kid. It takes more time and effort to do something extracurricular. So then you would be giving the kid less time to just be a kid. They would be all caught up in school that they wouldn't have time for video games or going to the park and hanging with friends. That's not what life is about. You're trying to teach these kids about life? Well that would an awful way to help your cause.

Not every kid is going to have a ride, so if the school would like to spend money on that then go ahead. But since most schools don't have the money for that they aren't going too. Lots of schools such as mine have a low budget. My principal won't spend money on anything and it is kind of sad. Also not every parents wants to leave work early to go get their kid, or maybe they're doing something at home.

So in conclusion I don't think students should have to do an extracurricular activity. It will cause a massive workload increase which is very unnecessary. It gives less freedom to the kid to just be a kid and you need to just be a kid sometimes to enjoy life. The schools are going to have to pay for a transportation method, because not all parents would like to leave work early to come get their kids or maybe they are sick that day.
