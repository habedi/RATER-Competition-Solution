Dear Principal,

I have now heard that you are considering banning cell phones from our school!

I say that you should let us have our phones but just let us use them during our lunch periods. Many kids really do rely on their phones so they can get to school and back without any problems.

If there is a problem any where in the school the kids are able to contact help.

If you do allow phones but only if they are turned off in class, I think we would rather have that than no phones at all. Many kids will turn them on anyway but them you could just take them up. I will personally turn mine off during class but only if there is an emergency.

Another reason we should have phones is because of parents. Parents are the reason most kids have cell phones anyway. If the parent works far away, it's is nice for them to know if their kid got home safely. I know that my mom would always like to know where I am at all times.

Phones will be turned on in class but if some do, you don't need to punish everyone else for that. I think that only the good kids should be allowed to have their phones during lunch but off in class. Many kid try to sneak a text in when our teachers aren't looking and I feel that is really an issue. A lot of kids aren't even learning much whenever they are too busy texting during class.

Please take my letter into consideration and think about what the students would want as a whole. We would like to have phones but we will only used them will allowed. Thank you for your time.
