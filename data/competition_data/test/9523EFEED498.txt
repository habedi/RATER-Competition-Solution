Students Decisions Can Lead to Greatness

Wait, teachers are the one's who decide what student's summer projects are? Believe it or not at most schools teachers are the one's who decide students summer projects. This is completely wrong and unjust because, teachers are not the one's who are doing the project it's the students, and therefor should be their decision on what they want to do. When teachers assign summer projects they are uninteresting to the students and do not correlated at all with students interests, which is essential if teachers expect the project to be good and finished by the end of summer.

Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student designed because, the project will be according to the student's interests and therefor motivate them to accomplish it, leading to future successes and the students will be able to have a choice of what they want to do rather than the teachers deciding for them, which will make them feel more independent and free.

It's important that summer projects are student designed to ensure for a better quality project from students along with a positive attitude while accomplishing.

The project will be according to the students interests and therefor motivate them to accomplish it, leading to a result beyond the teachers standard.

It is important that a summer project is according to the students interests to ensure for an overall higher quality project, completed by the time summer comes to an end. Take for instance Christian Benito, a famous Peruvian soccer player who played in the world cup. In an interview about his life before fame he stated that he realized his love for soccer while completing a school summer project, junior year at a high school in Peru. Because his project was a self designed essay based on his passion, he was motivated to accomplish it on time and even ended up reading the essay in front of his coach on live television. Another popular figure who was motivated to accomplish her self designed project is singer/songwriter Demi Lovato, who throughout her time in high school dealt with bullying and disorders. She never had the opportunity to express her feelings publicly but finally had the opportunity when she was given the choice of her topic for her summer project. She said she usually does not complete summer projects when they are teacher designed because they are boring but because she was able to chose her topic and presentation she enjoyed the project and was motivated to complete it on time, even going on to share the project about her high school experience with her worldwide fans.

TheÂ students will be able to have a choice of what they want to do rather than the teachers deciding for them, which will make them feel more independent and free.

Freedom is one of the most important things and is most important for students at school because it can lead to creative thinking and new ideas. An example of someone who was able to have a choice in what they wanted to do for their summer project rather than the teacher is my dad, Generic_Name, who instead of being tied to a specific topic or have to follow a specific guideline, for his art class summer project, was free to do what he wanted. His given responsibility made him feel more free and creative leading to his creation of an art piece beyond compare. His responsibility eventually payed off in the end when his project about art received the highest grade possible and ended up being pinned outside of his classroom for all the other students to admire. Another person who felt more independent and free when given the choice to design a summer project is my cousin, Generic_Name, who is currently 17 years old but was given the choice to design her own summer project for her English class her sophomore year of high school. Because she had the choice of what she wanted to do she told me she felt free because, she felt as if her teacher constantly made decisions for the class and was glad she was finally able to make one herself.

Some may say that summer projects should be teacher designed because if they are student designed, they will not meet the teachers standards and will be poorly done. Although this point is understandable, considering that some students may not try their hardest when given a choice for their assignment, it is wrong. Not only will students meet the teachers standard if the summer project is student designed, but go beyond the standard and ensure that it is a meaningful and A+ worthy project. For example when I had to complete a summer project for my English class last year, the design of the project was my choice which made me feel generally more relaxed and inspired. Because the assignment was up to me I took my time on making a children narrative that explained everything we learned in the year. My teacher was only expecting everyone to have a small project about simply one subject, but I exceeded that standard because I felt creative and had no limits to what I could accomplish.

Overall, in life it's important to understand that student's have options and freedom for what they want to do. When it comes to summer projects it is the student who is accomplishing the project not the teacher, which is why it is only fair that it be the students decision when it comes to the design of a summer project. If teachers were the one's who decided all of students summer projects this would lead to the destruction of students freedom and eventually result in poorly done summer assignments. In a perfect world, if summer assignments were completely student designed their would be a world of opportunity and creativity that would impact both the student and the teachers and maybe even the world. In the end it's not the teacher who should determine or limit a students success. Only the student's choice will determine their successes in life.
