I think that the new policy is un fair because many people struggle with grades and don't get much exercise out of school and the grade standards are to high.

first the average person is pacing all classes with b, c or ,a but having a b in every class is just to much what if a person has so many hopes of playing a sport and gets a c and has all a's that is not really fair or is it.

Some people don't exercise at home and they don't get inuf. that wont just affect your emotions of being sad but it well also affect your health and you might have a higher risk of getting diabetes or cholesterol.

last the standards are to high me i am trying to stay in wrestling and i am failing two classes and my highest one is a c it would be super hard to try and get all of them up to a b.

in conclusion i hope that i have convinced you about the new policy being fair and it is needed to stay the same for the well being of students
