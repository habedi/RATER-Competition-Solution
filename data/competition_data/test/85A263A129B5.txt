My Freshman year my class was assigned a summer project that our teachers put together to "prepare" us for Sophomore year. Most of us either ignored it completely or didn't do it until the last minute because we did not care or had no interest in what it was about. Summer is a time for fun and a break from school so the students will come back the next year excited. Vacations are usually a time period most people use to get away from their stressors and enjoy themselves. Students should design a project if they are expected to complete it over summer break.

One of the major reasons students should design a summer project is motivation. If the students design the assignment themselves they will always know in their heads they have something to complete before next year. Everyone is always thinking of the things they need done or have finished anywhere they are. When the students create the assignment before leaving for break, they will most likely remember there is an assignment that has to be completed before next year then lose the assignment given by the teacher. When a student designs the project it will motivate them to finish what they started helping them learn the material and also learn how to manage their time.

Another thing to consider is timing and pre-made plans. When the teacher creates a summer assignment they only think of themselves. When a student creates and designs the assignment they can base it around the things they have planned for the summer. Perhaps a students parents planned a family vacation during the Winter the student would have knowledge about the trip and can make the project about their break. If a student is going on a cruise or out of the country over the summer they can set up a unique project for the places they are going and have no chances of cheating or copying a friend.

Finally a thing to remember is if the student creates and designs the assignment they will most likely be excited about the topic. When someone talks about a thing they enjoy the person genuinely likes that topic and doesn't mind talking about it. When designing the project the students can base it upon the things they love rather than the teacher just throwing it at them and forcing them to do a project on a random thing. Relationships are a major part in everything, a student may not like the teacher assigning the assignment and may just not do it because of that. When the students create a project they will design it from something they want to learn more about which would make them learn during their break. Summer assignments should definitely not be teacher-designed because there is a less chance for success.

Summer assignment should always be designed by the students. Most people agree that summer is a time where you are taking a break from learning and work to relieve stress and focus on self care. If there is a project that has to be done to help the student continue learning over the summer it will not be effective. More than half of the students will use it to an advantage that it is during the summer and just cheat their way through it or just ask friends for answers. If the schools that assign summer projects allow the students to design the project their will be more effort put into it and the students will actually learn something.
