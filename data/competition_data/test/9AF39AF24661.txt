Cell phones are a huge part of society now. They are used everywhere and anywhere you go; school, home, to the store, park, mall and more. As a student i think that cell phones are important to have at school just in case of an emergency or even if you want to contact your parents.

Policy 1 is to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Policy 2 is to not let the students to have phones at school at all. In my opinion I think that policy 1 is a very appropriate rule. Lunch is a time where you can sit down chat with your friends, eat and if so, use your cell phone. I don't think that that's a distraction because they're so many people already talking about things, yelling, laughing, and more. You can also call your parents if you needed to ask about something. I know that I have to call my mom or dad a lot to get permission to go places and do things. If your phones are turned off in class they shouldn't be a problem because you won't be texting, playing on your phone, or it won't be making any sounds if you got a call or a text.

As for policy 2 i wouldn't want this rule to apply here at my school because i don't think that it is really necessary. They're are many good reasons for cell phones to be used here.
