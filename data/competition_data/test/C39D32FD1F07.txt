Dear Principal,

I think that you should consider the first policy to allow students to use phones at school during free time. The reason is and fact that even if you don't allow students to use phones they will eventually use them anytime. To make it easier and allowing the students to use phones will allow them to feel like they have more freedom and obey the rules, well at least I hope. Also using them at their launch and free time will be more convenient and they will be able to finish whatever business they have before or after class without the pressure of being caught. I, personally, don't really use my cell phone much. The only reason why I have a cell phone is one for emergencies such as when an earthquake happens, tornadoes, unlikely, flood, injuries, to tell my parent where I am, or many when I'm abducted but alien, that could happen. Secondly is that I'm close to going to high school, and that all of my friends are going to a different school then I am and I really would like to keep in contact with them. Other then that really, i don't care about the phone policy at all, but you really should consider the first choice since it's about my vote, it's about the other students vote so hear from them and not me, because my phone is always turned off, and stuffed in the side of my backpack. I also think that the others would enjoy the privilege of using their somewhat treasured cell phones, and if they take advantage of this privilege then go with the second choice , because I'm not supporting anything that going to interfere with my learning environment. So first you could try out the first policy and if it just doesn't work then try the second policy.
