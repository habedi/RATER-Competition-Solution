Students should be able to design their own summer projects. I believe that summer projects assigned should be student designed because it would be more freeing to the students if they got to design their own project for the summer instead of a project designed by a teacher. This is a good thing because it's their summer vacation and that should give them the right to decide what project they want to do so they don't feel like the school is control of them even during their summer vacation which often represents the idea of freedom until the next school year begins.

My reasoning on this is because it's the students vacation; it would be more fair to the student that they get to design what their project should be so they don't feel like the school is still in charge of them and what they do even while they're on break. I also don't think it would be fair to the teachers either if they were the ones who had to design a project for their students and eventually get bored of grading them because things could get repetitive depending on what the project would be. Some evidence I have for this reasoning is that I know some students that would be stressed out greatly from teachers designing what the students are going to work on over the summer during their vacation; it doesn't matter if the project is difficult or not because they would purely be stressed about the fact that they have a teacher designed project to do over the summer which feels more like schoolwork to do over the summer and that isn't a fun thing to be thinking about over your vacation.

I also feel that parents would have complaints to make if their child was being assigned to a summer vacation project that was designed by teachers because that would give them the idea that teachers aren't giving enough freedom to their child over the summer. Though if it was their child designing their project I feel like parents would be more supportive of that because not only is their child still learning during break; but with the student being the one to design the project; that means that it gets the students' creativity flowing which I believe parents would be more supportive of then if teachers were the ones to design the project.

While I do know that there would be students and parents who would prefer that teachers would design the projects so the students wouldn't have to think so much about it and just do the project like a lifeless mind slave; I would have to argue back that not only would that cause a block on the students creativity, which is very important, but it would also mean that teachers would have to design a project for all of their students, which is a lot mind you, while trying to make sure that the project would be fitting for each one of their students and I think that's a problem that comes back to the fact that it just wouldn't be fair for teachers to have to do that; especially because they would already be having to grade them; so with the teachers also designing the projects, like I said before, that has a risk of things getting repeated and that could cause the teacher annoyance, a headache, sleep deprivation, etc.

I think that if summer projects were to be assigned then students should be the ones designing them. It would boost their creativity as well as their learning because they would be designing the project and doing research for it, It would make the majority of parents happier if they knew that their child wasn't using their summer vacation for completing a project that was designed by a teacher and not their child, and the teachers would be less stressed as well knowing that the outcome of letting students design their summer project would result in more diversity between what the projects were about and would more than likely contain less repetition than they would if the teachers were to design the summer project. It makes more sense to me that the student would be the one designing what project they're going to do during their summer vacation.
