Do students benefit from attending classes at home? There are schools that offer distance learning as an option for students to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people say that it is better to attend classes at home, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students do not benefit from attending classes at home.

Attending classes at school positively impacts others. Going to school helps students meet new people that they otherwise would never meet. For example, they would meet counselors that help with their future, coaches who keep them on track with grades, teachers who want the best for them, and many more people who will influence their character.

Also, students can form connections with their teachers. If their teacher understands them personally, they can come up with better ways to help them learn. Furthermore, attending school provides a better opportunity for developing people skills. At home, the individual is not interacting with anyone; However, they are forced to interact with people at school.

In addition to affecting others, going to school impacts the individual. The student is given the opportunity to go somewhere instead of being stuck in the house in front of a computer. Moreover, going to school offers things that being at home does not. At school, students can join sports and clubs such as basketball or drama club. They learn how to work as a team as well as learning more about themselves and what interests them. Also, they gain experience. Students that attend classes at school get to experience different situations, environments, and relationships. Every classroom is a different learning environment and every friendship is unique. Schooling at home does not give them that experience.

Although some may disagree, students benefit from attending classes at school. They meet new people, form connections, develop people skills, and gain new experiences. There are people who believe that students benefit from taking online classes at home, but this is not true. In conclusion, students do not benefit from attending classes at home.
