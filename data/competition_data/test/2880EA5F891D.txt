Humans have a interesting way living in today`s society because we have advanced technology like cars. Just because people have cars the usage should still be limited. When it comes to limiting car usage people have lots of advantages.

To begin with, in the passage "in german suburb, llife goes on without cars" ms. rosenthal clearly states that 70% of Vauban`s families dont have cars. They think that this is less tense without one. But not only that. 5,500 residents within a rectanglar square mile may be the most advanced expirement iun low-car surburban life. even in "paris bans driving due to smog" they think the driving should be limited. the smog was intensive for five days. as a statement was said in passage three 'it is a good way to take away stress. so leaving that in mind it could still effect car usage positively.

secondly, in the last passage ms. rosenthal says "obamas gaol about the green house gas will be asisted so thats meaning the people will need to limit their car usage or he will. as a population the worlds usage is slowly but surely decreasing. in the passage it says americans couldnnt afford cars so that alont is assiting the limiting car usage. the numer of cars driven was 9% below nor so that was a huge win for the limiting car usage car usage should be be limited because of many reasons. so i propose a law to all of man kind that car usage should be limited for the better of the eniorment and for all people.
