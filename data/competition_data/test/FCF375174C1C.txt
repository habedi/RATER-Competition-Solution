Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. I think that these projects should be designed by the teacher. One reason why is because if the student are told to design it they are more than likely to not even do it. My second reason why is because some students might not know how to design their project. Reason three is that some students may design it themselves and make it so easy that they finish it in no time at all.

One reason why I believe the summer project should be designed by the teacher is because; if the students are told to design it they are more than likely to not even do it. So what is the point in telling someone to do something knowing that they are not even going to do it. Some of the students are going to be lazy and when they are told to design and complete a project they are going to say to themselves, "thats to much work." If the teacher designs the project and all they have to do is complete it the students are more likely to do the project. Some students are not going to do it weather the teacher designs it or they have to design it, however more students will do the project if they do not have to design it themselves.

Reason two why is because some students might not know how to design their project. The students head might flow with so many ideas that they do not know which to pick. The student may not even know what the teacher means by design the project. The student may not be able to think of anyway to design the project. Or more simply put the student may not have the means to be able to design, nor make it.

Reason three is that some students may design it themselves and make it so easy that they finish it in no time at all. I f the student gets to design the project they would figure out a way to make it so easy that they may finish it in a matter of days. If the student finishes the project in days how is the student going to continue learning for the rest of the summer. Even if the student doesn't make it easy on him/her self they still may finish quickly, however if the teacher designs the project he/she can make it more difficult for those who are smarter than some of the others. If the students get the project designed specifically for them it would take them more time which means they continue to learn all summer.

Those are my three reasons why I believe that the teacher should design the summer project and not the students. Reason one was because if the students are told to design the summer project they are more than likely not even going to do it at all. Reason two was because some students might know how to design their project. Reason three was because some students may design it to where it's so easy they finish it in no time at all.
