Policy Change Letter

Everybody has there own opinion on this concept , but I am definitely for not letting any children without a B average play in any after school activity or sport there may be .

I think to be able to play after school sports , or be in any after school activity is a privilege and needs to be earned . Its not fair to those who do all there work that others get to play without having to maintain good grades like they have. Also school should always come before any thing else because sure you can make a living playing sports when your older , but you always need to have a back up plan for when that doesn't work because no job is easy to find with out having an education .

So you see , yes children are going to complain and throw fits if you decide not to let them play without a B average , but its going to help them be more successful and its also going to teach them that things that they may want in life they have to work for .5
