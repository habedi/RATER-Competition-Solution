Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions and how easy is for humans identify emotions from another person face to face.

Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because is a new system that is been using with anatomical information to make it easy to identify every single people just looking at some exactly angles on their face. In the text it states, "...studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code." The text also states, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang. So comouters need to understand that, too." The text finally states, "The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for videogames or video surgery."

The coding that this new computers have his so amazing because demostrates how technology had been make and evolution in so many people and not only people also around the world. But this kind of techology also is not the best because it put your identity in danger because the emotions that you make the computer stores all the emotional expressions and maybe with the time another people will have or find access to this archives.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because have the carateristics that make it unique to identify emotionals expressions and that will be not possible if the help of science will not be there to support this new technology and give some advices to make this possible and valuable for the scientists and the people that are using it to take advantage or for something really helpful witch may be the case for some people that hide their emotions, this technology can be a treatment for them that can show they are not the only ones and with that problem and it is normal but they have to be happy with this new technology that can help them.
