To the principal,

I think that the proposed policy could have either positive or negative effects, depending on the determination of my fellow students on playing school sports/other activities. To begin, students who are more determined towards playing school sports or other activities may decide to study harder in order to participate, improving their overall grade and making this new policy worthwhile. On the other hand, students may be against it because they do not want to put in the extra work to raise their grade, causing a lack of team members.

First of all, this policy could be an outright success if every student that both plays school sports or other school-related activities and has a C or lower grade average decides to step it up and gets better grades. If this would happen, it would overall, make the school brighter. However, I do not think this is very likely, as there would be, most likely, at least one student who does not want to give the extra effort to play school activities.

However, if little to no students believe they should have to work harder just to play school activities, then this could mean a problem. Because many students do not already qualify for this future-policy, the teams would therefore be much less populated, and this could possibly lead to the teams not having the required amount of members, and thus the students who already meet these requirements would also be punished unfairly. This could then lead to an absence of school sports, and then the activity levels of the students could drastically decrease.

Furthermore, the proposed policy, in my opinion, should be a good idea for the overall benefit of the school, because I believe that most students are willing to improve themselves, if nothing else, for the sake of engaging in school sports or otherwise school-related activities. This is because higher grades could mean grants, and grants could perhaps mean equipment for those sport-players or those who partake in school activities.
