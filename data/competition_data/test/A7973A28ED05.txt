In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new use of technology called Facial Action Coding System (FACS), tells what emotions your using my theory of the FACS Is that It will work, but It's not telling the truth.

My theory Is that they are wasting all their time and money, and the FACS is not telling the truth the reason beaging Is you can never have a computer tell you your own emotions, also " If It Is some how ture about your emotions than you just got luckey for It to work but that's the only time It will work".

Another reason Is the time and money, who In their right mind would spend all there family time, and most of their hard earnd money on something that wouldn't work. To me I would rather sit at home whrn I'm done working and spend time with my family, and I wouldn't speed a penny on that sofeware that Is not granted to work.

Third of all what Is the stictist there Is none In the reading that I read so, judt why not get something up and running and, not put any stictist It Is dumb on their part.

In conclusion there Is nobody that Is going to change my mind about this soft wear working If It does then I'll chang my argument about It untill then It's not going to work, and that my opiotion.
