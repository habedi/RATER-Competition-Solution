Every Year, students of all ages reach summer break. Many of these students get excited to take time off of school and spend time with friends and family. However, as students get older, some schools require them to do summer projects to keep their mind active and engaged between the years. Teachers should choose these summer projects due to their understanding in education and experience they hold in life.

One reason why teachers should choose what the students should do over the summer is because they already know the subject. Most teachers have taught the class for a long time and know the objectives that will make the project useful. Even though students may know some information about the class, they still lack the skill of fully understanding the subject of a class they have never taken before. In fact, most teachers have gotten a degree in education. Teachers are required to go to college for years before they teach the subject. With the practice and skill they have required over the years, they are able to create worksheets and projects that help students learn.

Students are much younger than teachers and lack making smart choices when it comes to learning. Teachers have been around for a much longer time. They graduated school and have made the mistakes and learned to know what is the right solution on the amount of work a student should do over the summer. While students may be creative, they do not have a fully developed brain. Teachers understand the students are young and do not know how to design something so important by themselves. If teachers design projects, they will make sure that it will not be a waste of their time.

Some students will get very stressed about doing a project on a topic that they have no knowledge on. Many students have health issues that disable them from creating their own projects. Over the years, anxiety has increased into students' lives, especially teens. Many teachers have once been in the place of a stressful teen and know what its like to be in their place. Some may argue that students will have an easier time if they create the project themselves, but it will only create more stress for the student in the long run. If the school allows teachers to create the projects for the students, they will be able to ensure that the project will be stress free, fun and useful.

In conclusion, teachers should be the ones to create a summer project due to their fulfillment in education and experience. Teachers have been around for a lot longer and know what the students need and dont need in their curriculum. Their experience in life make it easier to understand what its like to be a student wanting a relaxing summer break. Teachers will know not to go too far on their students like some may do to themselves. While students may want to take the matter in their own hands, teachers are the ones that have the ability to make it stress free and useful for the future. Therefore, teachers are better equipped for the role of creating a summer project.
