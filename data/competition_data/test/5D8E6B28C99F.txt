Many schools have begun to offer distance learning as a way for students to attend classes from home by using online resources and video conferences. These online classes offer more ways for students to learn, and they are a more accessible option for many parents and students. In this day and age, many students participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports, volunteer work, clubs, etc. with all of these activities going on in an average student's life, they lose time for both homework and their friends. Distance learning programs can help fix this problem by allowing students to learn on their own schedule and not having to travel so much between school and their other activities.

Students would benefit from distance learning, as it would help students manage their time more effectively and leave more time for other activities.

As a student, I participate in a few extracurricular activities, it is practically a necessity to get into a good college these days. I play two different sports and work a job at a local fast food chain, between practice and work, I typically only have a 1-2 hours a day to focus on anything other than school, work, or practice. On days where I have a sports game or an important test to prepare for, those 1-2 hours are non-existent. I am one of many students who experience this problem, and I believe distance learning can help combat this issue. With distance learning, I won't have to waste an hour or two of my day by traveling between school and my other activities. Plus, maintaining a good sleep schedule would be much easier, as more time would be available to sleep, therefore making it easier to learn by not being so tired constantly. Simply put, by offering distance learning, managing time and sleep becomes much easier to do, and with that come the benefits of being more focused when it is time to learn.

Distance learning also allows students to set a manageable schedule of their learning. In the current classroom environment, everyone has to go at the same pace as everyone else. If the subject comes very easy to an individual, than he will quickly find himself bored and tired in that class. On the other hand, if it is a very difficult subject for him, he won't be able to comprehend the important concepts in the same time frameÂ of a student who is good at that subject. With prerecorded lectures and the ability to schedule as many classes as one thinks they need on a subject, students can set their own pace for learning and learn a lot more effectively. It is extremely important that everyone gets an education, but some may need more time or help than others, distance learning is part of the solution to this problem.

Some people may argue that students can not be trusted with the ability to set there own schedule and that many will just stop scheduling classes and learning all together. I disagree, many students hate coming to school, but will still skip classes even knowing the consequences that it will bring in the future. It is because some students dread coming to school so much that distance learning would work for them. With the help of a counselor to help work out an effective plan for learning, kids won't dread school so much, because they can now learn from home in a comfortable environment at their own pace.

That is why distance learning is a great program that should be encouraged throughout school systems. It allows students to manage their time much easier, provides better pacing for learning, and creates a comfortable environment for students. Some may abuse the ability of not having to actually show up at a designated location for class, but students skip class anyways in a regular classroom environment, and distance learning will help reduce that problem if anything. That is why I believe it is a good idea for all schools to start assimilating distance learning, at least to some extent, into their education systems.
