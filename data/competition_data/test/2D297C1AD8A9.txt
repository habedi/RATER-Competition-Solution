New cars, that can control themselves ,are being manufactured in the United states. The driverless cars have censors that can tell the vehicle when to move forward or stop moving . In the passage it says "Google has had cars that could drive independently since 2009" and the cars are still being worked on to this day. A human must still be presant so they can take over and drive if the car needs to park or is having trouble in traffic. This new driverless car is still rather new and I think it puts people in danger.

Imagine if this self moving car has a mess up or is a little damaged and it goes out of control. The human inside the car might not be paying enough attention to realize the car needs help. I believe that if you were to allow people to have a self driving car they would eventually lose the feeling of responsibility . Although the car is able to drive to certain places, due to its computer programming, people might over look that they still must be focased and ready to drive.

The new cars will notify you if it needs you to take over. This is helpful but still a large risk . Censors do have the ability to mess up and cause crashes. I dont see why they are trusted. In the article "driverless cars are coming" it states "if technology fails and somone is injured , who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer." this only adds to my point of lack of saftey. How is one sipposed to know if it was their fault or the manufacturers .

I think it is not safe to have cars attempt to control themselves . There are so many times when they could glitch and kill people. I am against the idea of driverless cars.
