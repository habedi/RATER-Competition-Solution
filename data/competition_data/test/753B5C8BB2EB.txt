Cars should be limited due to the polution of the air that the car brings. Most cars run on gas so they will have a engine and the smoke that comes out of the exhuast pipe polutes the air and makes it bad for peoples health.

In Germany its many people that dont have cars and some have given up their cars. Parking places have been took away from the peple with vehicles, and the Vauban's streets are completely car free. Many people are now walking on side walks other than driving cars. Some homes dont have driveways or even street parkings. Cars are not something that you would see when you go to Germany. You would see many people walking on a sidewalk before you see a vehicle. Many families there dont even own a car. Many people sold their cars just to move to Germany.

It has been a record of pullotion from motor vehicles. Their are days were you have to leave your cars at home. If you were to drive on that day then you would have to pay a fine and even get your car took or impounded. There were about 4000 people that were fined and twenty seven got their cars impounded. Even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home and if not they would suffer a 31 dollar fine and the same would apply to odd numbered plates the next day.
