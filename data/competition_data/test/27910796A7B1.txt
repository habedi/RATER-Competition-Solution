Summer break, the break every student looks forward to. No school meaning sleeping in, no school work, late nights out, more adventures, but also forgetting most of what they learned in school. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break but, they do not know if these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Although teachers have the best interests, if the students designed their own projects they could come to an agreement on what their projects would consist of. Students should be able to chose their own project design because it is likely the project will take up most of their summer and with this in mind they should also be having fun.

Firstly, the students can come to an agreement of what each of their projects will consist of or if it is an individual design they can use their own creativity to design a project. By doing so there is a more likely chance the students will get their projects done. They wouldn't have to nag about doing something they have no interest in doing. These students would be able to express their interests in an academic way making the project easy to handle.

Another thing to consider is, this project will most likely be worked on most of their break. During summer break a lot of traveling is done. If the student is aware they will be traveling they could chose to base their project on where they might be traveling. While a teacher might have the projects include items some students might not have access to, with the student's design they would be able to work with what they have. The students should not have to stress about getting the project done, rather having fun with it while on break.

Lastly, the students should be able to have fun with this since it is their summer break. They could push themselves to try something new. Just how in the fifth grade science fair each student choose what their experiment was going to be. The kids had fun with the volcano explosion while learning that mixing baking soda and vinegar would make a bubbly explosion. They have fun while learning and who knows they might even find a new hobby.

No student should have to worry about a school project during their peaceful summer break. On the other hand some schools worry that the students will forget what they learned or stop learning through out summer break. They have now required students to complete a summer project. Should this project be teacher-designed or student-designed? Students should be able to chose how they spend the majority of their summer break especially if its going to be academically.
