Imagine, your principal tell you that we will have one extra activity in school. I agree because having extra activity is more good. Because students will stay healthy,learn more,and do something they are interstate in. for example,sports,art,science. Also students will love to come to school because they love different activities.

First,By give students activity is healthy because scholars will not get bore by jest seating in one class. For example, some pupil gets bore be seating like one hour in one class. Also extra activity make students feel more happy. because,by going to one class and other and walking and not seat all the time make them happy. And being happy in school it every thing students need in school. Also,by giving them extra activity scholars will have more energy in school. Because taking extra activity is more en joyful for students. And students get more energy by going to one class to another like walking give them people a lots of energy.

father more,By giving scholars extra activity students can learn more. Because one extra activity can help them now how other activity are and how to learn that activity. Also,giving extra activity will help them know what activity they like. And it will make students do good at another things too. Learning new things in life is important for everyone. For example,you take activity about sport and later in life you sign in a collage you will win because you all ready take activity about sport. extra activity can help students anywhere in life. Also,extra activity can makes life easy and you will have a great job because of activity and you can have different job too.

Finally, extra activity can make you in different interstate's things. Also, extra activity can make scholars do something they are interstates in. For example,sport,art,and life science the things students can choose on of the activity. And one extra activity can make there dream come true. For example,i love to play soccer and i take activity about sport and it make my dream become true because i wanted to become the best soccer player. And even it i was not interstate in sport activity help me to become interstates in it. For example, i was not interstate in art but when i take the activity i become interstate in art and know i love it. So extra activities can show me what i am interstate in for example,some students do not like sports and when they take extra activity they start full in love with it.

clearly, i agree that students should have extra activity because it will make students stay healthy like make them feel happy. Also,extra activity will make them learn more fast like different thing that they never try. And it can make them interstate in different things and they can make there dream become true what ever they wanted to be. So, you should take extra activity in school to make your life easier.
