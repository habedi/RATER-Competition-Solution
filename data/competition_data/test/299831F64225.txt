I think we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. This is because phones are used for communicating with others who are not around for us to talk to we like using our phones to talk with our friends during school all the time so we should at least be able to talk to them at some time during school because school is to make new friends and learn

I understand that talking or texting on the phone during class is bad but we shouldn't be prohibited from bringing our phones to school because many bad things can happen when you cant contact someone for something that has happened to you such as getting lost or having an injury but cant get help from anyone also talking or texting through your phone is a way to know people more better or talk in private so that no one has to disturb you or listen to what you are say to that person so i think that your policy 1 is a better choice for the school
