Ching Ching! This is the sound you might hear more and more as our world starts to rely less on outomobles. There are some advantages to this, there will be less air polution, less fossil fuels being burned, and less accidents. As with everything, there are always two sides of the arguement too.

First, there will be less polution because there will be less, or no automobles creating it. cars contribute 12 percent of the Earth's greenhouse gasses. Other countries have begun setting days that people can't drive becasue the polution gas gotten so substantial.

Another reason it would be helpful to use automobles less is because the majority of them burn fossil fuels to make them run, and this is devistating our worlds fuel supply. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, and if we burn up all of it that we have, we will never have it agin.

Last, there will be less accident, which will result to less people getting injured or worse. There are so many automobile accident every year, if we cut them out of out society, the accident rate would be decreassed substansally.

In conclusion, there are many different reasons why getting rid of cars would be a positive movement for our society. It would reduce pollution, accidents, and the burrning of fossil fuels.
