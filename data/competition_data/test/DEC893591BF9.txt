The author in this story has a totally different persepective on studying Venus than most people probably would. He tries not to focus on the negatives since we all know that it's humanly impossible to step foot on Venus. He feels that hummanity shouldn't just give up on the mission forvever becasue it's dangerous and we have doubts on the mission. He looks at it as motivation and a challenge, rather than impossible. You never know what we could discover there so it's always good to have a strong imagination even if people think you're crazy, because those people change the world.

NASA is still looking into this research. They understand that they can't send humans to the planet, but they have a plan to send scientists in space to float above Venus and do their research from up there. Obviously their information wouldn't be as valid from being up above the planet rather than being on the planet, but it's the closest they can get to this day. In the future they hope to be able to create technology and machinery that is strong enough to withstand the preasure and heat from the burning planet. Resaerchers believe that long ago Venus was a lot like Earth, and was covered with a lot of similar features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This planet is looked at as Earth's twin, and long ago was once covered with large bodies of water and was able to support life just like Earth. That's why they want to keep learning about the planet becasue of how similar it really is to our own.

In the end, I think that with the way NASA's technology is adavancing, they will soon one day create a device that can gather information from Venus and send it back here. They have been testing electronics made of silcon carbide and placing them in Venus like conditions. Over time, they are slowly able to start lasting longer. This shows that they're only going to get smarter and keep advancing over the years. It is probably going to take some time but in my eyes I dont think I see humans ever going there, but I do see AI making the trip up there eventually.
