Its is helping the people and the animals from cities in world war 2 . The UNRRA (united nations relief and rehabilitation administration).hired "Seagiong cowboys". they would go to places all around the world to take care of animals shipped over seas.

In august 1945 they, luke and don, recieved orders to go to New Oleans. they arrived on august 14th. The day the pacific war ended. They got thier papers and borded the SS Charles W.Wooster, headed for greece with a cargo of 335horses plus all of thier food.

They could also see alot of places like Eruope and China. They also saw the acropolis in Greece but caring for the animals kept luke busy for a while. They had to be feed and water 2 to 3 times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned to so they needed help.

The program was a great way to help the people and the animals. We probably wouldnt have as many animals if the seagiong cowboys didnt help. Thats why they need you to join. Its very benificial and you can see places you have never seen before its also a great way to make friends since youre stuck on a ship for days you can get to now them just like luke and don.

In paragraph 5,6,7,8 you can see why luke joined. He tryed something new and liked it . He had a fun time seeing all the places and helping the animals .

Helping on the fram, did probably helped too.

God new what was going to happen in luke life and God was there every step of the wayeven though luke could of died that day he slipped and fell god saved him and he only had some cracked ribs.
