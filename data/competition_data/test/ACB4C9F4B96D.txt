Some schools require students to complete projects over summer to assure they continue learning during the break. The school is thinking of adopting that rule and the principal is trying to decide if these summer projects should be designed by teachers or students. It would be best if the principal made these projects designed by teachers in order to make sure the projects are decently sized, factually correct, informative, and easy to understand and grade.

Some people say that if students were to make the projects, the projects would be kept at a good size because the students know better than everyone else what would be a fair, challenging project and the teachers would make the project overly long or short. However, since teachers are designing the project, they will focus on making the project not overly large because making a longer project means more grading for the teachers, while also not making a overly brief project because it will fail to keep the students learning and informed over summer break. If the students were to make the project they might feel compelled to make the project short and easy for the sake of less work.

Since the teachers are well informed on the subjects of the projects and know what the students need to learn or retain over summer break, they would be the best choice to make a project that is factually correct and informative. If students were to design these projects, they would be a greater chance of factual or grammatical error in the project, which is really damaging and will be hard for the teacher to reteach and correct.

The teacher is in charge of giving out grades to students and will format their assignments and projects so they are easy to grade. If the students were to create the summer projects, the teachers would have to figure out a rubric to grade the projects and judge how much the project should weigh on the students' grade, which can take quiet a bit compared to if the teachers just made the projects themselves.

The teachers are better at making sure the project for many reasons: they are better at formatting, they make less errors, and they'll make the project meatier than a student would. Think about this; what if you were assigned a summer project for science that was intended to keep you well informed, but was overly brief, wasn't as well formatted as it could have been, had a confusing or nonexistent rubric, and had potential factual or grammatical errors. Would you want the students to make the project for the sole reason that they're students or would you take the paid, professional teacher? In short, the principal should make the summer projects designed by teachers.
