Dear Principal,

I think that you should go with policy one because this policy will allow students to enjoy there free time and have more attention during class.

I think that the students will like that policy more and will respect you and other staff that enforce phone policy.

Me as a student do not use my phone during the day but the students that do end up getting in trouble by the teacher, they end up doing bad because they are not paying attention, and they become angry when the teacher takes their phone away.

I would very much appreciate you considering my proposal for you trying to use policy one over policy two.

A few other reasons why I conceive that you should use policy number one is because policy number two will not change at all when kids use their phones at school, this will just keep repeating the same policy on the students and the students will not like the fact that you considered letting them use their phones and then denied them that choice. The students will like their teachers and their authorities, like yourself, a lot more if you give them the choice to use their phones at school at non-educational breaks during the day like lunch and passing period.

Now you might have to warn them about getting to class late because they are using their phones, and if that happens too much than you should warn them and then move to policy two until they earn their intellectuality to show up to class on time.

Thank you for listening to what I had to say on the subject of allowing phones to be used at school.

I hope that you enjoyed hearing what I had to say on the subject and will scrutinize my proposition.
