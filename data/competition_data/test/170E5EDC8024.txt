Dear principle ,

I believe that students should be allowed to have lower than a B average to participate in sports and other activities. Sports are important to athletic students. Maintaining a B average and the stress of sports is very hard. Perhaps it shall not be much lower than a B but a high C. Anything lower than a 85 should not be participating in any activity. I believe you should not continue with the procedures you are making because a students deals with the stress of grades and also an activity they're participating in. Academics and activities may be overwhelming if a student has too much of the other.

I suggest that if a student has great talent in the activity they're participating in has a low grade , a teacher or coach should warn them and give them some time to get their grades higher before they are kicked off a team/club. This will warn a student and let them know to excel in academics but not just in sports. Hopefully with these procedures this will help your school to a better place , with better academically grades and better . Considering this idea may help your school , students , teachers , and also you.

Sincerely ,

Your student , STUDENT_NAME.
