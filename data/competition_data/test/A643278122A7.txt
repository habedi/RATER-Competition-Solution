I have just gotten the news that the principle is making everyone participate in a extracurricular activity. I disagree with the principal,I will give you some some reason why you should disagree with the principal making all students participate in a extracurricular activity.

First reason why you should disagree is you're being forced to do it. I feel like you shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity because when you're going to school you should have a choice not just be forced to do something. I think by being forced to do a extracurricular activity would make people not want to come to the school.

second reason you should disagree grades. The grades will drop because there forcing everyone to do an extracurricular activity so there will be little time to study. Do you want your grades to fall then don't listen to the principal.

The third reason why you should disagree team numbers. Team numbers is going to make our teams to big for our coaches and teachers to handle. an example is for the football team what if the football team already had 30 but with the new rule the is going to be 55 that way to many students for the coaches to handle.

I think this rule shouldn't happen because there to many failures thats going to happen. here are some reasons why you shouldn't do this rule.
