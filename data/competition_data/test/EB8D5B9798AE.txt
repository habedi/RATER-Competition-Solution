Schools that have a summer project that students need to complete must be teacher-designed.

Teachers have worked with their students for the year and they know what subjects they struggle on. They can design the project in a manner that would help the student remember information and teach them the subjects they had trouble with. Even though a student-designed project could also help, Students will choose something that they excelled at. It would not help them remember the other information they were taught that same year.

These projects could help students remember past subjects they learned that carried over to the next year. Furthermore, they can be built in a manner that can teach and remind students on the important subjects.

Students are much less likely to forget the information they learned if they practice it repetitively.

The project can also help encourage better study habits. A student who never studies can learn the importance of studying though the project. Additionally, it could encourage and motivate students to study after realizing how much it helps to study. Grades could rise and students will be happier.

in conclusion, most students dont learn at the same pace. They need practice to remember what they learn and to completely understand what is being asked of them. Student-designed projects would not help, because students would just practice something they're already good at. Teacher-designed projects can help remembering and can encourage better study habits, for students who can always learn more.
