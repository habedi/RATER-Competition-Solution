Dear TEACHER_NAME,

January 24, 2011

I think it is a really good thing to do community service. We all need to know how much we will be working when we get older. I also think that we need to know how much time we are needed when we get older and get a job. Like lets say I work at church and babysit little kids, I think we could use how to babysit and stuff. We all need to learn how to work in the city, and also like how we should behave in a real job. And when we go do stuff like at school, then we could be helping out with what they need us to help them with. But my opinion is think there should be less hours and credits than what we have to do. But every once in a while I think we should really know how to do all the community hours. The people who think they don` t have time to do the community service, they won` t be as successful in life than the ones doing the community service.
