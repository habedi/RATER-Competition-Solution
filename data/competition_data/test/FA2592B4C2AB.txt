Dear principal, you have recently decided to change the policy for school sports, and that has upset many students. I understand your logic in changing the rule but would like to ask you to reconsider. Sport contribute to the lives of many students , and help them develop social skills. I know your logic for changing the rule is so that the students will get better grades, but what if a C is the best they can do? There are many student that can't make a B even when they are trying their best. If you tell a hardworking student that they can't play sports because of their grades they will begin to work less. Some students might take offence in the fact that they were trying their best and you said they could not play sports anymore.

Some students might use sports as a way to escape a bad home life. Others might use it to help with anger problems. Sports means so much to so many people that if you take it away from them just because they have a C they will feel as if they lost a part of themselves.

If you are worried about students grades falling just remind them that you want a C or better. If a C is the best you can do then you shouldn't be punished for that. Students need to be reminded that if they do their best they will be reworded. One of those rewards is letting them play sports even when they have a C.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I hope you will take this into consideration before you change the rule.

Respectful, STUDENT_NAME
