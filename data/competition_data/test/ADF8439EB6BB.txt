How challenging it is exploring venus? Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. on other planets surface temperatures are way to high they are over 800 degrees which is really bad for human being to be up there. Taking electronics up to thoes plants would melt them.

In Vensus the teampeture is really high and it most likely human being or anything thing in general could live up there because of how high the teampeture is which is 800 degrees. NASA workers are studying Venus but they cant really work on it because anything that lands in Venus will just melt because of how hot it is up there. Nobody has gone up there in three decades. Earth is sometimes closer to mar and sometimes closer to Vensus depending on how fast they are going. NASA is working on something to last longer up there instead of melting so they can get more information on whts going up their instead of sending people out there and dying just to get information back.

The atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than what we are used to on our planet.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The most challenging part is that the clouds of high corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere.

I strongly belive that they shouln't really be worried about Venus because we already know a little bit about it and we already know we arre not gonna be able to grow stuff up their or be able to live up their so NASA shouldn't be foucs in that. So how challenging is it to explore vensus?
