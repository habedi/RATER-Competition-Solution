Although cars are an important piece of human technology, they can also be pretty bad. Cars harm the environment, and a polluted environment can harm us.

According to source 1, 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are from passenger cars. In America, there can be up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions because there are a lot of people that own cars. An advantage of limiting car usage would definitely be decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases. Also in source 1, a German suburb had entirely banned cars. One person even mentioned how much happier they were since moving to a community without cars.

In source 2, the auther discusses how Paris banned cars for several days due to the amount of pollution. The source even states that the smog rivaled that of Beijing, China. Beijing is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Unfortunately, simply banning something does not stop people from doing it. So, in order to make sure people did as they were told, Parisians were fined 22 euros, which is thirty-one American dollars. To make things simplier for people, public transit was free of charge.

Similarly to Paris, Bogota, Columbia has one day where everyone goes car-free. As stated earlier, not everyone follows the rules when it comes to things simply being banned. According to source 3, violators in Bogota face twenty-five dollar fines. Thanks to the one car-free day in Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built. To a lot of people, use of cars damages the environment, so days where everyone goes car-free really do matter and should not be pushed aside as unimportant.

Limiting car usage would certainly decrease the amount of pollution in the atmosphere and other parts of the environment, even if only a little bit. Because of cars, pollution is a serious issue these days and if we don't do something about it soon, it might be too late to try to fix it.
