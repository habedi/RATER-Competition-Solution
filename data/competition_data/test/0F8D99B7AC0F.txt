Dear , TEACHER_NAME

I think that all of the students should not have to do community service. I would love to go on my spare time to go and volunteer at elementary schools and to go pick up trash but i don't think that community service is for everyone. Middle school students have a lot to do on the weekdays and on the weekends .For example ,during the week students have homework to do in some of their classes ,and then they have extra activities to do outside of school so they really don't have time to do community service. On some Friday's i have girl scout meetings that i need to go to and then i have to do other stuff with my family on Saturday and on Sunday. What i think that you should do is to put up a sign up sheet for the students that are interested in that kind of stuff and they have time to go and do it. I think that you would get a great response if you did that .
