I do agree with the principal making every student do a extracurricular activity. Because its a way for them to make new friends that have the same interest. Also they could find a new talent or a hidden talent from taking pictures for the year book. You could also become in a club because of the activity that your doing.

If your doing a sport its a great way the get exercise. Like if you did soccer you could get better with your running skills. Also if you did basketball you can use your body more witch causes you to get strong. If you do play a sport and your stress you can let it go when you play like you can shoot the basketball or you can kick the soccer ball. You also make new friends that become like a family.

Student council is fun you get to do lots of stuff with your school. Like you can make posters and hang them around your school that say ice cream social in one day. You can also make a poster about you running to be school president. If you get voted to be president you have to go to SCA meetings were you plan events to happen for the school and more.

The school yearbook is cool. Because you can take pictures of the school and students. You get to design the year book and the cover for the book. You can also take funny pictures of your friends and put them on the yearbook. It also can be a awesome memory when you get older.

Thats why I agree with the principal. Its a great way to make new friends and to let out stress so you can have a good time and enjoy the rest of your school year.
