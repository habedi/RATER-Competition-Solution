Students strongly benefit from attending classes at home. Online and video classes help students learn at their own pace with the best environment. Attending classes at home helps students learn better and more efficiently due to the good environment and online availability, and detailed experience which ultimately helps to attain better grades.

Usually this is the case for students when they are taught at home but not always. Some students learn better in a physical environment rather than a digital one. There are students that require physical lectures in person to fully understand the topic, where as there are some that do not. Homeschooling can also be detrimental to the student because they might feel too comfortable in their own home and choose to not learn the material. A student might use the online availability to their advantage and cheat in schoolwork. Also the environment at home for students may be worse than at school. Schooling in person is better for some students and schooling from home is better for others.

Students grades increase once they take classes online rather than in person. This is because they have a more in depth experience with the teacher. Learning becomes more detailed in online classes due to the teacher being able to give a "one-on-one" experience to the student. This experience allows the student to learn the topics with more efficiency with the teachers undivided attention. When the student understands the topic better by learning efficiently it leads to better test and quiz scores which results in better grades. The student can learn at their own pace if the explanation is more detailed rather than moving at the pace of te class or the other classes. A detailed experience with the teacher makes the student feel more comfortable with teacher and not afraid to ask questions to understand the topic better. Online classes may also create a better student and teacher relationship where the student can feel more comfortable learning. Learning online helps the student increase their grades by honing the relationship with the teacher and the detailed experience.

The feeling of being at home while learning contributes to the student. Students may feel that school makes them uncomfortable but will still be subjected to going. While schooling from home, a student is not obliged to leave the comfort of their own home to learn. This makes it so students who are subject to bullying and other forms of harassment do not have to face these things unwillingly. While learning at home the amount of sleep will be greater due to online classes being less strict on attendance.

Once students get more sleep learning becomes easier.

Attending classes at home makes students better at various tasks and help increase their grades. The online availability of being able to search for topics they do not understand while learning and the descriptive learning style helps the student. Students learning at their own pace with more comfortable environment while attaining a more in depth look at topics makes the student well versed in the subjects they are studying and attaining better grades.
