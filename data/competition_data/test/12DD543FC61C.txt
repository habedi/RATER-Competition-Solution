Everyday fatalities happen from the use cell phones while driving. Research shows cell phones are a great factor in accidents. Research says a cell phone put a driver at a greater risk of a crash. Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to text snap call etc. Also, they believe that hand-free set is safe because they can drive and not focus on the cell phone. However, they say that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support cell phones usage while driving, there are cases that they are dangerous, and people should avoid talking while driving.

Some people whose work rely on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Some business issues can be stressful and cause driving to be dangerous while talking about that situation a person may react differently which can cause an accident. The conversation they're can lower their driving ability if they get upset which can lead to you not focusing and losing control over the car. If people don't make a smart decision to not text and drive in their daily routine, they can put others at risk of losing their life.

Opponents claim that hands-free set is safer than using your phone because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and also suggesting that the behavior is safe. Research shows that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a cell phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists say that people talking over the phone to another person doesn't interfere with driving. The issues come is when a car suddenly Vere's of the road or into pedestrian traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So, the problem isn't focusing on the road and using the cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of a lack of smarts, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call-in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it in the accident how can they reach or find it if they are flipped over in their car. People shouldn't fully depend on their phones they are not reliable; you might not have it all the time a good solution for the situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they aren't as reliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and other people lives.
