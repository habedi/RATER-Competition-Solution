Many students must miss school for a multitude of reasons. Whether it's for a medical reason or personal reason, they are missing out on valuable material being taught by their teachers. Missing even one day of this material makes it extremely difficult to catch up to the other students in the missed classes. This causes large amounts of stress in the students and oftentimes leads to even more missed school days. Being able to attend classes from home strongly benefits any absent student.

Online classes largely decrease the stress brought on students who miss school. Medical inhibitors prevent a large number of students from attending class. Students who play sports may become injured, making it more difficult to get to their classes. Students could also fall victim to an illness, preventing them from attending school. Today, with COVID-19, many students are reluctant to come to school, fearing that they will become sick and get their family members sick as well. By attending classes online until they are able to return to school, students are able to heal and maintain their health and safety, while also continuing to learn the important subjects taught at school and not falling behind their peers.

Taking classes online can also benefit those who learn at a different pace than others. Students often either become overwhelmed with the fast pace of their teachers and peers, or they become bored and uninterested in their classes due to the slow speed of those around them. Online classes reduce the chance of these possibilities taking place by allowing students to learn at whatever pace works best for them. With the competitive environment of modern public schools, it can be difficult for struggling students to speak out and get help or ask their teachers to teach slower, but taking classes online allows them to figure out what speed they work best at.

Some may argue that students being able to attend classes from home does more harm than good due to the ability of students at school to work with others and socialize with their peers, but with the technology available today, students who take classes from home are still able to efficiently communicate and work with other students. Taking away the opportunity for absent students to catch up on missed work from home leads to an endless cycle of trying to make up late work and staying home to finish said late work. This cycle is deteriorating to students' mental health and education.

Being able to take online classes is a privilegeÂ brought by the extensive amount of technology available today. Many students are unable to attend classes for various reasons and struggle to teach themselves the material they missed. Online classes provide many benefits to students who miss school, such as reducing stress and allowing students to work at their own pace.
