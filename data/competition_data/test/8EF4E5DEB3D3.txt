Dear, TEACHER_NAME

This is a serious cause to many people but for some reason many of those students have a grade C average but you must have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. In this reasonable letter I will be supporting my argument with specific reasons. Feel welcome to not accept my reasonings but i assure you that it will be better to let C students be eligible for playing sports.

My number top one reason is that the school will lose popularity do to the fact that students will transfer out to another school in search of a school that accept C students in sports and other activities. The school will lose money but not that much but yeah they will have no more basketball games or any other sport that requires an entrance fee. So I really think that you should consider the policy before you make it official. Another reason to let these students get in sports is that a C is a passing criteria grade point average score. Another reason is that it will help the students out of gang and drug participation, instead they would be in school training or participating in a school activity.

So please TEACHER_NAME help the school by accepting C students into sports. It would save you a lot of F students and trouble with the school. You will also be helping out a family in accepting his/or her child into a free sport team instead of struggling to pay a out side of school team which would cost alot of cheddar. I hope this essay has changed your mind, good day to you sir and thank you for taking time to read this.
