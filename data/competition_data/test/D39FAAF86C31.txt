DEAR PRINCIPLE

I think that we shouldn't have to have a B' average to participate in sports or other activities. I think that if they try that's all that matters in who nose that playing their favorite sports might make them an afleg in they maybe come famous in probably make this school famous in stuff like that shouldn't be fair at all. It just not right to abandon them from there favorite sports period that will probably make them seem like you don't care about them they need to make something out of them self.

In so please I COME

TO YOU I ask you as in independent young lady don't take are sports away just because we got a C'

yah i would think you'll be doing the right thing if they had a E' or lower grade average because C' are good grade to the good grades are A' B' C'

in the bad grades are D' E' F' so don't ABANDON

C' average STUDENT from what they want to do in life.

kids these they don't feel no love in that's why they probably teens now be in gangs cause they have a C' average in y'll won't let us do activities or let us do the sports we want to play in all I am trying to say when we come famous you gone regret that you ever doubted us CAUSE WERE TRUE AFLEGS TRUE IN INDEPENDENT I TILL YOU ...
