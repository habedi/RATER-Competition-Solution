Dear Principal,

I've been hearing that trying to change no sports unless you have a B or higher. Well I disagree because theirs people that try but when they try they don't do so good. I'm pretty sure that has happened to everyone. I know it happened to me before. If you do make that rule it would actually help some people so I don't disagree and I don't agree with that rule. Well I'm in sports and its really hard to keep your grades up when your in sports because theirs things that you might not get in class. Then if you ask the teacher some may get mad and start screaming at you. Some of my teachers do that but I don't care I will still ask the teacher for help. I don't really care if they get mad I need help I want help. When I'm in sports I have to go try hard if not I'll miss a game. I already missed one game and i was so mad that I missed one because it was a tournament. I'm just happy that I get to play today. so I'm really in a good mood today because I get to play. I still cant believe I had an F I was surprised that happened I was really disappointed. Well those are my reasons and opinions.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
