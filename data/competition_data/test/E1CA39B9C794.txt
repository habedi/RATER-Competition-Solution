The conditions of Venus and its atmosphere are unbareable. According to the passage the surface of Venus is 800 degrees Ferhenheit. The author states that human curiosity drives us to discover new things about this planet and find a way to make something that would help make the conditions barable.

According to the passage, NASA wants to use a hovering vehicle that would avoid the dangerous surface temperatures. The hover craft would not allow us to get samples of the ground, but only of the atmosphere. The text states that, if scientists want a thorough mission they would need to get up close and land on Venus. Scientists want to do this despite the risks.

Venus is a very fascinating planet full of mysteries we have yet to discover. In conclusion the author thinks that our travels should not be limited by challenges and dangers we face. We should not be limited by the doubts. We should not be limited by fears or the unknown. But that we should push the boundries, innovate, and use our imagination to take us anywhere.
