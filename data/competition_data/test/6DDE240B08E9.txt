Do you like doing extracurricular activates at school like sports, yearbook, and student council if not then this is a good place for you. I think this because the kids most of the time get to pick there activity, they can have fun in these activities and make new friends, and they can help you make friends you didn't know. There are a lot of activities you can do and just pick the best one in your opinion and have fun. I think that kids should do this because when school is out and after most kids just sit around and not work but with after school activities kids will use there brain more then if they are just sitting around.

In school most kids are not interested in school because they think it is boring but most after school programs will,l make it fun thats why kids go there . But in extracurricular activities you can choose what you want to do and you can have a good time. If you like sports then you could play a lot of sports. If you like board games then you can play board games. But if your not good in school then there might be consequences like not choosing your favorite activity. E

In after school activities you can make friends that have the same interest as you. If you choose it and someone else dose as well then you probably like the same thing. You came make friends that can last you a life time. It helps to know that the other person likes what you like so you can do it together and not come plane about it. Extracurricular activities will help make friends that have the same interests as you and thats one of the reasons i like them.

You can join a club that is fun and you can get some school help from it as well. It can help you pass a class if you need some extra help in it. It can also be really fun like sports then you probably think they are fun and sometimes you can learn something from that sport. You can do their things like Lego club, reading club, and ext. E

I think that having extracurricular clubs is good and i think that all schools should have it . It is good because most of the time kids get to choose their own club, they can make new friends, and they can be fun and they may help you out with school. I think that they will help kids because kids will be lying around in their house doing nothing after school but when they work it can get there brains going.
