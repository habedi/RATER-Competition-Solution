Dear principal,

I consider that community service is a great that you have came up with.

there fore there is many great reasons that community service is a very good for us. first of all it helps kids show responsibly for there selves, also its a great way of showing friendship among each other and there fore it a good thing for kids to be getting started if ever in there life they become some thing.

To begin with, community service shows your kids how to grow up and start being responsible among their acts as well as others. that's a way they will learn how too be in time in places they need to be. For example helping a kid in there home work after school that's showing the time they need to be there and also show them the things they have too do. But also responsibility is not a harm is a very good thing that can help you and other in becoming a better person in the future .

Second of all doing community service may not be a choice but look at the things it can get you to. Friend ship is another way of doing community service because while you doing community service you are also helping that person in things they need but was hard too do because of that person not volunteered in helping them. friend ship may be not the easiest thing for some one because of them suppose of being a nerd or something. also there you may find true friend ship because other friends are true in becoming your friend.

Lastly also doing community service can make you set a great leader among yourself. There fore you doing community service would stop you from doing bad things. For example say you afraid to tell your friend in saying no well just tell them i have too go my community service and help others maybe they would laugh but you will feel so good inside of not doing what they had wanted you to do.

To sum this up, rather for you doing something bad you can be doing a great deed for others in the world also there's ain't a lot of kids that are able of going too school but why not you be the one to help them out in that. You would be very proud of you and there fore i promise there parents would to.
