To The Principal:

I think that policy number one would be the best option for middle school and high school instead of elementary because first almost all of the elementary students don't have cell phones so in middle school its relatively the same thing but there is a lot more who have a cell phones. Plus most kids should be mature enough already to have the common sense to turn off their phones in class because that is what our principal does all of the students that have phones have to register it into our school before it can be brought to school and at know time can the cell phone be used and it must be off and concealed. Instead this policy is better in my opinion with the ability to use your cell phone at lunch it will help kids blow off steam and maybe focus better in the later classes provided the cell phone is turned off after lunch which again is common sense. So in my opinion make this new policy happen i like it and i can abide by its rules easily and it also makes me happy because then i can text or call my friends and family at lunch so i don't have to worry about family and i can check in with friends from other schools besides that a lot of kids in high school have their cell phones out in the halls texting and calling and stuff like that plus with this new policy is obviously going to be noisy in lunch and the halls so easily just make a rule to have all cell phones on vibrate if your going to be using them simple and easy i think its a great policy that should really be set in motion for at least all middle and high schools in Maryland and all states if those states allow.
