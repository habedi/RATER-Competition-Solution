Has your principle ever said you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Well my principle has, and I think students just want to chill sometimes. My mom needs me after school to help her with my baby brother. I am against this because you may want to spend time with family, you may have to do something after school, and the people your working with in the activity are not working or helping you.

To begin with, you may have to do something out side of school, like you and your house hold have to go out of town. Most of the time, kids leave there room messy in the morning when picking out their clothes so after school they have to clean their room. Or, you might have a appointment after school. And sometimes, students have to work after school or help their mom or dad with work.

Also, you may want to spend time with your family. A family member or friend could be very sick and that could be the last time you see them. Sometimes, your parents have split up and you are on a weekly play when you get to see your mother or father. Often, you may want to have a meet because your friend of family member has past away.

Finally, the people your working with are not doing their part. Most of the time, I get put in a activity group with students that are lazy and get off task easily by others. Often, you or the students your working with may not get along, or maybe had issues in the past. Sometimes, I have students in my activity group that play around too much. Or, they may not be good at what the activity is and not do any work.

In conclusion, the reason I am against this because you may want to spend time with your family and friends, most people have to do something after school, and the people in your group may not be helpful.
