Dear Principal,

In may cases, community service should be required but in some cases such as this one it would be cogent if you do not enforce community service upon students. Initially,

Placing community service on students would shorten the time they spend with their family and friends. spending time with community service well not provide students time to talk, eat, and study with friends and family. Furthermore, Community service will not allow students time to play sports and do other fun activities during and after school. during the school year students like to spend their time with fun activities instead of picking up trash and stuff like that its already hard enough to have fun while teachers are assigning home work twenty-four seven so the students plead not to make them spend more time doing stuff they do not like to do. Moreover, Letting kids show responsibility on their own will carry them further in life Then just making them do something. Making students do responsible things will just encourage them to do a half-fast job which will be a lost for everyone especially they students who really want to help out it will make their job twice as hard. Ultimately, enforcing community servers will be a bad thing to do even for the meritorious students who do community service for fun.

From,

The Students
