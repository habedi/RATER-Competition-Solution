from "the challenge of exploring venus" the author belives thier are great benifits of venus. In paragraph 2 it says "often referred to as earths twin, venus os the closest plant to earth in terms of denstiy and size, and occasionally the closest in distances too.". venus its almost alike to earth. The aurthor belives it to be. Yes venus is are "sister planet" but what about the dangers of going to venus?

Venus has a thick atmosphere of alomst 97% carbon dioxide, even in paragraph 3 it says "Even more challening are the clouds of highly corrocsive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere". How are we to visit venus when we cant even breath on the surface. the conditions are far more alarming then any human incounter.

Yet again still think we should go to venus but why? In paragraph 4 is says "astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth_-like plant in our solar system."

Even withe the dangers of venus one day we will find a way to land on venus. Venus maybe are new home.
