Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

The schools are hopeful that students will retain information they have previously learned and review the concepts of the new material for the upcoming courses they will enter the next school year.

These projects have the option to be designed by the students or their teachers.

Teachers can assign a project to each student based on the course work in their classes, or students can choose a project to complete on a topic of their choice.

Projects which are required to be completed over summer break should solely be student-designed for the overall success of the students.

Student-designed projects completed during summer break will greatly help the student succeed and benefit more than teacher-designed projects.

Students who design their own projects will choose a topic that they are passionate and eager to learn more about.

When students are engaged in a topic, they will have a desire to excel, leading them towards success in the completion and quality of their projects.

When my cousin Generic_Name was in tenth grade, he had to complete a project for his science class.

Generic_Name hopes to become a meteorologist after he graduates college, and he loves to study the atmosphere and weather.

For his project, his teacher asked him to study common genetic disorders.

Generic_Name despised learning about genetics and waited to complete his project the day before it was due.

Generic_Name did not receive a good grade on his project and had to work extra hard the remainder of the year to pass his science class.

Generic_Name experience shows how student-designed projects benefit the student.

If he had been allowed to choose his own topic for his project, he would have been glad to complete a project so that he could learn more about the atmosphere and weather, a topic he finds appealing.

Therefore, student-designed projects are more beneficial because they provide ample learning for the students.

Unfortunately, opponents argue that teacher-designed projects will allow the students to fully learn the information that they need to know.

They insist that teachers know what information will be in their students classes and that students should adhere to the information within those courses.

Some even argue that teachers should assign projects to students based on the areas each student needs extra practice mastering.

However, student-designed projects have many benefits which greatly outweigh these concerns.

Opponents are worried that students will only do the bare minimum if they design their own projects.

This is definitely not the case, as proven by Generic_Name science project.

Students will not be willing to work hard or take enough time to properly complete a teacher-designed project that does not interest them when they are on their summer breaks.

Students will be eager to fully complete a project if they can choose their own topic.

Therefore, teacher-designed projects are not the best way for a student to learn.

In conclusion, student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed projects.

They provide the student to learn much more than they would if they had been assigned a specific project.

Student-designed projects allow the students show their passion and eagerness about a certain topic.

Teacher-designed projects are not beneficial to the student despite what opponents may argue.

They force the student to study a topic that the student does not have an interest in, causing the student to do poorly on the assignment.

Generic_Name teacher-designed project shows how students do not learn from being assigned a project but from being able to choose and discover one on their own.

Student-designed projects are obviously best way to continue learning during summer break.
