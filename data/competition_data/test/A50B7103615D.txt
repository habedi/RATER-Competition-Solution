In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars however, the positive aspects outweight the negative aspects. Developing these cars can be an enormous help to everyone. They can notify the driver when the road needs human skills, sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer, and have the driver's seats vibrate when the car is in danger of backing up into an object. Being able to have these driverless cars will help to have more safe driving,

Having sensors and computer hardware and software helps drivers be notified of when they are needed to navigate "through work zones and around accidents." The driver's seat being able to vibrate to alert the driver of when they might back up into an object helps prevent accidents or crashes. These cars can also "steer, accelerate, and brake themselves," but still are designed to tell the driver when they are needed to do tasks only the drivers can do. The information coming from the sensors can cause the car to apply "brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control," than a driver can manage alone. Having cars be able to do such things like that help us in everyway they can.

Being able to develop these driverless cars will make everything much safer well, in driving. These cars can do anything a driver can do but still need a driver. Yes, you may ask if they are driverless cars then why do they still need a driver? Well, the answer is simple we need them because they still need to be able to work around crashes and navigating through work zones. "While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver," with this being said the car helps the driver as much as the driver helps the car.
