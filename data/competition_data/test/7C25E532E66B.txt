No!!! I certainly do not agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from offering distance learning or video conferencing because, Kids now a days they think school doesn't help them in any way through life that's debatable, kids now believe that school doesn't help them in any way because they think that all you do in school is swallow unimportant information and spit it out on test/quizzes that may be true. So if schools offer distance learning as an option for students to take a class then there's really not a lot the students will do rather then complain even more about about school. Now what the students need is motivation they need some sorts of motivation to wake them up early in the morning and be proud to go to school. Because thats what makes everyone stronger is Motivation. I believe that if we find that motivation for the many students then they will go to school everyday and strive for more and more and not only will this help with their life skills but it will make them really find there passion and do what they love doing. Some kids that are lazy in school but they are athletic get that motivation from school sports because thats what they love and they are willing to bring there grades up and go to school everyday because of that motivation and love that they have.

Instead of offering distance learning as an option for students how about we create more classes that have more life skills rather then useless information we need. One idea that I had planned was a class based on social media and how to use it wisely and how to potentially earn money from posting pictures and all that sort of business in my opinion that would be an excellent way for kids to come to school and learn about all the life skills there is, this will make them more mature and more open minded to seeing big things there is in life and I guarantee that this will make them come to school every single day and learn something new as the day goes and who knows what if that student in that class becomes really successful. My main point is to give a lot of students really good opportunities and what they want to achieve in life no matter how hard things can be.

Now I can see how you can debate on schools having distance learning for students to attend school can help. For example if your ever sick or you play a certain sport and you really love that sport with all your love and god forbid you happen to break your leg, things like that occur mysteriously you never know any thing can happen and I can see how distance learning can help. Or online classes would be a good way these are all really good way for students to attend class. But the bad things about it is that it will make you even more lazy as time goes by you just want to stay home and do online classes and not care that much.

Another idea I personally had in mind is having a class on how to work on stocks and money. A lot of kids love to have money and they know how to blow it off less then a day and this class that personally recommend will really help them think on how they will invest and also save there money. Again this is another life skill that kids need to learn in order to be successful in life. So for this idea that is mentioned by me this is a great way for students to come attend school from home.

Overall i disagree with schools offering students distance learning as an option for students to attend class because students don't see why school can help them in any life situation.
