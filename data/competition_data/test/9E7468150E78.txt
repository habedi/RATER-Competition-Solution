Dear Principal,

Basketball practice had just ended for RELATIVE_NAME. He was waiting outside for his mom to pick him up. Minutes had passed and minutes had turned into hours that RELATIVE_NAME had been waiting outside for his mom to pick him up. Eventually, RELATIVE_NAME had to walk home due to his principal's idea of a new cell phone policy. Is Policy 2 really benefiting us as students? Of course not, students should be allowed to bring their cell phone to school.

Students will still have a form of communication. Students will be able to communicate with parents in case of an emergency. Studies have shown that 92% of students use their cell phones to communicate with their parents in case of an emergency. When a student brings their cell phones to school, it allows them to consistently send update to their parent(s) or guardian.

A students survey has shown that students use their cell phones on a daily basis to let others , such as their parents or siblings, to inform them about surprise events at school. Students will feel more at ease with their cell phones. Ask any student why they should be allowed to have a cell phone at school. They will tell you because they feel more comfortable knowing that they have someone to call on with the push of a button.

Parents can benefit from the first policy as well. Not only will students feel more comfortable, parents will too! It makes them feel better to hear from their child that they are okay and that they are in a safe environment. Parents can pick up their child from school from after school events without the student having to wait for a long length of time.

Teachers will also benefit from policy 1 because they won't have to wait for a parent to come pick up their child after school. Teachers have lives outside of the school and waiting for a parent to come pick up their child is not part of it. So, really think about it. Policy 1 is the better choice, wouldn't you agree?

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
