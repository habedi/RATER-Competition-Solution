The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" suggests studying Venus is a hopeful endevor despite the danger it presents, its both terrifying and wonderous how Venus mirrors what Earth would have looked like if it was closer to the sun. Venus is the most unexplored planet in the solar system, less than the Earth's oceans.

Venus could give us reason to develop new technology to last longer on its surface: "Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks." We human beings tested silicon carbide electronics in a chamber simulating Venus's surface and it lasted three weeks before it was finally broken down by the chaotic conditions.

Venus is a worthy pursuit, a dangerous one, but worthy. If we do not try, then we might as well give up everything we accomplished to an incinerater and just sit on the couch doing nothing and wasting precious time.
