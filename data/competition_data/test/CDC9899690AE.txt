It is the beginning of the new school year, and your in class the principal makes an anccoument you have to join a extracurricular activity. I agree with what the principal says because. You can make new friends and bonds, explore something new, and have a happier life.

Make new friends everyone says it is easy. For me it is not to hard but for others it is a challenge. That is why doing an activity after school is really helpful for people to make friends. All the friends I have are from after school activities. For example I had a sleepover with kids on my lacrosse team a day ago. I would have never known them unless I tried something new after school. That is why you should find something that you enjoy because kids in there will share a common interest in that club. Then you can get to know each other and bond over that common interest. Like my lacrosse story I was more of a football guy until I was convinced to play. Now I have great friendships and great support, and I am enjoying every minute of it. If you think you can't make friends or it is to hard or you want to be alone. Just try a club, sport, and other great choices trust me it will work out. No one deserves to be alone now you go get yourself a friend and do a extracurricular activity.

Exploring new things now that is hard. Exploring new things can be nerve racking and make you anxious. Exploring something new is great and it will help you keep an open mind. Doing anything new is pretty bad at first you feel sick you just want to keep doing what your doing. You just want to stay in your comfort zone stick with what your doing, but sometimes you need to escape it and explore. Exploring new things is a little bit unsettling. Just like an extracurricular try something new and you might just become your favorite thing. Seeing and doing things that are new to you is amazing. It might spark interest, it can help you make friends, and teach you to try do more new things. If you try something new to you and you like it that activity or hobby can turn into a chain reaction. Of you trying things new and who wants to live a life of the same thing you can live a little find something new. Just go in headfirst what is life without a little risk without risk your life is the definition of boredom. If you ever think about doing something new or it sparks interest go for it.

A happy life lots of people have their own definition of a happy life. Well how does being with a group of people or a team that share something in common, and no one is left out sound. Extracurricular activity like a football team if you are on it the other players share a passion for the game. That is happiness like a second family that is my lacrosse team we have created that bond. You can to if you chose something new and your are passionate about it. You will find those people and being with those people pretty much everyday. Creating that special bond will make your life 10000 times better you will have that sense of belonging somewhere. Where you are comfortable around people and you can be yourself around that second family. You can take off that mask off ,and stop being someone you pretend to be and rip it off and be yourself. You join a group maybe the first won't work but I promise you will find that sense of belonging somewhere else besides home. You will have that sense of happiness true happiness once you reach that there is no anything much better that that I promise.

Just maybe you still don't like this idea of extracurricular activities and you just want to stay by yourself and fly under the radar. that is fine it is your choice but if you kept and open mind and tried it. You will make new friends and new bonds, explore and do something new, and live a true happy life. If you are going to high school or you are in high school and you do not do anything after school. Just try it find something you like and do it if it does not work out then you can go back to your confront zone. Life needs a little risk and that risk is you joining an after school extracurricular activity.
