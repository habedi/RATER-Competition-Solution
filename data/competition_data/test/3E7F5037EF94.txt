Some people think that attending class from home is a bad thing because they think they wouldn't learn better that way

I think that some schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing because that may make it better for some students to learn and some students may feel distracted at school and can't learn there because some students dont come to class to learn they come there to just distract others and bully others. Also thats another reason why students doesn't want to come to school because of bullying, and some people think its okay to bully others when they actually wanna get something done in school to learn something. People say that might be a bad thing to attend classes by a way of online or video classes, but i personally disagree with that because as long as somebody is guarding you at the moment for a example if you have your parent right there watching you while you are attending classes by video conferences or online classes that would be much help because your mom can actually see what your doing and see which one is more better and comfortable for you. Online classes can help people with so much now days because thats where kids now go in today society is online to look up answers and information they haven't been taught in school and online always make us understand it more than being in a class with full of kids who dont wanna learn and learn something new for once.

I personally know this is better because my sister took a online class before because she wasn't learning well in school because she was getting distracted by a lot of students and was making bad grades but she was very smart, So my mom decided to make her to online classes instead of going to school because she feel like she can learn better that way and it is a more easy environment for her to get er work done and learn in better. That actually helped her get better because she started to make good grades catch up and actually graduate on time because she was on the roll to not graduating on time and she was gonna fail if she didn't pass her Sols she had to take at the end of the year. Also Homeschooling can be a bit different from just taking online classes and video conferencing classes because some students for some reason doesn't like to do work in front of teachers and they somehow get there work better in peace.

I feel that is true because a lot of students i asked do they like to work in peace or in a area where somebody is around you and talking and they all told me peace and i also agree with that because it helps us work better and understand it more better. One day i was with my friends in a class and we were all in a group doing a assignment and we were all just talking laughing and playing and not getting nothing done and we had to be finish with it before the end of the class and we barely got anything done, So the teacher separated us and told me to work alone. So once i started to work alone i started to realize that helped me better because is started to get my work done and catch up, and i wasnt distracted by my friends nun of that time. A word of advice from me is if you know that your distracted by your friends but you don't to say nothing because your scared of what they gonna say about just ask the teacher can you work by yourself because at the end of the day your going to be one that passes while they fail and if you do fail with them your gonna regret everything at the end and wish you never did it.

People may think oh your so boring because you wanna take online classes and not come to school, But no thats not the case because school is not always about coming there to chat with friends all day. I mean yea its fun to go to school to talk with friends and have fun but sometimes that has to come to a stop because your education always come first before fun and my mom and grandma always taught me that when i was little and i never used to listen to it until i got in a situation that involved me so close to failing ad i started to realize its not a joke and the friends that your laughing with will not care 3 times about you failing and wouldn't not even try to lift you up when your close to failing. Being cool and bullying people is not school and thats why half of these students are dropping because either they're are not learning anything, getting bullied, something is going on at home, or they just don't wanna be there so mostly of time just come to school just to make other students not wanna be there and encourage them to drop out with them or even make them think school is pointless and they dont have to learn anything to accomplish something in this world.

I feel like us people should try to force the government to start video confrencing class as another way to teach because nobody is not gonna do anything unless we make it known and let the government and everybody in the world what is going on in today society. I also think we all should sign a petition to start it all across the united states and see the difference from people learning better in school or at home while video conferencing with a teacher. There are alot of stories online where little kids are killing theirselves because people are constantly picking with them and they think they are coming to school to learn and they are suppose to be safe by the teachers, principals, and administrators at the school, But sometimes the teachers doesn't care or listen to the students unless its convient for them and unless the parent actually has to go to the school just to stop the situation. Students shouldn't be feeling scared to go somewhere where they think they are safe and protected but they are really there just to get hurt and people never know what they are going through at home.

Stay away from people who is not uplifting you but they're just putting you down,And try to get some type of online class to help you if you think your struggling.
