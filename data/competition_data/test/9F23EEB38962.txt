In my opinion, I believe driverless cars would have a great impact on this and next generation. Everday you that someone has died or critically injured themselves driving cars. Driverless takes all of future injuries away. Self-driving cars are safer because it has more sensors related to what the passage stated in paragraph 5.

You won't necessarily be driving but assisting the car even though the car drives on its own. That doesn't mean you may text on your phone even though your not driving, you will still need to pay attention and alerted just in case. Like, if there is a car accident, work zone, or if you are putting the vehicle into reverse, that would require human driving skills like the passage stated in paragraph 7. Car seats will vibrate if there a object behind the while reversing the car.

All in all, I believe driveless cars is a outstanding idea to infer. Its a problem solved before it occured. By 2020, like the text states" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves." Its easier and safer. The future is all about making everyday burdens easier and safer.
