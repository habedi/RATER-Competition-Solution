Schools everywhere are beginning to offer programs which allow students to participate in classes from the comfort of their own home. This new form of class has been made possible due to students being able to communicate with the teacher via video conferences or online. I believe that the integration of these types of classes would greatly benefits students in many ways. Students would be able to work at their own pace to understand the material better, they would be able to take more classes than previously allowed due to the time constraints of the school day, and students that may have difficulty going to school due to any circumstances would still able to learn the material from classes.

Firstly, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it would allow them to work at their own pace to fully understand the material. In traditional class rooms their is a lot of competition during the learning process which cause a lot of students to not be able to keep up with the pace. With virtual classes students would not experience this overwhelming feeling of being behind in class. They would be able to take their time to make sure that they fully master the material causing them to, in the end, learn more. Also, distance learning would make it so students could work at their own pace by allowing them to be able to take breaks if needed. All students learn differently and some students may need to take periodic breaks to be able to focus and retain information. This does not happen in regular classes and so many students feel overwhelmed with the pace; however, remote classes would allow these students to get the breaks they need. It is very important that students are allowed to have the learning style they need to be successful.

Secondly, virtual classes would allow students who may want to take more classes to be able to still take them, even if they don't have enough space on their school day schedule. Many students want to take extra classes besides the mandatory ones in order to learn things they enjoy. Distance learning would help enable these students dreams. They would be able to complete their required classes at home and be able to take classes that express their interests during the school day. Some students want to take extra classes to furthther their acedemic journey. These students are striving to build an outstanding transcript that would make them very attractive to colleges. Virtual classes would allow them to do this and could be the difference between them getting accepted or denied to their dream college.

Finally, distance learning would enable students who may have difficulty getting to school to still be able to learn. Sometimes, students are prohibited from going to school due to events like excessive snow, heat waves, outstanding air pollution, diseases, or others unforeseen events. Usually students just dont learn the material they need to during the time that the school is canceled, but distance learning would allow them to still gain the knowledge. It would also help them to not fall behind on any work and feel stressed when they need to catch up. Students can also be injured making it uncomfortable to attend school. When this happens, students are usually sent a bunch of worksheets that were done in class without much guidance from the teacher. A video conference or online communication between the student and teacher would help the student feel as thought they were not missing out on anything and would allow them to get any questions they had about the assignments answered. Virtual classes are a great way for students to stay connected to the teacher if they can't attend school.

In conclusion, the implementation of distance learning, or virtual classes that allow students to participate in classes from home, would be extremely beneficial for a student. They would be able to understand and retain material more efficiently by working at their own pace, they would gain the opportunity to take extra classes that they wouldn't otherwise have had time to take, and they would still be able to learn even if they can't go to school. Overall, I believe that distance learning, or virtual classes, is a great option for students.
