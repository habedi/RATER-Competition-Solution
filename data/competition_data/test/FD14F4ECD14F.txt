Dear principle,

I feel like policy one is the better policy. We should have the choice to bring our cell phones to school. you never know when it will be an emergency and you to your parents or someone. i know some kids may use their phone durning classes but most do not and we all do pay attention. i feel like we should be able to use our phones durning lunch and free periods. in those specific times we do not have a teacher talking to us and we have nothing to learn then. so if we are using our phones in those specific times it would not be hurting any one. there comes times when you need to text your mom or dad telling them something. for example i was on the school basketball team at my school and my parents would want to know if we were first or second game if they had to rush to leave work. or if you all of a sudden need to stay after for a project or to finish a test. another example is if you forgot your lunch, homework, project, ect you would be able to text your parent and see if they could bring it in for you so you would have it for that class if it was necessary for you to have brought it in that day.

I feel like the second policy for if you can have a cell phone in school is not the best idea. it is saying that we wouldn't be able to bring our phones to school. that we would have to leave it at home. the principle wouldn't be thinking of us. i know we don't NEED our phones in classes, but at lunch time and free periods i don't understand why we wouldn't be able to use it because then we are not distracting our learning because at that point we are all with our friends and they don't care if we are using it. i do understand about the part that our phones need to be on silent durning classes because if they went off that would be a distraction durning that class time but other than that we should be able to have our phones with us at ALL times no matter what the situation is. our phones would be in our pocket on silent durning learning times but every once in a while in our hands using it durning lunch time or a free period. the time that we have our phone doesn't over power our time for learning. we will have our phone with us for maybe one hour, but we would be without our phones for five hours. we should be able to bring our phones with us when we go to school, they are in use for emergency's, that's when we NEED our phones in school!

Sincerely, the students of the school
