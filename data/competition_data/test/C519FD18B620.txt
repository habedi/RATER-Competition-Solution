Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should allow students to use cell phones during lunch for a few reasons. One reason is that kids always bring their phones to school and use them in class because they feel cool and if you allowed some usage of their phones I think the amount of kids using their phones in class would go down.

Also in lunch we are not allowed to get up and move tables, which causes some kids to not see or talk to some of their other friends, but if you allowed cell phone usage then kids could talk to all their friends and everyone would be happy. My greatest and final reason is that some kids could text their parents or relatives and ask if they could bring something up that they may have forgotten at home before their next class.

If you allowed some cell phone usage I believe kids would listen better in class and kids would enjoy school more. Being able to talk to all your friends is a good thing because they can tell you what your doing in a class that they might of had before you. Also if you are having a bad day your friends can help you get through it and if you cant talk to them they can't help you. Being able to text my mom and ask her to bring up something before my last classes would be nice, I have forgotten things before and since 8th grade has a no late work policy i got zeros on the work.
