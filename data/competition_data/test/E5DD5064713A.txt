What purpose does doing online classes and video conferencing hold rather than attending an actually school building? This could be harmful to a students learning and social interactions in life.

Students should not have the option to do distance learning and take classes online or via video conferencing because if the student needs help they won't be able to call a teacher over to help them, students are less likely to do work on time, and students will not get the social interaction with other students that they would by going to school.

When a student attends school they have many resources to help them when they need help. If a student is doing school threw video conferencing or online they wont get that one on one help that they would in person. Teachers are there to help students when they need it but it becomes harder when they cant actually talk to the student . When taking online classes, you are basically teaching yourself a subject and relying on the information given to you to succeed. Learning becomes increasingly more difficult when its not in person. If the student doesn't understand the concept and can't learn it than they could possibly fail that topic.

Students who decide that taking classes at home don't always have a schedule. Some online courses only give you a due date and let you work at your own pace, while others have a structured plan where you have to spend a certain amount of time per day working on that class. Students wouldnt have to get out of bed or get ready for school making them more likely to sleep in and not do work when needed.

By attending school student get social interactions that they would not get if they stayed home. By staying home for school, students are limiting the amount of time they spend with others. In a school building there is a diverse population of kids and students get exposed to other cultures and friendships that they wouldn't experience through online. Students become more likely to have less friends and lack social interaction skills when not put into a social environment with others.

On the other hand, Students who do online courses and video conferencing for school are able to work at their own pace. They have the ability to spend more or less time on a topic that they are learning. This provides a student time to understand and learn concepts the best way possible for them rather than being forced to learn a single way that they don't understand. As long as the student does their work and completes it on time there wouldn't be any issues with passing the class.

Students should attend school at an actual school building. Online classes and video conferencing serve no greater purpose rather than to not have students all in the same building. Students should not have the option to do distance learning and take classes online or via video conferencing because if the student needs help they won't be able to call a teacher over to help them, students are less likely to do work on time, and students will not get the social interaction with other students that they would by going to school.
