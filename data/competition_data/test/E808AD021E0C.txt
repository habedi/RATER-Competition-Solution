My view on changing school policies is that it may not be such a good suggestion. Maybe the principle should think that twice before actually changing it into a school policy. This may affect a lot of students because they may want to be a professional athlete when they grow up to be someone in life.

I have many friends that are involved in sports and have bad grades but i know that if they really put there minds to it they can get an average B or higher. My belief is that a lot of kids get lazy and don't do the work. I think that if the principle would just let them know she's thinking about this policy a lot of kids in these sports activities would get to work and try way harder in school.

So I am against this policy because this could affect many kids or young adults in their future career. Some teachers may not think so but just go head and ask the coaches or the teachers who organize these activities. Ask them and just here to what they'll tell you. They may tell you that they know that a lot of there students are capable of getting a B or higher. I hope This really changes the principles mind. I hope this really makes her think twice about this new policy.
