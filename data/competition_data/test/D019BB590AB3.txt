Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling with the new system called Facial Action Coding System. I am all for this system. The (FACS) is break threw technology if you dont understand something they are going to make it so you do. Tis technology could be a big breakthrew on smartphones and other devices.

In the text it proves that the (FACS) technology works but how. This amazing technology works by using a video imagery softwere that calculates all 44 muscles in the human face. and who better to understand the human face better than Leonardo Da Vinci. (states in paragraph 5)Da Vinci studied anatomy in the face to help him draw more realistic pictures of the face but Dr. Huang belives Da Vinci was trying to put a smile on your faces.

Dr. Huang belives Da Vinci was trying to put a smile on your face. the Mona Lisa was painted with very little emotion witch is what made it so hard to figure out if she was sad or disapointed. Now that we have the breakthrew technology you can put a smile on your face.

All in all I think this technology is great. We can tell how people are feeling and make there days better. Work enviroments are going to be so much better to work in when all your peers and co-workers are happy. I am for this technology because we all need more happiness. You can never have to much and never to little.
