To the principal,

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME, and I am writing this letter to inform you that I agree with your policy change. You said that students need at least a "B" average to participate in sports or other activities. That is a good idea and I would like for you to know.

Firstly, requiring students to have at least a "B" average is a excellent idea. Doing this forces students to work harder and achieve goals at a higher standard. Working harder as a student at your school will make me come to school prepared, and to follow the instructions that the teacher gives me. I like my school and doing this will make me like it even more. This tells me that if you want to go to college, if have to get good grades and be determine to work.

Secondly, I play for one of the sports teams at your school and my grades have improved a lot. Once I got the message I had to work harder to continue playing basketball. I love playing basketball, and I'm not going to let my grades make me stop playing basketball. If you look at some of the top players in the NBA

like Rajon Rondo, he worked hard and got good grades. He was good in algebra and he didn't let that stop him from going to the NBA.

I can be just like him or even better than him, I all need to do is try and work hard. When you work hard and get good grades in life you will get good results out of it. This is very important to me.

Overall, I like the decision you made as my school principal. Your decision has made kids realized that getting good grades are important and this is going to be an important factor later in our lives. I had an average grade of a "C", now I have an average grade of an "A" minus. Once my family and coach heard the news, they were proud of my accomplishments and efforts to getting good grades. I am so happy that you are my principal, and I know you are going to continue to make good decisions like this.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
