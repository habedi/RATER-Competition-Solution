The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers it presents, because no spacecraft has survied landing for more than a few hpurs sice it too hot for the spacraft. Venus is not really close to the sun ans still have extreme heat but its closer to the Earth which often referred to as the Earth's "twin." It's more challenging because in Paragraph 3 its says," On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." the conditions are too extreme for a human for a human to set foot on Venus.

NASA is sending humans to study Venus to figure out what kinds of material they need to send a spacecraft to Venus and explore it. In Paragraph 5 its says, "NASA's possible soultion to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide which is not good for human, so they would need much more material for the human to survive with all that carbon dioxide. Scientists are seeking to condut a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk (Paragraph 6).

NASA is working on studying more about Venus, but it's still risky for humans and spacecraft. NASA is now testing simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested on Venus's surface and has lasted about 3 weeks in such condition. In such heat the material should be liquefy because of extreme heat. It won't be easy but NASA is trying to make it survivalbe for humans.

The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is that, NASA trying their hardest to explore Venus and needs material to study about it. NASA is using many matrial to have a spacecraft land on Venus and stays for a long time and not melt.
