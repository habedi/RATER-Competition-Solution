Dear principal,

I am writing you this letter because we students try our best to get at least a C average.

Work isn't easy as is seems. Many students try so hard to pass, but everyone has a different mind. Not everyone has the same, want to join these fun activities without stressing. Can't you see some students are improving there D average into c average. We all have rough times in our life. There's students that lose a really close family and we go to school but we can't forget about it. Other students have parents losing their jobs or homes and they don't know what to do about it.

Some students have trouble learning or some have trouble staying on task. There's some students who are begin picked on or begin bulled around. My point is that we all have problems in our life and we just don't have time to put it aside and work. It takes time for that. Were all just students and yet we try so hard. Students should know this

"Fall down 7 times

Get back up 8 times"

We all fail sometimes but that's ok. We just get back on our feet and try again. Life isn't easy and we all know that, but where all just human. At least a C average can let us do what we want, that we love, that we can have something fun to do, to forget all the trouble we have in life.

So hope my letter to you will help you understand the rough times we have in life. I think that students should have at least a C average or higher to join activities or participate in sports.

Sincerely Yours,

STUDENT_NAME
