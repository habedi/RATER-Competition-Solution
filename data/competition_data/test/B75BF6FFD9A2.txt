Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I clearly agree with you. I do think that in order to participate in sports or other activities the students should have a C grade average because, I think that students should not let anything come across them and learning. Also because this lets us know that we are falling behind in our school work and its also warning us that we are either failing or barley passing.

Students should focus more on their future than on anything else. If they want to live in the streets its fine, but they warned them. They should be more aware of their knowledge and grades than anything. The sport and competitions, it doesn't matter if you loose or win, its just a game to begin with.

On the other hand, students should have the right to play whatever sport they like, but it's their grade and future, not ours. It's better to let them handle their stuff, and then maybe they'll know that something is wrong. Students should learn how to handle things and do things right. It will be affecting their grade, not anybody else's.

So I state my point, students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade C average. This helps students know that what they are doing is wrong and that they are caring too much about the sport or activity that they do.
