The Seagoing Cowboys is a program that you should join if you like farm animals and know how to take care of horses, mules, and young cows. I think this is a program that you and other people should really join. Why? Well keep reading to find out.

This oraganzation is just for you because it offers the right things to help you get to other people in need. In the text it says, "To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together." What a neat way to serve for others! I would really like to have the joy of doing that.

The Seagoing Cowboys also supply you with the chance to see the world. It states that, " 'Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.' " Luke also got to see and tour other places he had never seen before. Some where Greece, Italy and the Panama Canal.

The Cowboys offer one other great thing that is the most important thing for every one to have, fun. They also have great games for exersize. When they were done with the shipping and going back home for more stuff it says in the story that, "The cowboys played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed." Doesn't that sound like fun? They also did other activities like whittling and reading in their spare time.
