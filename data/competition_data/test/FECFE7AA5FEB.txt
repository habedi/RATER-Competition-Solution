World War ll was and horrible war because it happened all over the world. My name is Luke and I was a Seagoing Cowboy that help the ones that were affected by World War II. I think that you should be one too.

The Seagoing Cowboys are real amazing people that help other in need of help. The Seagoing Cowboys get to go to place that are far out like China and Italy. Also while you are in these amazing places you can sight see. That isn't the only thing you will be remembered by those people in those different places. You will be remembered as a hero to them because you helped them while they were in need.

Now I'm gonna tell you about my experience as a Seagoing Cowboy. The traveling was amazing because I got to go to different place and help people and see their homes. Then as I went to these different place I got to see the different building and sculptures that have probably been there for decades. So the thing that I did you can probably do as well or maybe even more.

As I said in the began World War II was a horrible war for everyone and some people's homes were destroyed and they have nothing to go to at night. So this why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy so that you can help people and be a hero in their eyes.
