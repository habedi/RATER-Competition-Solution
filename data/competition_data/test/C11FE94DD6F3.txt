I believe that the "do not allow students to have phones at school at all" policy is better. Many of the student often text with their friends or listen to music because they think that class is boring. This also impacts their grades by not focusing. Also, it distracts other students and their ability to work. Other students go and meet friends by texting and to talk. It also makes other students to do the same thing and that makes them get in trouble, especially the one who is smart and gets work done. Also it can lead problems to the principal because some of the students who's phone has been taking away might argue with the principal with their parents and that can cause problems to the principal and to the school. Also, when students text, they might be missing some important information's that contains strategies and that can help them pass a test or quizzes.
