The Face on Mars is definitely not an alien artifact. It is just a natural landform that was formed on Mars. Don't you think we would have discovered this earlier if it was an alien artifact.

When we first photographed the Face is 1976 we said it looked like a face, but when we released the pictures a few days later the caption noted a "huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This means that other people here at NASA had doubts about it being an actual human head.

When we went to photograph it a second time in 1998 we got a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. After waiting for the image to appear on the internet we stated that it was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all.

Then we went back to photograph the Face a third time to prove that it was just a natural landform on April 8, 2001. It was a cloudless summer day which means that the images would be clear. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's best quality. Jim Garvin later added to the subject of the Face being a natural landform by saying "It remimds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake Piver Plain in Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isloated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." This means that Jim Garvin believes that it may just be a lava dome that is on Mars and not a face.

Now some people might say we don't want anybody knowing there is life on Mars. Conspiracy theorists say " The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide." But why would we want to hide life on Mars. It wouldn't hurt our business if anything it would make our business even better so why would we want to keep it a secret if it really was a face.

There is just to much evidence as to why this lanform isn't a face. I'm sure many of people would agree with me on this topic. Maybe one day we will discover life on Mars, but for now it is just a natural landform.
