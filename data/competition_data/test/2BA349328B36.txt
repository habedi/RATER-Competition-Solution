Mars is a very big place. scientict are trying to figure out how or if people would be able to live there. in this picture there is a thing face of some sort.

people beleave that it happen to be created by aliens. it appears to be that even if it was aliens wouldnt they have to prove if there was such things as aliens. this bump couldve been created by a coment, rock, or even a meteroid. i personaly would have to disagree with the people that think it was created by aliens do to the fact that there is not any proof that aliens even exsist. there is not even any proof that this but couldnt have been a meteroid, coment, or even rocks that hit mars.

in paragraph 3 it claims that a huge rock formation which resembles a human head. in the artical it even says that it most likely couldve been a rock. this is one of the reason why i agree with the way it wasnt formed by aliens it was a rock. alien are yet to be discovered where in this view u cant say that it was a alien it is not.
