One article say's ''Dose your expresion in the mirro suggest an emotion''? This talks about how easyer it would be to know how others feal. I think it may actiually be bad becaus some people like to not have there privacy invaded by other normal people using a computer. People like to keep there personal thoughts to them selves I don't like the idea of reading peoples mines. We should not do this becaus it might make things easyer at the same time harder. I don't think technology will make things easyer nomader what there will always be trouble.

The article is supporting this claim becaus they are curiuos and think things would be easyer with this new machine. They can use it to detect the fealings of old paintings like the Mona Lisa and they can use it on peole too. They want to use this for students they think it would help with there difficulties. I don't like this becaus too me it's like spying on somebody.

I think we should only use this for paintings like the Mona Lisa but not on people who are still alive. This would to me make people oncofortable. This is like invading someones privacy and being rude. Even when I disagree with this people will still use it all becaus they are so curious. I think it should only be used for certan things not for school or anything else.
