Dear Principle,

I think you should require students to do at least an hour a week on community service because the community always needs help and who would be better to help than us students. There are always going to be people that don't want to help because they think it is a waste of time but if we don't volunteer now we are just going to be more negative about helping those in need. I think we should help the community because it is a great way to get active and help those in need. Even if donating old clothes helps it should be considered community service because it is technically helping those in need.

Another reason why we should have community service is because it promotes self-confidence and a sense of respect towards those who already help and give to the community. That is good because if you have self-confidence then it can promote you to do other good things without being told to do so (like homework). I think community service can help those in need while helping those that help the community to be better people.

We can create a list of charity events and food drives and have other people add on to that list and have kids sign up to work charity events on the school campus. To make helping out more appealing to some students we could have monthly drawings for students that did two or more hours a week to win some sort of prize. To make sure that people are doing their service we could also have reference sheets that the kids would have to fill out about what they did and have it signed by the person they worked with.

I think that requiring community service would be a great idea for students because of all the benefits to our community from picking up trash or donating clothes to starting food drives and having carnivals for children with cancer or other diseases. Our community can benefit in any way and I think this is the way to trigger the charitable acts in the students here. We have the power to help the community so will you choose to make us help or not?

Sincerely,
