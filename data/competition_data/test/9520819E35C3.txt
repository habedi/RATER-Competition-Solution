"In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you." And that quote is by Sharon Heit, mother of texting and driving victim. This essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There is a lot of pros and cons, on if people should or shouldn't be able to use their cell phone well operating a vehicle. As a teenager I see the good and the bad, but it doesn't always means that us teenagers will always listen or bother to do the right thing.

In my opinion cell phones use while driving shouldn't be allowed. Manly because there are more cons then there are pros. And if I was driving I wouldn't be able to text anyone because I can't multitask. And if I got into a car accident I wouldn't be able to handle hurting anyone or possibly killing someone. And I'm the type of person that don't like pain or going to the hospital.

If you don't keep your attention on the road bad things can happen. Including put others life's in danger, putting your life in danger, braking hearts of others and sometimes you're on heart, going to court if the victim try's to sue you. An example of putting other peoples life in danger, let's say if your boyfriend or girlfriend texted you and you saw it and you replied, and you happen to take both hands off the wheel and it happen that you can't take control of the vehicle and you get in a car crash. Taken both hands off the wheel can also put you in danger as well. And getting into a car crash isn't always safe people can die on the scene and you couldn't do anything about it, so that brakes others heart and possible yours.

The pros of cellphone used while driving: navigation, traffic reports, crime reporting, communication with a friend or a parents or if you have children. Now days, the cars have navigation in them. And if they don't you can have cellphone holders for your phone. Communication with a friend or even a family member about something that's going on, and you're trying to get to where they are. And if you have children and you don't know where they are and you're trying to get a hold of them.

This essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. And I don't think people should drive and use there cell phone. There can be exception for using a phone when operated a vehicle. The exception can be about a death or a child, and of course navigation. And this is my opinion on if people should or shouldn't be able to operate a vehicle while driving.
