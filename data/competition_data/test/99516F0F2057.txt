The author starts by giving us examples how Earth and Venus are similar to eah other and giving us information how Venus could be a planet were they used to be life before. He or she was explaning the diffrences how the degrees are diffrent and their higher on Venus but he came to the conclusion that how it could be a livible planet. So on paragrah 5 the author says that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that they have the idea of sending people to explore it so this menas they are actually serious about this. The author explains how they are some bad stuff before sending people so they are comimg up with ideas how the mission can be complete with no failures so this mens that we have the knowledge but we dont have the right things to complete this mission. On paragraph 8 it blow my mind that hes actually right about how we are curios about anything we cant reach with our hands so we try harder to obtain the impossible, we have a huge universe but we will never be satisfy until we reach a dead end.
