Dear Principal,

I think that students that have a C average have the right to play sports and do other activities. The rule saying that students can't play in any sports and activities unless they are passing. The C average students are passing and it means that they can play sports or other activities.

If you establish this policy there will be less students participating in school activities. Not all students can be a B average and higher students, but they try there best to pass so they can participate in the school activities. The students that shouldn't play are the ones that have a D average or lower.

If you want the students to have a B average or higher talk to them and explain to them that if they start to have a lower grade than a C average they will not be able to play sports or participate in other school activities. The students then will want keep their grade up so they will not be forbid to participate in school activities.

Many students love to play sports and other school activities, but you will be denying the students who actually are passing and i think that is not right to deny them. They all want to keep playing sports and do school activities, but they can do that if you establish the policy that they all have to have a B average or higher to do what they love to do.

If you pass the policy there will be less students participating. If there are less students doing sports then that means that they don't have enough player to play against the other school, which means that the B average and higher students will not get to play either. The policy could affect not only the C average students, but the other students, too.

I recommend that you really think about the establishment of this policy because you will not be only affecting us the students, the students that make your school.

Sincerely,
