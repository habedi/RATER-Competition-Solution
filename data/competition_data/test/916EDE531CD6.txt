living in a communitiy where less and less people are using cars would be good for several reasonS. one reason is that there wil be far less pollution in the city and nearby areas. another advantage is that the town will be much quiter and noise pollution will go down. the best wouold probably be that there qwould be far less accidents. living in a city with little to no cars seems better then living in a city filled with cars.

noise and gas pollution is a major problem that cars and other vehicles create. so living in a car-free city Would be much cleAner and would Result In there being less smog and noxious gases in the atmosphere. alot of the world's pollution comes from cars. so by not drioving them in some places around the world we could cut down carbondioxide and other gas emmsions by alot. and with the absence of cars prople would not be annoyed by the sounds like they would be if cars were used in the community. and people would be able to sleep better or get more work done even.

the greatest advantage off all is that the death rate from car accidents would go down dramatically. so the population may even go up because of this and bring in more money for the city. there would also be alot less fear when crossing tghe street. and most places in the city are easily within walking or biking distanceÂ  and then cars would become useless since the streets in cities and towns are often conjested due to the overwhelming mass of cars. but if everyone biked or walked it would be much safer and calmer and the streets would be far less backed up.

in conclusion, using bikes or your feet as transportation is far better and just as if not even more effective the using vehicles like cars. using the no vehicle method has far more advantages then disadvantages.
