I don't think that it should be required to do community service. It could be something that a student would like to do or a student could do it for extra credit. If a student has done something that has broken school rules, then I would suggest community service. If they wanted to do it, then they could stay after school and help out. They could help the younger students with their homework or something similar to that. They should be able to choose what type of community service they would like to do. If nothing interests them, they should at least try something and see if they enjoy it.

In my opinion, if a student must do community service, it should be related to school. For example, they could help clean up their cafeteria or tutor another student who is struggling with a particular subject. If nothing of those interests the student, then they can always choose something else. If they would like to suggest another job, they should be able to do so. It's not that difficult to let a few students get together and think of an after school program for people who have to do community service.

If I had to do community service, I would most likely help out with tutoring. I would probably help out with math, for it has always been my best subject. It does get harder every year, but that should just make students work harder and get their work done. The teachers my also get stricter or they could be extremely helpful. I've found it to be about half and half. Every other year or so a teacher will come along and give you no help at all. They might just give you the work and tell you to do it. Other times, they can help you with any problem you seem to have. Either way, it IS required to get your work done.

All of these thoughts are just suggestions, but if they were used, I think it would be very helpful. They may or may not be good suggestions, but to me, their my thoughts and there isn't really a way for me not to think. When I do think about it, I think that they're good suggestions. That's just my opinion on my own thoughts, but again, they are just my thoughts. Also, I think that any one of these would be a good suggestion. And lastly, a student should not be made to do something. If they wish to do community service, they may. If not, that's their choice. If it's not required, then they cannot be made to do it.
