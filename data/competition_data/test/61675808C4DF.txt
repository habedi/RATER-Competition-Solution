Venus the second planet from the sun and very dangerous. A thick cloud of carbon dioxide and heats to high for the humen body, but desipite all of the dangers the autor of this passage still wants to go. Despite all of the dangers is this really worth to pursuit.

The aurtor gives us a idea in paragraph 3 of how dangerous Venus is. A 97% thick cloud of carbon dixoide. Heats high enough to kill a humen, up to eight hundred degress! Thunder storms with frequent lightnign strikes that would kill a humen if stuck by one. Lastly its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earths that would crush a submarine, machines built to withstand pressure! Many more dangers await us on Venus but the possiblity behind all of these dangers is amazing.

The reason the autor wants to go to Venus is just because of human curisotiy and insight of the planet itself theres no real claim for anything else. (NASA) is the only scientific reason stated but even then all the text the autor shows is making a craft to just hover over Venus nothing about actuly exploring the plant. The autor's aproche to this subject could have been more enhancing if they would have given scientfic reasons then just for human curisity.

Venus the sister to earth if she had deadly wepons and was ready to strike you if you got close. The autor makes good points on why we should go there but if you were to ask me I would build and wast recorses on this if this was the convincing paper.
