Community and service should be done by everyone at least once a week. community and service doesn't just benefit our lives but our environment.

When people say "I don't have time for community service" they should be ashamed. Community service is voluntary but it should be mandatory. Helping the community is a very big must especially now because the world is getting even more polluted. We need to take care of our world or else there will be none.

Teens today don't care about it because they want to do something fun like go watch a movie with friends or just hang out. Community and service can be fun as well. Teens should gather their friends to do community service. The bigger the group the more fun it will be. Weather it be raking leafs, planting trees or cleaning up a park everyone can hang out and can go home feeling good about it. Community service doesn't have to take up a lot of time maybe one day of the week you can set aside to doing something to help out the community. When you have nothing to do at home go for it, do some community service.

Community and service is needed desperately. We as a community need to step up our game to cleaning the earth or it will fall apart quickly. The world should be a pleasant place to live in. Lets make it happen.
