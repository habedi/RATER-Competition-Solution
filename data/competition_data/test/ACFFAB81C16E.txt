"Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free'--except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community." WHAT? I would never want to give up my car for anything. Yes maybe there are some advantages to living in a virtually car free zone but there are some downfalls as well.

Many kids play sports and neeed a car to get the to their practice or game because the walk is just to far. I drive to Clearwater, Fl every week to get to practice and I know i would not be able to walk that far with all my equipment in time. My life, as of many others, revolve around cars and count on them to get them to where they need to go. It's crazy to me how it says that "70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars..." I guess it is possible to live without a car.

Yet it is a good thing that more communities and cities are starting to do this to try and help the environment. Cars produce so much green house gases and that's why the environment is having such a hard time right now. All the gases that we produce such as cars, just get thrown up into the solar system and destroy our solar system. One woman that lives in this community stated "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." It proves that you don't need your own personalo vehicle as it just causes stress. If it's working for these people, it will begin to work for more communities that are changing to be like this and possibly, all communities will be like this.

Imagine your life without a car. See the good things about it and the bad things. That's why I was so shocked to read this article since they just gave up cars. It wouldn't hurt to try it.
