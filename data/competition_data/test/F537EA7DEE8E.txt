Dear Principle,

I personally think that you should require all the students from our school to do community services for many reasons. One reason is that it will teach you a lesson , also that it will keep students from doing bad things and it will influence younger kids to do not litter because if they do they will have to do community serves also in the future.

Doing community services is good for you because you are helping others and helping others will show you how people are in need wich will lead to energies wich will be used to help others in the future.

The other reason is also that it will keep students from being outside. Being outside of your home means that there are people that don't want you and that will lead you in the bad path and doing community serves will keep you from going in the bad direction.

The last reason why i think that you should require all students to do community serves is that it will influence little kids to not litre because then they will do community serves
