Everyone needs to help out and join the Seagoing Cowboys program! I believe we can make a difference in the world. You can explore new places while helping countries recover from the war. You can make it like a family vacation and have your whole family help. You can spend time with them.

When I joined the program i was excited to explore and help countries. I was on a trip to Greece and before we arrived I was 18 years old. That means i was old enough to get recruited. My draft board figured out I was on a cattle-boat trip they told me to stay there and keep helping. I was excited to keep doing what I love. I was discharged in 1947. In that time i made nine trips. Thats the most of any seagoing cowboy. I saw many countries like Europe and China. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece. That was special to me. On rides home the crew would play baseball or volleyball on board and many more games. I'm very grateful for this opportunity. It has opened up the world to me! That was the best experience of my life. You should really try it out. I bet you would love it.
