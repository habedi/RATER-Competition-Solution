Students would benefit way more if they had access to class from home. Students like myself hate waking up at 5:30am, 6:00, or earlier, some students would get more work done, and students wouldnt get in as much trouble. Taking your classes online has its pros and cons. Some students like taking online classes and some dont. If they offered online classes everywhere it would be very beneficial to the academic scene.

Most students hate waking up at 5:30, 6:00, 6:30 in the morning. But with online classes students can wake up at a more reasonable time and take the class whenever they want. Waking up that early and going to school everyday is stressful for most students. Some students struggle to make it to school/class on time because they wake up late. For example, I slept through my alarm and I woke up 45 minutes later than i should have woken up. I missed my ride and I was tired and late to class. Most students are tired because some dont get a full nights rest of sleep. Some might go to sleep at 11:00 or 12 at midnight due to their jobs or their personal life.

Students would get more work done. Most students would get their work done more consistently. Some students hate the fact that work has to be due on the same day or they're rushed out of their comfortable pace to work on their classwork/homework and turn it in. Some students work slow and teachers dont understand that sometimes. For example, some students didnt finish a project that was due in 3 days and the teacher didnt care and gave them all zeros because they couldnt work at her pace.

Most students wouldnt get in as much trouble. Some students get in trouble because of their friends and sometimes because of the teachers at the school. Sometimes the teachers are disrespectful and causes the student to get angry and lash out. Most of the times its their friends that make them do dumb stuff and make them get suspended and miss school. If students did online school they would be controlled by someone they will listen to. Students hate listening to teachers and thats why they get in trouble too.

Schools should offer online school worldwide because most students hate waking up at 5:30, 6:00, 6:30 in the morning, students would get more work done, most students wouldnt get in as much trouble. Overall online school is benefical for everyone. Students would be more comfortable in a enviroment their comfortable with rather than a random place they have to go to.
