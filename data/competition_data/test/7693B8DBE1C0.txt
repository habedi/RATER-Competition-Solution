Dear Principal,

I think making a policy stating in order to play a sport a student must have a B average is an amazing idea. It would pressure students to get better grades, make the school better know for it's great grade point averages, and would inspire the smarter kids to get more involved in sports. This policy could do wonders for the student body.

First of all, this policy would pressure students to get better grades. Not everyone can get A' s and B' s with flying colors. They may need a little work and enforcing this policy will give some students the drive to keep trying.

Second of all, it would help the school have a better reputation. The better grades the students have the smarter the school seems. If more grades improve more people can learn about the policy. Not only the people in the school but the people outside the school too. Therefore, more parents would want to enroll their children in the school.

Finally, policies like this can include the smarter kids in school to get more athletically active. Not only athletically active but socially active also. They can tutor other students to help them come above their low averages.

All in all, I believe this policy could really improve the school. By getting the students better grades, giving the school a good name, and giving smarter people the chance to shine. This policy is an incredible idea. Who would disagree?
