Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend class from home, because they can be responsible to attend classed from home, always learn new things, and always study.

First of all, be responsible to attend classes from home because there is a lot of people that are not responsible on their education especially attending classes from home. For instance, someone being home school needs responsibility.

Second of all, students always learn new things while they are being attended classed from home. For instance, while they are paying attention on the things they are teaching to the student theirs always new things to learn and interesting things to know what is about.

Third of all, always study on the things they might ask you on. For instance, you might take quizzes just to know how much you know on the things you learned.

Finally, get your work done on time so you can be able to pass and start on new things. For instance, if you don't get your work done on time you will be behind and not be able to pass on the new things to learn.

In conclusion, some people think it would not benefit students being able to attend classes from home because they won't be responsible, always going to forget, and not doing what they are suppose to do.
