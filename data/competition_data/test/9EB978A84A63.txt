Should Drivers Be on Their Phone While Driving

Smartphones have become a huge part in everyday life ranging from making a simple call to playing online games. With this era it's rare not to see someone constantly checking their notification even in the most parcul ior area. Even with smartphones having this high tech specs making everyday life simple, many people fear that smartphones are taking over lifes and endangering the health of the people. A prime example is whether or not drivers should be using smartphones while operating a vehicle?

There are those who believe its common sense to not turn on a phone while driving and there are those who say phone make commutes easier for them. Should drivers not look through their phones while operating a vehicle.

Smart Devices has made the daily life of people's simple from making calculation to having video chat with friends or family. This is where many people spend their time looking at post and trying to get likes for their pictures. We even seen videos of other not looking were their going and bumping into poles or even getting hit by drivers. But getting distracted by just a simple whistle from a phone has created a blur line between on looking at that notification or keeping a stable mind. Walking while texting is a problem, but texting while driving has became a national issue where many states are trying to combat this issue, even average citizens are raising awareness to this problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or NHTSA has stated that texting while driving has risen over the past decade as more incidents are revealed that the driver were on his/her phone before the accident. Even with a decrease in accident by 2 percent in late 2017 the NHTSA has confirmed that 73% of accidents are due to distracted drivers. This caught the attention of States realising that the number of accidents are rising leading them to take measures to prevent more fatal accident. A prime example is Georgia as they became one of 16 states to ban phones while operating a vehicle. This comes as many news outlet and even will known news station reported of a fatal accident in Georgia where three college student lost their life in a fatal car accident. The reason this became a national news was what happen before the accident which lead to lives being lost. What happen was the result of a poor decision made by the driver who ultimately ended the life of three friends. What this drive did was selfish and irresponsible as the driver before the accident was going top speed of over 100 mph and on their phone.

Why they did this was a result of wanting to have a good Snap for the most popular app Snapchat so friends can watch. What comes after was tragic, leading to Georgia to place House Bill 673 or The Hands-Free Georgia Act that became effect in July 1, 2018. But why has distracted drivers risen over the past decade even if they know the consequences that comes with it.

Studies from universities revealed that looking at your phone has become an addiction for so many, it has ever beaten people who use illegal substance and smokers.

California State University tested on why people are addicted to smartphones by creating a little experiment. This experiment was sending countless messages to a volunteer, but the catch was to place the phone out of reach of the volunteer. What they found was a spike in the heart and the breathing pattern changing. They keep on changing by each notification that was being sent. In this case, the anxiety was caused by withdrawal from an addiction. Why do people get addicted will it's this substance called dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical within the brain that gives use this happy feeling when we hear that notification ringing in our pocket. This is why people are addicted to their phones because they don't realize that the ring of a phone activates the Dopamine. No matter how hard a person tries to not look through their phone the brain gives of this anxiety of not knowing what will happen if they don't look. Why do people value their phones more than others is a good question.

This is where it come to play when discussing whether or not drivers should be using their phones while driving. Even with states placing laws to prevent accidents from occurring, this hasn't stopped those few from looking through his/her phone will on the road. Will all been part of this looking through your phone waiting for that special someone to text back. But is it possible to stop drivers from checking their phone completely, will this is based on the moral of those who feel like that text is more important than human lifes. No matter how hard official warn about the dangers of texting, they ultimately fall into deaf ears or those who believe this will never happen to them. The only way phone driving accident will decreases is by having people recognize what they are doing, because even with laws put in place it fall into people hands in whether they will obey or fall into their selfish needs.
