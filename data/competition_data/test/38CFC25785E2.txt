Lets be honest, there is nothing like being in the comfort of your own bed. Well, there is now a way one can learn while never leaving the comfort of your own home. Distance learning has taught many a way of online or video conferencing has shown how one can adapt with new technologies. Students would benefit from being able to work in the comfort of their own homes, or anywhere in the world!

If a student has been absent distance learning is a great option. Students that are out with an illness are typically out for a few days to a week, per doctor orders, and have make-up work waiting on them when they come back to school. Students easily fall behind and get overwhelmed when they miss school. By using video conferencing any student could easily catch up and get back on normal track.

There are parts of the year where in climate weather is a large idea that many staff and students look forward to because of school closings. The make up work and possible add-on days in the school year are something most people do not look forward to. Being able to attend classes at home during the school cancellations would fix a majority of the additions because students would get work done, not fall behind in any lessons and teachers would still be able to teach and put grades in.

Many students may not have internet access abilities, or even computers at home. The school system could supply all of the students with laptops so that every student could be provided with one in case of distance learning.

Being able to attend class from home is very convenient not only for the students but also for the staff. Schools should start considering the idea of distant learning. Many school districts can host fundraisers to save money for the laptops like can drives, car washes, and sell t-shirts! There are lots of fun fundraiser ideas to get every school involved!
