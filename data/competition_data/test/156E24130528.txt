Do you think it is more beneficial for student to attend school from home trough an online course or attend physical school. Online school provides a variety of benefits that regular school cant compare to and there is many reasons for but mainly it is because of the stress school holds

Students can get the same education they need from school without all the rules and directions that apply when in school in an online course on a computer. Some students do not enjoy the feeling of being around a lot of people get flustered which can hinder students learning and decrease their overall performance in school an online school program, which you can attend from the comfort of your home where you feel calm, could greatly benefit these types of students with the problems they have and would completely erase these obstacles.

If the world changed the education system to mainly online school, parents would be relived of the stress of finding transportation to and from their school they so choose and also waking up these children at very early times in the morning.

Online students will be at home rather than at a building for 6 hours and be able to feel free and not constrained for example if a student needs a brake from there work they could simply go for a walk or get snack but this is not possible for physical schools,leaving the property of school holds severe consequences and most of the time the only brakes you can get in school are either to get water,bathroom and the cafeteria which is not a healthy option of food.

Some people may argue that physical school provides a real world experience with being around people,having teamwork and following rules. Despite these reasons students can still this experience. The people you live with you have to work together with and follow your parents rules for the house and you still have to follow overall life rules so without physical school you can still get the same experience.

In conclusion the benefits from a online school are far greater than a physical one. If online schools were the main option for education the world would benefit greatly.
