Hi and im Luke and I am in a program called the Seagoing Cowboys. The UNRRA hired us to take care of horses,and young cows,that we ship overseas. My friend and I joined together. You may or may have not heard of it.

The seagoing cowboys are a group that helps countries recover the food suplies, animal, and lots more. We bring three houndred and thirty five horses with enough oats to feed them to the people. I think you should join them now to help people in need.

There are many reasons to join this amazing group. There are many reasons that you should join. One is you get to help people. But you benefit yourself by helping people in need. You also get to sightsee. At the different places you go. I got to go see the Acropolis in Athens Greece. I also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city filled with water and finally I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marvleled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Some other reasons are that you get to sleep in a boat you don't do that very often. Finally on return trips after the animals have been unloaded you play games. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals were. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

But being one is more gratefull for me than an adventure. It opened up the whole world to me. "I am gratefull for this oppurtunity" I say "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."

But being a Seagoing cowboy has some dangers. This is during World War Two so enemy soldiers could be roaming around. Or also when i was on the boat. I was a watchman. My job was to check on the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to my captain, I slid down a slippery lader on my backside of the ship. A small strip of metal along the side kept me from slidding in to the dark Atlantic. I am happy to be alive. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

I hope you take this into consideration on joining the Seagoing Cowboys to help other people. Also be with your friends and have fun.
