Us students who are participating in sports for our school should be able to play in our sports if we have a C average. Why would just our school change? The other schools were playing against wouldn't change their grade averages.

We would be held to higher standards then the other schools we compete against.

This isn't fair to us as students, most of us already have a B average but if we maybe bomb a test or do bad on a homework assignment that would maybe make a player miss a game? For one little homework assignment?

We wouldn't want that to happened to us.

With a B average there would be some advantages to it too, other schools would give us more respect, teachers would give us more respect for getting our homework done and winning the game we played the day before.

If we raised the average to a B, us students should have a higher expectation as the other students in our school and be able to maybe miss one homework assignment during the season and not let it affect our grade so much.

But with a C average instead of a B it gives you a little more comfort room, so if you bomb a test, do bad on a homework assignment, you wouldn't miss a game, practice or tournament.

This allows our student athletes to focus on school and their sport they're participating in and do as best as they possibly can in both of these categories. Instead of missing a game the student might be able to retake the test and get a higher score.

We student athletes feel it's unfair to give us higher expectations then the other student athletes around us, the we compete against. This would give the other schools an advantage to practice their sport extra time while were trying to study for a retake test that we didn't do so good on.

Everyone in the district should be held to the same standards, same rules and same expectations.

There would be more disadvantages to the students if this rule was put into affect, i think for now, we should stick with a C average and maybe next year, as a district make a decision so not only one school is held to higher standards and expectations compared to the other schools around it.
