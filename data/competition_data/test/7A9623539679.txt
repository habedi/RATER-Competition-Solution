You may have seen venus, or sometimes called te "Evening Star", as you were stargazing, but did you know its actually a planet. Venus is also our twin in relations to density and size. It is also a planet worth exploring or pursuiting because of how much it is like Earth.

Venus is very similar to Earth in regards to size and density. This is one reasons why it's worth pursuiting. In the article it states that, "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." If Venus was like Earth long ago we can learn from it and figure out why it changed into a very hot and into unhabital conditions. Venus is also worhty of exploring because NASA has an idea on how to send humans to Venus. If they were to successfully send someone to Venus the advancement in technology would be astounding.

Exploring Venus does seem like a good idea but have you thought of the dangers of doing so. Venus' average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide. That is very dangerous conditions for a spacecraft let alone a human. In the article it says, "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." If a spacecraft can't even do it, can a human?

Yes it is very dangerous to explore Venus but the outcome weighs out the danger. If Venus is Earth's twin then Earth could do the samething. We need to research and explore the planet so we can see if they samething could happen to Earth. This can also give people at NASA a challenge to create something or some kind of ship that can withstand the harsh conditions. This could help with technology advancement and with the technology we may be able to go to place we've never been before.

Exploring Venus is worth it because of all the advanement that could happen. With exploring Venus can lead to so many possibilities. It can help with exploring other planets and maybe learn more about ours. It does pose a lot of risks but I feel like the outcome is greater than the risks.
