in german suburbs residents are pioneers and they have given up thier cars to stop all the busy crowded parking. even though owning a car is aloud they still dont do it because it is safer for the children and enviroment . they are also trying to put a message put to the world . more than 70 percent of the vaubans famileis do not have cars .

the cars in europe cause a fair percentage of the greenn house gases . passanger cars alone cause 12 perecent of the gases alone . and up to 50 perecent in some car-instensive places in the us . it is better for the inviroment for there tho be less gas emmisions .

in some places such as paris there is so much gasx emisionds that they have banned all driving . the reason being is there is so much smog from vehicals its not healthy to live in or nothing .

In bogota columbia there is a all day car free day . this means the goal for everyone is to do not use a motorized vehicle all day and violtors will be fined 25 dollor fines if they us a vehicles . the hope for that program is to go world wide or to atleast spread to more coumtries.

What the goal is for this passage is to get everyone to go without cars and just use bicycles or walk or somthing along those lines.
