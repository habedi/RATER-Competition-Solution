"The Challenge of Exploring Venus" gives the idea to study Venus despite all the dangers Venus has going on. A reason why we should give studying Venus a try is because it has been the most Earth like planet that's in our solar system (paragraph 4). Another reason we should give Venus a try is because it may have harsh conditions and tempuratures but we could find a way around it (paragraph 5). Venus seems very intresting and new to explore and possible live on some day.

Venus is one of the most Earth like planets. For example, Venus seems like it was once covered by oceans and a lot of water (paragraph 4). Venus also has features like the Earth like rocky sediment, valleys, mountains and craters (paragraph 4).

Another reason why Venus is Earth like is because it may have also once held life very long ago (paragraph 4). Venus also has many other reasons we should visit the planet.

Venus can and may look a little intimidating but we have found some ways to work around that. NASA is working on allowing scientist to float above the fray ( paragraph 5). They are also working on solar power so we could benefit from it and it wouldn't exceed Earth's levels at all ( paragraph 5). Lastly, NASA is testing electronics made of silicon carbide in a chamber to see how Venus would react to it, suprisingly its lasted three weeks in the conditions ( paragraph 7). Venus has a lot of conditions different and the same but NASA and other scientist are testing new things out to really figure things out.

In conclusion, Venus has many features the same as Earth it self and NASA is working and testing new things to see if we could possible live on Venus some day in the future. Venus seems like we shouldn't risk going there because how different some of the features are but Venus is survivable for humans. Venus is worth giving it a shot even if we still are not sure about certain things because it could possibly benefit us all in a certain way.
