One of the hardest things for a student to do is feel comfortable in their school environment. Whether a student is extremely insecure, has low grades, or does not have that many friends, they often struggle to thrive in school. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is a way to solve this problem because students will feel safer and like they belong at school. Students participating in a club will have the opportunity to meet new people. Additionally, students will benefit physically because of the positive health factors that they will get out of participating in a club. My personal experience has taught me all the benefits of joining an extracurricular activity as well.

If students participate in an extracurricular activity, they are very likely to meet new people. Members may become friends with people who they would not have met if they were not in a club. Often, students in the same club have similar interests, and will become close friends. These friends will prove to be very helpful throughout students' lives. Students will also have the opportunity to meet students that differ from them. These students may be older, younger, a different race, or a different religion. Students that have a relationship with someone that is different from them are benefited because they see different perspectives and are exposed to different cultures. Lastly, members of a club will become closer with adults, like coaches or teachers. The students will have someone they can trust, talk to, and look up to. This shows that requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is a good decision because they can meet new, diverse people.

Another advantage of being a member of a club is the health benefits the activity provides. Sports, marching band, and many other clubs require physical activity. This will help students stay fit and healthy. Secondly, talking to someone, for example a new friend or trusted adult whom you met through the club, helps reduce stress. Exercising is also proven to help decrease the anxiety that builds up in students' lives. If a student is rid of stress and anxiety, they will be more positive and friendly. Additionally, if some members of the extracurricular activity have healthy eating habits, it is likely that they will encourage the rest of the members to eat healthy. This, like exercise, will keep a student happy and energetic. The positive health factors are another reason that enforcing the participation of students in clubs is beneficial.

I have participated in an extracurricular activity for several years, and I can say that these benefits, among others, have helped me through elementary school and middle school. In the spring of my third grade year, I walked into school and was greeted by my best friend. She shoved a flier into my hands and explained that we were trying out for the soccer team, and she wouldn't take "no" for an answer. We tried out for the school's soccer team and eventually got notified that we had made it as starters, players who begin playing on the field for each game. If not for that push by my friend, I would not be playing soccer for one of the best clubs in Generic_City. Playing soccer has helped me make new friends, stay healthy, and reduce a lot of my stress. My experience has shown me all the benefits of participating in an extracurricular activity, and I hope other students can experience this too.

Students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of the several positive advantages that come from it. The members of the clubs will meet new and different people. Students' health will benefit as well because they will be physically active and their stress will be reduced. Additionally, I have been participating in an extracurricular activity for five years and it has helped me socially, mentally, and physically. Next time you have the opportunity, encourage a student to join a club because it will positively change their lives for good.
