Dear principal,

I think that the new school policy about students with at least a B average can only participate in sports or other activities is unfair. The reason I think this is because most students have C averages and are great athletes. Also to some people C averages are okay. I think that most people with C averages probably failed a test or didn't bring in some homeworks and the reasons to punish them to not being in sports is absurd.

Sometimes students have a C+ and then it goes up or a C+ and they don't have time to make it up. I mean this never happened to me because I don't make C's or anything lower but telling people that they cannot join a sports team for it is so unreasonable.

Another specific reason Is that people just don't have time or can't study. I think maybe having the team a little later when students get used to their studying and planning , then grades of school athletes might get better.

The only thing I am arguing for is changing the policy from a B average to a C average because unless you don't want great athletes if so then I say you change it !
