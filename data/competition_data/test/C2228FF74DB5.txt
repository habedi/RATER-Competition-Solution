Technology has affected everything in our world as of now. How we see, move and even think has all been affected by technology. How we learn has also been affected with the help of a gift called the internet. Now people can take classes online at home instead of going into the classroom ;however, this is not always the best choice for students. There are those who argue that online learning does benefit students, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, online classes do not benefit students.

There are many reasons why online classes do not benefit students. One of which is that there are a plethora of distractions at home that can take a student's mind off of their class, such as a family. If there are younger people in the home, them they may call the student for help, or simply want their attention. Older people may call for help as well, especially the elderly. Even more so, blackouts and technical issues may interrupt the class and cause the student to lose focus. All of these stimuli can make online learning a challenge for people at home. Another issue with online learning is that the class is usually only a single student and a single teacher. This raises a concern for those who simply cannot learn like that. Groups allow ideas and knowledge to flow, amplifying the learning process. Unfortunately, online learning was not designed for group work, in fact, it would be extremely difficult to work on a project with others in an online class. At home classes also hinder the ability to have hands on work. Many classes, such as chemistry and physics, cannot even be taught online since the laboratory experiments so essential to the class can only be seen through a screen and not physically done by the pupil them self.

There are even more reasons why online classes do not benefit many students. These classes tend to be expensive, especially for upperclassmen. Some families are unable to afford the course, let alone the device the classes need to take place on and the potential need for WiFi and any other physical materials. These online classes also have a major flaw: it amplifies the student's ability to procrastinate. Since the student is at home, they can easily put off many assignments to do later, and the setting of the home gives them many excuses to chose from. Moreover, these online classes lack the physical presence of a teacher, and therefore the teacher-student bond many traditional classrooms have is not there. This may discourage the student from actually retaining the information that is given through a screen.

Although many disagree, online courses do not benefit students. The distractions of the home, inability to work in groups, and the strengthened ability of procrastination are just a few of the many drawbacks of learning online. There are still those out there in the world who would still argue that online learning does benefit students, however, they would be wrong. As technology grows better and faster than ever before, many people will have to make choices based on their specific needs and abilities.
