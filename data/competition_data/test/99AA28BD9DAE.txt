Have you ever felt like you need to spend time with your pets? Do you ever feel like you need to make a difference in the world, for animals and humans alike? Well then join the "Seagoing Cowboys" of thje UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) today! You will get a one in a lifetime chance while spending time overseas, traveling to new countries, and spend all of that time with horses, young cows, and mules. Not only are you going to travel to new places, you will also see many different sights you may never see again. After a hard day at sea caring for different animals you can play games, have a variety of different sports tournaments, or just play rounds of games such as basketball or volleyball.

While most people don't call fun feeding and watering horses, there is much more to being a "Seagoing Cowboy" that just that. After your turn to feed or water that animals is over, board games or even just playing with a deck of cards are options. After you get off of the ship there are hundreds of activities and tourists attractions in the different countries such as Greece, China, Crete, and many more places all around the world that you can see and do. In Crete there are ancient Greek castles in ruins, in Greece you can see the Acropolis (which was a very special occasion for me). I even took a gondala ride in Venice, Italy. Doing this job has many benefits other than just helping horses and other animals.

On top of all of those reasons for being fun, I also had a great time spending time with the animals. Doing this job isn't as simple as it sounds though. I had to know when you need to feed or water the animals (which is two to three times a day) and I also had to make sure they didn't get sick on the voyage. On top of that you also have to carry the hay and oats for 335 different animals onto the ship. But, although it's not easy, it still was a lot of fun for me and I'm guessing it was also fun for the other people that went on the trip too. I enjoyed this job so much, I did it nine times because it was so much fun. I enjoyed doing it so much I did it the most out of anyone, and I think you will too.

The final reason I think you will enjoy doing this is because this trip is a one in a lifetime opportunity. Some people have never been on an airplane, some people have never been on a boat, but this is different. This is more than just a family vacation. This is an opportunity do something different. This is a chance to go do something most people have never done before. While you may have plans to go to a different state, or a different country, how many people have ever said "I want to travel across the seas with hundreds of different animals just to ship them to a different country." This is not something everyone gets to do. Make it something you get to do.

This is something everyone should want to do and I just gave you three reasons why you should do it. This is a one time time chance to do something most people have never done. Join the "Seagoing Cowboys" today for the best vacation a person can have.
