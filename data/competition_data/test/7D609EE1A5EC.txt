Dear School Principle,

Concerning the possible policy change, I feel that it is fair to only allow B average students or better into school sports and other activities. Good grades are far more important than a good football team. Would you rather attend the school with the good football team or the school that ranks among the top schools in your city in the category of education?

If a student really wanted to be on the school basketball team, he could easily place more focus on his school work as opposed to video games. A C average generally means you either have all C's or you have at least one D. How do you get a D unless you're not trying? If you're getting a D, you may as well be failing. I totally agree that students should not be allowed to participate in sports if they can't do what they were sent to school to do. You are at a school because you need to learn and learning should be a student's main focus.

For a student to complain that they have to do better in order to participate in school activities is just ridiculous. As a student, I go to school to learn. Sports and other extra-curricular activities are just fun things on the side. Why should I be allowed to play on the basketball team if I only have a C average? I'm sure there's another side to this argument but it's probably not a very good one. Academics are more important than athletics.

Sincerely, Random Student
