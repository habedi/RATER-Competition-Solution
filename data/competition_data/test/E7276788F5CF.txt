The author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursuit the dangers it presents. The author thinks that it's worth exploring Venus no matter the dangerous a human may go through. The author did not so good in explaining his opinion. He mentions only cons through out mayority of the article.

First the author mentions that Venus is Earth's twin closest plant in term of density and sizes and closest to distance too. But this hasn't been much of help, the fact that none spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. Secondly Venus is covered in a thick atmospher of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide making it hard for us to see through a spacecraft camera. Then on Venus suface temperatures are around 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than Earth's. The conditions on Venus are more far extreme than what a human can experiance on Earth. NASA has tried serval ways to study Venus, for example peering at Venus from hovering safetly far above the plantet can provide limited insight on ground conditions because the light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Exploring Venus is a challengeing planet for humans to study.

In my opinion this article does not explain why it's worth studying Venus no matter the risks. The author just talked about all the cons Venus has, the diffculties, the conditions of weather and all kinds of dangerous Venus provides. This just makes us think that just maybe it's not worth risking yourself having in mind this mission might fail as well.
