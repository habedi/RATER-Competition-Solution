The face that appers on mars is just a rock. I want to convience you that it's just a weird shape on mars. The shadows on the "Face" that shows the eyes, mouth, and nose is just plain shadows. According to the text "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shodows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This explains how the face is really but from a far distance it's not what you think.

Even on websites, it shows just a normal landform. Something could look different from far away, then up close. Like in the story a group of people went in 1997, and they said it looked like it was an alien artifact. But a year later in1998, it was sharper then that passed year when they took the first picture.

This explains that the "Face" is really not a face, and that it wasn't created by aliens. It was just a simple rock with some shadows reflecting or illusions on the rock to make it look like a face. It was just a regular landform.
