Pollution as we all know is a growing concern in our world today. There have been many efforts to decrease and try to ultimitley end pollution from recyclicng to not leaving your rooms light on. But the perhaps the best idea is that of car free towns and days to decrease pollution. Many countries have already statred these ideas and the turnout had been rirdiculously successful.

Limiting car use is also a great way to stop traffic congestion in rush hours and reduse smog in big cities. For example, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer states, "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France." This piece of text shows how reducing car usage can slow traffic jams and make driving around faster and easier.

Another great reason for limiting car use is that 50 percent of the pollution in the United States is from gas emissions. That is why in order to protect our countries enviroment and even our planets the limitation of car use is necessary and even vital.

In all the limitation of car use is a great plan to stop pollution and make roads easier to be driven and through and even safer many other countries have done so and it has been successful so it our turn to try it out.
