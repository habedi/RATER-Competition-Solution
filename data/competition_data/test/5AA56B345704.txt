Waking up and going to school is one of the most dreaded parts of the average student's life.

From cold and rainy weather to the hours of uncomfortable classrooms, students find many components that make school feel miserable.

But, what if all of the horrible parts of school could be removed?

By providing online classes for students to take at home, several of the tedious problems associated with school would be eliminated.

Allowing students to learn online would provide many advantages, including better time management, greater availability, and the creation of a stress-free environment.

The first benefit of at-home education would be the superior use of time. One of the biggest problems students have is the lack of sleep.

The modern student usually has to stay up late in order to finish their homework and attend to extra responsibilities.

Their full schedule, coupled with the early hour they must wake up to get to school on time, results in an epidemic of sleep deprivation. When a student lacks sleep, an important component of their health, their performance in school begins to suffer. Their ability to concentrate and retain information decreases drastically.

By providing classes at home, a student can easily implement a far healthier sleep schedule.

Without long transportation distances or elaborate preparation rituals, hours of a student's morning would be re-purposed for sleep. Eliminating transportation would also help the student utilize their time better. Instead of driving from place to place, a student would be able to use that period to work on school or other extracurricular activities.

Providing online classes at home would help students to get work done quicker and more efficiently.

Another benefit of attending classes at home is availability.

As students get older, they find themselves taking on more and more responsibilities.

Teenagers might get a job, pick up a sport, start volunteering, or even have to take care of their family.

With all of these time-consuming extracurricular activities, it is difficult to participate in everything and succeed in school.

But, working on their education from home opens the door to many opportunities.

Online classes pride themselves on allowing students to work at their own pace.

This means if a student has other priorities, they are free to attend to them without the stress of missing school.

Taking classes online also helps the student learn regardless of circumstances. The modern individual can expect many obstacles in their lifetime, making school attendance a challenge.

From bad weather blocking transportation to an out-of-town family trip, there are many reasons a student would not be able to attend traditional school.

Online resources would eliminate missing class.

Rather than the student going to school, the school would always be available to the student.

Regardless of the circumstances, the student would remain on track with the curriculum.

The final way that at-home school would benefit students is by creating a relaxed, stress-free environment.

School can be extremely intimidating, especially to less socially outgoing individuals. It is very common for students to perform poorly because they fear embarrassment in front of their peers or teachers. Online school taken at home would be a less stressful experience for students. The peers and teachers would not be able to judge the student based on appearance or interests, giving the students the opportunity to learn to the best of their ability.

This style of teaching would also significantly boost the student's confidence.

Without having to compare themselves to others, the student would gradually become more sure of their abilities and intelligence. The experience would also decrease stress by making a relaxed test-taking atmosphere.

Many students would find themselves getting bad grades on tests, quizzes, and exams because they struggle in a standard test-taking environment. By taking away the intimidating of traditional tests, the student has the opportunity to truly do their best.

While traditional school has been a successful system for millions of students, it may not be the best for everyone. Online classes taken at home provides a great alternative for individuals who require flexibility in their education.
