Dear Principle,

I believe that you should not go with changing it from a "B" average to a "C" average. For example, most students have a "C" average and this would not be fair for them. Unless you provide these student with free tutoring then make it a "B" average. For example, if a student has a "C" average they will not be able to participate in these activities and the leaders of this country are already complaining about obesity.

For starters, these most students have a "C" average and it will not be fair. You might not know if these students have issues or struggle keeping this "C" average. They might have issues at home that distract them from getting better grades. In some cases the students might have learning disabilities that keep them from improving in school.

Yes i know it would be asking too much to provide these students with private tutors, but that is what might give them the little extra help that they need. and lets say that the school doesn't have enough funding to give these students the help they need. Then you cannot make the average grade for them to participate in these activities higher.

Lets say that these student cannot play in these after school activities and they just give up on sports because they know that they have to maintain such a high grade average and they get overweight. this will happen from the lack of exercise that the children have. I am pretty sure this is not what the country wants for its future.

I hope that you understand what I am trying to say. It would be harder for these students to do what they love. It can also do bad things for their health. It would make students more lazy, and other things that can harm them or make them feel bad or angry.
