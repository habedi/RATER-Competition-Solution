If someone wishes to travel somewhere, such as a normal commute, proably the first transportation method they think of is a car. Cars are everywhere. They're the things hiding in a home, waiting for someone to enter the depths of the dark garage. Unless the grage is truly empty of the world-killing machiene, such as in Vauban, Germany where people have done the unthinkable: got rid off cars.

Though it may sound proposterous, or even critically insane to even concider giving up a car, the citizens of Vauban are a lot happier to be rid of the burden. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happpier this way" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). As you may have forgotten, car payments, maintnance, check up, oil changes, and gas are all part of owning a car which may be a financial strain for most.

Again, those robots that you move with pedals and a steering wheel are seriously affecting our Earth. We're Earth murderers. "Passenger cars arw responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). Fellow humans, we are not the only species on planet Earth. We are so used to cars it's like watching something interesting on TV and trying to pull away from it; it's nearly impossible. "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clean the air of the global city" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). Less driving cars is less greenhouse gasses that destroy our Earth.

In our society today, cars are the dominant transportation method. When you go outside in today's world it is most likely not the sound of nature, but a manmade vehicle. Without cars, a whole new world will come forth, or most likely the beautiful world we forgot about that is mercilessly trapped beneath unessesary layers of greenhouse gases. When Paris banned cars, it improved the pollution stuck in the air. "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French part to recind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). If we stop driving cars, it will help most people financially, help our Earth, and ease the worry and stress over the maintenance of a car. Once again, we are not the only species on Earth. Can't we all just share?
