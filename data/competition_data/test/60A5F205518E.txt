Driverless cars should be apart of everyday technology. Just as smart phones and robots become the norm, diverless cars are soon to follow; and, while people are soon to resent the ideas of a driverless car, they ignore the benefits and superiority of such an advance.

Driverless cars aren't completely driverless. This is adetail many are quick to overlook. In complete honesty, this is actually beneficial. While the car does the easier work of navigating through regular traffic and clear roads, it requires the driver's attention on more pressing issues such as construction or slick roads. This builds on a driver's sense of awareness, enabling them to be more skilled.

Another benefit is the increasment of safety. Drivers who are frequent to texting and driving are imediately pulled from the screen of their smart phone to the attention of their surrounding by the simple gestures frm the car. This means less accidents on the driver's end.

However, there is also a bad side to driverless vehicles. Humans may be prone to ignoring or missing the signals given by the car to take over. This could result in damage and/or injuries. There could also be a malfunction in the car making a signal delayed or not even appear at all. These are a few holes that make people doubt the effeciancy of this technology.

But no matter the bad, there are always positives that shine through. Driverless cars are the future. There is no way to avoid advancing. As the old sayinf goes, "Out with the old, in with the new."
