As an owner and constant user of a cell phone, I think that Policy #1 is the better choice for the Principal. Not just because it'd 'be cool,' etc., but because I think that a cell phone really can't be of harm during a free period. Obviously, there must be restrictions on cell phones during the school day, but at lunch, all I'm doing is eating. On numerous occasions I have found that I need to remind my mother of something(yes, my mother does text,), and I am forced to wait until the end of the school day and until I'm outside of the school to remind her. Usually it's too late at that point. Of course, this is still a privilege as a cell phone is an electronic and can disrupt the learning of others and the teacher, and should not be abused. If children are seen constantly taking advantage of this policy, then it should be repealed. Furthermore, if there is one case of cyber-bullying after this policy is put into effect, then they should revoke it. Also, phones are mainly intended for emergencies, and emergencies can happen at school. If the principal was to enforce Policy 2, there could be consequences. All in all, I'd say that Policy 1 in my opinion is the better choice. It would probably boost student morale and the students' view of the school as well.
