Have you ever drove down the highway or just been at a red light and look over and see all the people with cell phones up to their head or in their lap looking down at them? Its everywhere, and it`s not a safe habit to get use too. Matter in fact 1 out of 3 car wrecks are from people being on their cell phones not paying any attention to the road.

Cell phones have evolved over the years and I thinks that is what is so bad about them because they keep getting these better updates and things and people just feel the need to carry it or be on it where ever they go. Don't get me wrong, cell phones are a nice thing to have on you but you got to remember their not going to save you. They are they for you to use, you control yourself so you take the action and set the cell phone down whenever you get in the car to drive. Teenagers are addicted to cell phones like crazy, which is one of the top reasons injury's happens to young adults.
