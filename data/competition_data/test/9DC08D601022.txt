Dear Principle,

I have heard that you are planning to start a new policy in which you will need at least a "B" grade average in order to participate in sports and other activities, and I support this idea. I think this is a great way to make the students participating in sports understand that school comes first no matter what. Once you begin to play in a team or start something new all you begin to think about is that activity. It would be great to give these students a wake up call by kicking them off the team until they improve their grades. It is going to be like this in high school also, so it would be a good idea to get them ready. If the students really want to participate in the activities they would improve their grades. That will show they actually care but if they don't improve their grades then it shows they don't care and don't deserve to be on the team. You have to earn your spot in everything you do. Student are starting to think that just because they are good at something they are automatically going to make the team, they don't think that they have to prove they actually want it. It is a great time to start showing the consequences of not keeping up your grades. However their will be many arguing that this is unfair and that a "C" grade average is good enough to let you do activities but a "C" is an average grade and people participating in sports shouldn't be just average, they should be above average. This is my opinion on the matter and I hope you look into this and make the correct choice. This choice will start to affect the lives of students participating in other activities, so think carefully and whatever choice you make the school will support you.

Sincerely,
