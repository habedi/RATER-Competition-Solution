Dear Mr. Principal.

The students in our school are require to play sports which i think its a good idea. Students grades should be eligible for them to play sports .

However they have the opportunity to pull up there grades in there classes.

For example taking extra classes, staying for tutorial. Mr. principal i think you should give the students a chance to do activity .

Also up to the parents and teachers , and students to do what needs to be done. Some students will love to have an extra thing to do out of school and also in school as well.

What these teachers that's are coaches is that they have a lot of potential and success and they be who ever they i want to be . I feel and other students may feel why not have activity in school were students can enjoy for the hours they have in school .

If the students have outstanding grades thin yes they should play sports. Even if the students that making progress i feel that the principal should give them credit to as treating them with the same respect . Principal please give our students to succeed so they cam play sports.

Students would like to play sports to get an scholarship to go to college.
