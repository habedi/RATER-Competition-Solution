The "Face on mars" is just a natural landform. Because of the unusual shadow on the Martian mesa it made it seem like there was a Egyptian Pharaoh's face. When NASA unveilde the picture for everyone to see they specificly said in the caption that it was a huge rock formation that resembled a humans face, but because of the shadows it gave the illusion of a human face because of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Which is not really possible for the people to believe that Aliens had created this because of all the pictures that where taken there was no picture with a alien life form. Another reason for this is that you can see things in the digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. That way if there were other objects on Mars than you would be able to see that they were. Which makes this statement true that that it was a natural landform and shadows that had created this face.
