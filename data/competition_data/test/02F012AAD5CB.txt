Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom can be valuable. In the text it states "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becmoing confused or bored,' Dr, Huang predicts. 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."

Also it could help you know when your friend is feeling down so you could help them. So all in all you are getting a great classroom expercience.

"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor" So this could be the begging of a new era where everyone would be really happy to get back to class and learn because they never get tired of it. And we would get better grades and more interseting classroom studies.

Well lets draw out a classroom problem that the computer would know when to change your lesson. So lets say that your in math class (everyone pretty much doesnt like this class anyways) and you have just came up on a really diffullct problem, (like this hasnt happemed? Right?) and you get stuck. What would you do in this situtation? You would probably give up? Right? Well by know the laptop would have deticted that your getting really confused and mad , and by know would give you a new problem or help you out. Am i correct. Maybe, maybe not. I dont know. But people around the worl would probably want this computer by know because it would help a lot.

But there might be problems with this new toy, because not everyone shows there emotions the same. So how would you know what there feeling? That is a question that might have come up already and I know I probably want that answer. So how would they know what other people may be feeling? And will this product even be allowed in school?
