Driverless cars are a thing of the future.

They are said to hanndle conditions under a twenty five mile per hour speed.

Also they give the wheel to the driver to make sure that the driver can be in complete control over the situation.

Should driverless cars enter the development stage?

Driverless cars should not be in development for the follow reasons: malifunction error of the system or programming and not enough regulations for driverless cars.

Automakers have been battling with the lack of regulations for a long time.

Most automobile laws are focussed on keeping the passangers and others safe from harm.

But what laws are inforcing driverless cars?

Today, laws are in place under the assumption that there is a human driver always behind the wheel.

In fact, it has become illegal to test the driverless cars in California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.

The lawmakers would have to put new laws regulating driverless cars in case of an accident.

Automakers are still working on the self-driving car thinking that the problems will be solved ahead.

Will the government actually buy into the idea?

Driverless cars rely heavily on the technology built within them.

What if that was a problem? What if the technology within the car was to mallifunction?

Automakers rely heavily on the sensors arround the car.

The sensors arround the car are there to insure the safety of the passangers and others arround the car.

In the article, it didn't hint to the performance of these cars in extreme wheather.

If the system were to mallifunction would it give the driver complete controll and shut down the systems, or would it lose control causing an accident?

Humans have relied on technology for a long time, after a while the technology starts to decrease in performance.

What would be the cost to replace parts of the system of driverless cars?

There is also the problem of convincing others to buy the car if it starts to sell.

Would every American want to buy the car, or would they stick with driving the car themselve?

Humans driving cars are not a thing of the future.

In fact, the very first car to sell always had someone driving the car.

Human drivin cars have been arround for a long time and the introduction of self driving cars have been arround for roughly fifteen years.

Driveless cars should not start development for the following reasons: malifunction error of the system or programming and not enough regulations for driverless cars.

Until automakers insure one hundred percent liability, then develpoment of the cars will be taken into consideration.
