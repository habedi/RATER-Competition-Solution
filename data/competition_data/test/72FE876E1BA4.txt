Dear Senator,

The Electoral College has been around for many years now and chosen who would become president of our country. I believe that you should stop listening to the Electoral College on who will be the new president and start listening to the citizens of the United States. We are the ones who know what we want and who we feel will be a great leader for our country.

When citizens vote its known as the popular vote. Even though we vote every four years, its honestly a waste of time because the Electoral College doesnt care what we think. What matters to them is that they make the final decision on which president they think we care about more. Its not fair to us! We deserve a say in who we want to lead us in the right direction.

Back in the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana's legislature just about succeeded in changing the Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded, John F. Kennedy would have never became presedent even though the popular vote wanted him.

In Conclusion, I think its best to take away the Electoral College while we are voting for a president. The people have the right to choose who they feel will be the most honest and most loyal president to run our country. Thank you for taking the time to read this and hear what i believe should be done.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
