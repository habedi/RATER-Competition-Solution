I think driveless cars are kind of a issue but again i don't think it is becuase it would kinda be difficult or weird for a car to be driving by itself with you in you wouldnt be that used to it as if you were driving it your self. It would be difficult for me because im not used to it at all. I think it would be awkward to drive without steering or driving car yourself. What if you fall asleep while the car is going by itself it would be so weird because you will feel so awkward for it to be going by itself. It would be awesome because its somehting new in the world so everyone will want to test it out around the world. I bet most people are tired of driving by there selves anyway. I would most definetly try it out if it were to happen in Anderson, IN or somewhere near close by. I hope it does happen soon so i can get new car. Whoever get this car in the future please be safe becuase you never know what could happen in this world with a car like that.
