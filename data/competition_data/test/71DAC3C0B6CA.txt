Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe you should allow all of the students in our school, to use their cell phones during lunch other free times, during the school schedule. It would be extremely beneficial to us. For example there are many students in the school who break the rules break by using it during class, which distracts them from what the teacher is instructing the class or lecture they are trying to give. At the same time the student is risking the confiscation of their cell phone. If the new rule is implemented, students will put their cell phones away during class, because they will know as soon as the bell rings, they will have enough free time to text their friends or receive important calls. That way during class, the instructor has their full and undivided attention.

As I said early, students may have to receive urgent and important cell phone calls from their parents, regarding transportation issues and family emergencies. For example, if a student's mother is forced to work a double shift at her minimum wage job and needs to contact her son to tell him to ask, one of his class mates to give a ride or take the bus. He will receive the call, because according to school police, cell phones and all other electronic device should remain off during school. The child will stuck at school wondering, why his mother hasn't picked him up, after waiting long than usual.

For these reasons I believe cell from
