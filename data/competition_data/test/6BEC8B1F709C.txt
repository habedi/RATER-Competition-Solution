Driving is a way of getting around quicker and to get to places you need to go, ever since the first car was mass-produced it has cuased a social drift where now in this generation almost all people use a car to get anywhere. Driving is fun and is a helpful way, but imagine if you had to lower the amount of time you would spend in you car, it wouldnt be the end of the world the only negative effect of not using your car is taking more time to get there and excersising. A car releases fumes into the air which cuases air pollution, driving is one big reasons why we have global warming. According to researchers people in Car-Free communities feel less stress without their cars, becuase having a car is a responsibility;buying gas, not denting/scratching the car, and ofcourse keeping it clean. Driving is everywhere and has been here for awhile, driving has also sadly played a role in deaths across the nation, Driving under influence, foolishness, accidents and so on and so fourth. Maybe less driving isn't such a bad idea after all, there are already countrys that practice less car usage, even car-free days.

When you have a car its a whole new world and responsiblitys you will have and you'll have to maintain it, but driving is not the only way of getting around, there is running and bicicyles and walking which are all healthy options, maybe next time we you need to go to the local store you can take a bike or run there yourself and save gas and lessen air-pollution, ofcourse one trip without a car won't save the world but its a start. This generation is closely tied to using cars and most of them don't think that when they use a car the effects it has on using a car. Cars have been a great invention but now their starting to become a life-style. One of the common results of driving is traffic it is seen all over the place and takes up time and cuases stress among drivers, less driving would clear up the roads and lessen stress for others and be a/n open oppurtunity for others to get healthy.

Cars make up around 50% of greenhouse gas in the United States and cars are a nasty contributer to Global warming the fumes of the cars go in the air and get trapped there and hurt the ozone layer, also gasoline a source we find underground which we are using more and more than we get and it is a non-renewable resource, we break down mountains just to find this resource. Oil has cuased political disputes and the loss of forest,enviorments and more. When a car is destroyed it is sent to the scrapyard which is a big land just for destroyed cars and it takes up space, and it once could have been a nice forest. Car usage also is the producer of smog, sometimes smog is so bad in countrys they would have to ban car-usage for a number of days; that means we are abusing cars just a little too much.

Lastly, Car-Free is not new or scaring it actually is a rising trend countrys have done Car-Free day and the culture is spreading across the areas, being outside without a car using a bike or skateboard is a nice calm and relaxing way to spend a day and thousands of people seem to think so too, statistics say in the US the amount of cars being bought is slowly declining and driving less and the amount of licenses being optained is too. In some states there bike sharing programs and communities without cars. Car-Free communties are a great way to save enviorment, lessen air pollution and to connect the community together instead of passing by taking a walk and or taking a bike ride with someone you would want to be with, and instead of hearing the constant sound of a motor engine hear the sound of children at play. Lessening car-usage can save money, less stress, and make you view things in a different perspective or even Car-Pool so others don't have to use their cars. Cars were made to reach places quicker but why would you need to be in a hurry?
