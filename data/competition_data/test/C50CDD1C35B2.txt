I think that it's very important to help the community and I know some people think that to help the community takes too much time or they want to do something different.

But I think that everybody need to help and maybe it would be good to perform community service, so I think we should try to help more, and to do something that it's good for us and that help our school.

We should do more good things for our school. Maybe it's not fun but everybody need to help in something, we have to do more important things for our school ant to learn that it's good to help the community.

maybe it takes time away from what people need or want to do, but is not fair that some people perform community service and others don't perform community service cause we need to help too.

For example in the story that some SCHOOL_NAME elementary school children and others clean up litter, I think that it's good for the kids of the school to learn how to help the community because is very important.

So if some kids of others schools perform community service well

I think we should try and if that works it would be really good for our school.

But sometimes the students need to do other things and they can't perform community service well I think that the principal should ask them to know it they can.

My opinion is that the community is very important and we should do something good and to try to help more.
