In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating that Venus once had a ocean cover on it. Also that Venus once maybe had a kind of life form on it.

In the article it says that "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray" what that means is that we can build a blimp like vechicle to move ontop of Venus to gather rocks, or even dirt to take back and study. In the article it says that Venus and Mars are our sister planets. Venus also has a tempature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit which makes it really difficult to get to. but scientist think that Venus is worth the risks.

Venus being called the "Evening Star" is misleading because Venus is actually a planet. Its just really bright that even amature stargazers can spot it. Also scientists want to study Venus becuase its the cloest planet to Earths density, and size. And they want to know if it is abke to hold life on its surface again.

Venus is worth the pursuit because theyre so many benefits to finding out what Venus brings to us. Making Venus livable will make an huge stamp on the histoy of space science.
