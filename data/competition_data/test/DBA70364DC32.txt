Some schools require their students to complete a project created by their teacher over the summer. I believe that the projects should be student designed. 1, because the student can make the project based on what he or she struggled on the most through out the school year. 2, the student can add their own details and present it the way he or she wants.

First, the student shoukd make the project because, that students knows what they need to work on. the student would make the project denificial to them, help the do better. Nine times out of ten the teacher would make the same project for the entire class. And if that that student has Aced that subject, in what way is this project helping the student? No way.

Second, the student would be able to make the project look however he or she wanrts it to look. Add there own touch to it, and add specific detasils to their ptoject. Most of the time thye teacher would make the project simople and boring. Now a days kids like detail and actually care about their work

However, I understand why teachers like to be the ones to create their students project. As kids we tend to forget the point of view of the project and start writing about things that the teacher didnt even ask. Things that were not even on the check list. And there is a chance that if you let the student create their own project, they might end up not even doing the project.

In conclusion, yes it would be smarter to let the teacher create the project on their own(sometimes), but as time goes there are some really smart and intellegent kids and young adults out their that would love to make their own project. And their creation/version of the project; just might be better that the teachers.

THE END :)
