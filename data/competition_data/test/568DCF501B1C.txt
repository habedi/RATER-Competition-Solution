All humans face difficulties at all times in their life. Humans aren't always going to be happy every second of everyday. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author is expressing the new technology, the Facial Reaction Coding System. This is able to identify human emotions. I am against this technology on reading students emotional expressions. Students go through school and come across bad times and stressful times and not every student likes to show that.

Students go through emotions quite frequently and even when noticing one has a great big smile on their face, doesn't exactly mean they are happy. For an example, in paragraph 5, it states "For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." This shows that anyone can make any face just to show one is "happy" or "sad," others may not want people knowing how sad you actually are deep down. Everyone is different in their own ways, but for me being a student in high school and if i am ever sad, i show a smile on my face so not everyone is noticing my sadness and asking me what's wrong. Therefore, in paragraph 7,

"They even indicate the diiference between a genuine and a forced one." This is showing how the software and the movements in the mucles show the difference between an actual smile and a forced one. Not every student in highschool is going to know the difference on the movement in muscles unless they are studying it. There is a reasoning on why there isn't a bubble on top of our heads revealing our thoughts. One good example from paragraph 6 states "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too."

If one wants to express how they feel towards a family member, or friend, etc then thats on them for wanting people to know their business and talk about it with soemone else. Undertsanding the thought of understanding yourself, each and every individual has their own thoughts on things and many things that come across the head is always secured within yourself and never left your mouth which doesn't mean it needs to be notified by a computer either.

I strongly believe each student should be able to express their feelings how they want, if that means hiding their real emotions or embracing their real emotions. If one is upset and has something going on in their life, they know how they feel and don't need a computer operating all their thoughts. This is why i am against having this software of identifying human emotions.
