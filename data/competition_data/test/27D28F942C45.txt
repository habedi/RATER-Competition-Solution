Dear Principal,

I believe that students should be required to perform community service. Most students think that it is a waste of time and they would rather be doing something else such as shopping or going to the movies with friends. Community service would teach young people that they can make their community a better place by doing something as small as picking up trash on the side of the highway or helping the elderly cross the street. If all students did community service like helping homeless people, not only would they be changing someone's life but they would be learning to value what they have and not take it for granted. If students are required to perform community service then it could help many adolescents stay away from drugs and alcohol and do something that could affect many people. Even by going to and elderly home students can make someone's day a lot better. Other forms of community service such as tutoring can help people stay in school so they can go to a good college, and get a job to support themselves and their families. Also, it is required to do a certain amount of time of community service in order to graduate high school. Community service also looks good on applications for jobs and colleges.

Community service is easy and anyone can do it. Therefore, students can take some time out of their day to be selfless and help other people in their community.

Sincerely,
