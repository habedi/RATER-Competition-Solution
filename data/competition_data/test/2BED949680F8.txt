Luke had no idea that his life was about to change. He has two part time jobs at a bank and a grocery store. His friend Don had asked him if he wanted to go on a cattle boat to Europe because after World War II it left most cities in ruins. Luke had no choice but to say yes. So in August of 1945 Luke and Don went to New Orleans to take apart in helping families. After getting their papers from the seaman they went and borded the SS Charles W. Wooster, they headed for Greece with a cargo of 355 plus horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke ended up turning 18 before arriving at Greece. Luke realized that he could be drafted for military service but everyone just told him to what he's doing now as his military service. On his second trip he served as night watchman after doing his hourly report to the captian it was a rainy night and the ladders were slick and Luke slipped down the ladder on his backside and almost feel feet first out of the ship into the dark Dark Atlantic Ocean. But a small piece of metal caught and saved him. He was happy to be alive. But he couldn't do anything for a couple days because of some cracked ribs. Luke said it's more fun on the way back because when they drop off the animals the stalls are empty and they can play games like baseball, table tennis, and volleyball. They all say it's one thing that cuts time off the journey. Luke also made nine trips the most anyone has ever made. THat is why Luke likes being a Seagoing Cowboy.
