In the artical "The Callange of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it has, but that won't stop the will and dedication of people completing there dreams.

The author supports this idea by explaining what dangers there are to Venus and why it is worthy to go to Venus. As it states, "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmostphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet." This explains what the dangers are on Venus and why its hard to go there. As it is said, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This explains why it is worthy to go to Venus, because it was like the Earth once which make scientist want to go study what happened there to make it a dead-like planet.

People are always trying to find ways to go to different planets, but it will be a long while before we achieve our goals.
