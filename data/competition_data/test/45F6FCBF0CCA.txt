Dear Mr. Principle 2/15/11

I think that we shouldn't have to do community service as a requirement because kids are already busy enough as is. Kids are always busy doing homework, and extra curricular activities like football, basketball, baseball, golf, track, cross country, tennis, volleyball, soccer and any kind of sport can take up a lot of our time. But, there are also other things sewing club, choir, and play practice. so as you can see, we are very busy people. It could still be an option for some kids though. For students who aren't in any activities like that, there could be an offer of having community service be extra credit of some sort. That could also help students who struggling with some grades they could catch up just a little bit with a little extra credit and that could give them motivation to try a little harder in school.

Also, community service could be an extra curricular activity! There could be a group of kids who get together after school and go some where or volunteer some where and just give an hour or so of there time. I'm sure there would be a lot of kids who would want to participate in that! They would probably help a lot of people out as well.

Do I think that making it mandatory is a good idea though? No. I think that would make a lot of students just flat out angry and irritated. Especially if we had to do community service for a long time. But, I think if you did incorporate some of the ideas that I suggested it would be something for all the students to enjoy! So please take this into consideration.

Sincerely,

A Student
