Some schools are requiring students to complete summer assignments to assure that they learn over their break. A majority of the students like the idea but just can't get it done. Teachers often offer ideas as some sort of help. On the other hand, a good amount of students would rather do it themselves to make it more achievable. Students should do their projects without assistance so they can get it done on their own and feel more accomplished.

Students would mostly get an assignment done by themselves. They'd get it done their own way without someone telling them it would look better with this. Having someone telling how to get it done would just make it frustrating. They'd get it done better by themselves because they wouldn't have to listen to anybody else and it'd make them have to focus to get it done. Furthermore, it'd be in the summer.

Having assignments during the summer is also a good way to keep our brain focused about school. It'd remind us on what we had learned all school year. Furthermore, you could research all you'd need without being in a hurry. Designing the projects on your own would make also make it worth doing. It could even make you want to change your summer plans.

It'd be easier for a student to complete a summer project on their own. They'd be able to finish and design it however they'd desire. It might even turn out to be outstanding with all the time they had on their own. The completion of the project could make the student proud of what they've accomplished without assistance. It'd make them always have focus on what they've done. Doing something when you shouldn't have to keeps you busy and benefits you.
