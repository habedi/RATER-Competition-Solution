I think that policy number one would be the best policy for our school. I wold pick policy number one because i think that students should be able to have there cell phones during school but off during class. During lunch and break students should be allowed to use there cell phones so they can call there parents if they have to or have there parents contact them.

I think if students are using there phones during class they should be taken away until after school. But you should tell the teachers to watch carefully to see if any body is trying to use there phone during class. If the students get there cell phones taken away more than two times the principal should contact there parents and tell them that they have had there cell phone taken away two times. If they get there phones taken away a third time they should call there parents and the student should get a after school detention which is one hour long.
