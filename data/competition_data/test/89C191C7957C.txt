What if you didn't have to drag yourself out of bed and haul yourself to school every morning? What if you could still learn, but stay in a comfortable space? With distance learning, both of these are possible. Distance learning is a way of online or video conferencing to attend classes. This method of teaching is beneficial because it allows for people who are disabled to participate in class and it allows for less money to be spent on school construction; although it is said that online classes make people more anti-social, it actually makes people more safe.

Traditional schools and classrooms do not accommodate those who are disabled; but, if classes were online, everyone would be able to participate. Many students have disabilities that prevent them from being able to walk and speak to their peers. If these students were to attend traditional schools, they would have difficulty navigating narrow, crowded hallways. They would not be able to participate in class or express their opinions. If classes were conducted online, however, these students would be able to stay in the comfort of their homes and type their thoughts out to have a productive conversation with others. They would not have to worry about getting to class physically, and could remain in a comfortable space while still communicating and learning. In addition to those with physical disabilities, online classrooms also help those with mental health issues. Many teenagers have social anxiety, and entering a classroom with a lot of people can bring panic and discomfort. If schools were online however, these teens would not have to experience discomfort in classrooms. They would be able to talk more freely and learn better if they had more control over their surroundings and their communication style. Students benefit from attending classes at home because those with physical disabilities are able to participate in class, and those with mental health limitations would feel more comfortable.

Online classes decrease the amount of money spent on constructing physical schools, resulting in decreased taxes and increased public utilities that students can benefit from. The funding for school construction comes directly from the taxpayer. If schools were conducted online, the cost of construction of a school would be completely eliminated, resulting in less money paid in taxes. This increase in net income for families could allow for students to have better access to resources such as test preparation and online subscriptions to textbooks. As families spend less money on the construction of the school, they are able to spend more on the education itself. In addition to more money dedicated solely to education, online classes also allow for better public amenities. Instead of reserving space for a physical school, state governments can instead construct utilities, such as libraries or gyms. This would give students more resources to use; in the long run, online schools could be a more effective use of space, resulting in more available resources for other utilities. Online schools allow for more spending on education rather than construction, and allow for public amenities that students can benefit from.

It can be argued that online school will result in students not having face to face conversations, therefore creating anti-social students. But, the lack of physical confrontation can actually be beneficial. Although it is less common today, bullying still occurs in schools. Students cannot escape their bullies in person if they have classes with them every day. But, with online classes, students are able to control who can speak to them simply by blocking people who are harmful. For example, a student who is being bullied in all their classes is less likely to learn due to stress and worry about how they will be treated; if this student were to take classes online, they could simply block their bully and stop worrying as much. Online school does not make anti-social students; instead, it creates a better environment for students to effectively communicate in and allows for less bullying. When people feel safe, they are more likely to speak to others and collaborate. Without the constant teasing that often comes with bullying, students will feel more comfortable to discuss their ideas freely. Online school would result in less bullying and therefore would prompt students to have more participation.

Online schools are beneficial to students as they increase participation in class and increase the amount of money spent on education rather than construction; they make students less susceptible by bullying, making students more comfortable and allowing for the flow of discussions easily. Overall, the benefits of online school outweigh the potential drawbacks.
