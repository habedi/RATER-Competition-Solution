The author is saying that the journry to Venus, despite it being very dangerous, is very worthwhile in the long run. The reasons why are a myraid and the reasons why not are the same likewise.

A great reason for why the we should travel to Venus is that Venus is our sister planet and could have had an ocean at one point. From all we know most life starts from water and if Venus once had oceans on its surface that could vary well mean that it has had some form of life on it at one point. If this were true then it would be a tremonus discovery for it would be the first life found that does not come from Earth. The evidence for this claim of oceans once touching Venus's surface is that it has mountain, vallys, craters, deep tenches that Earth similarly has when it comes to it's oceans.

Sadly however, the trip to Venus would be very exspencive and very very dangerous. Venus has a constant wave of violent storms, is constantly having volcanic eruptions, it's clouds and air are acidic and it's air pressure on it's surface is incredibly stronger than even our deepest of oceas. Not to mention that is comes into around 800 degrees normally. The evidence for this are in paragraphs 2-3 when it states that many unmaned aircrafts have been sent and none have been retuned do to them being destroyed.

Another positive is that if a sucsseful trip to Venus was made then it would mark a major shift in space exsplraion along with giving us a lot more insite into Venus's history. If Venus was to be exsplored by us than we would be given a tremondous amount of knowledge of the planet and of better space exsploration.

NASA and scinentists have been trying to find a way to get to Venus and stay on Venus. They have propossed a few awnsers: one is that they create a station that would stay above the clouds. The air pressure and acid leavels are not as bad above the clouds and the tempeture is lower as well. The only problem is that we wouldn't be able to get much knowledge from above the clouds because the clouds are so thick we wouldn't be able to see past them. Another awner to the problem is to use older tech. Stated in paragrapgh seven: "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tent to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions." This means that new tech is less durable however older tech, which may not be as stylish, is incredibly durable, and could be the key to finally keeping a shuttle on Venus.

As the author suggests, studying Venus would help humanity tremondously despite the dangerous it presents; even though the planet is incredibly dangerous we would still benfit in learning about our sister planet.
