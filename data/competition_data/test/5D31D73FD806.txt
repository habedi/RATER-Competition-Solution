Cell phones play a huge part in today's society. They are used in our daily lives by letting us gain access to the internet, communicate around the world, and much more. They are life savers for many, but can it also cause tragedy? In many scenarios, these devices can put one in danger, especially while driving. Some may think otherwise but in capacity, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle.

See cell phones, in most cases, are distractions from reality. Many aren't focused nor are they aware of their surroundings. Being in that state of distraction can cause minor slip ups such as simple as tripping over a rock. Now imagine one being behind the wheel with this distraction. In this scenario, a person is in control of a fast-moving vehicle. Being distracted while operating a machinery that can put you and others at risk is nowhere near safe nor okay. People increase their chances in crashing even for just looking at a notification for a second. If someone is in a situation of being distracted because of their cell phone, there's a high risk of drifting off the road, hitting another car, or even an innocent pedestrian. It also puts their own life in danger as well as the fellow passengers.

Being distracted with a cellphone while operating a vehicle is comparable as being under the influence.

While being under the influence of any sort or alcohol or drug, people tend to not be aware that they are in a position where they can injure or even worse put innocent people in danger as well as themselves.

Distracted driving and drunk driving both have similarities but they also differ in one major thing, the decision. The person that has the choice of checking their phone also has the choice to not. They decide to either put their life in danger or make the smart, right decision to focus on the road. That small action of not checking your phone, whether or not you know it, saves you and as well as other pedestrians lives. The choice is up to them.

Many people think of it as futile information when being told that using a phone on the road can lead to fatal deaths or major accidents. These warnings should not be taken as a joke. Even if you confidently ponder that you can multi-task and that you'll be fine or it won't happen to you, the possibilities are endless. About 9 people die everyday due to having or being a distracted driver. Over 1,000 injuries are due to this.

Today, there are families grieving over loved ones that were lost due to these incidents. It just takes the person behind the wheel to realize that lives are put into their hands. So leave the phone alone and remember, better left unread than dead.
