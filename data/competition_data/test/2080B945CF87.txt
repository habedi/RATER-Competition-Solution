Some schools want students to continue their education outside of school so that the students will be prepared for the following school year and so that the teachers won't have to spend their class time reteaching a certain subject. But the summer projects that schools give to their students are more then likely made by teachers making those projects not fun and boring. Students should be the ones make the projects because they lose some of their summer do to working on the teacher's project. If the students were to make these summer projects they will be fun, not as time consuming, and not difficult.

Summer projects should be fun for the students so that they will actually learn and remember what the project was actually about over the summer break. So if a student make their own project they will try to make as fun as possible for themselves for their summer break and the project won't make their summer boring. If a student has a project in a science class the student could make a project about wildlife and the could keep track of all the different animals they seen over their summer. Another class that a student should make their own project in is history because the student could write down all the historical buildings and places that they seen over the summer break while traveling. The summer is a time for students to relax and stop worrying about school and homework but if a school decides to give out a summer projects the students should be allowed to make it as fun as they want it to be for themselves.

Next a summer project should not be extremely time consuming so the students will actually have time to enjoy their break from school. If teachers were to make a summer project it would take all summer but if a student was to make a project it wouldn't be very long. Most students will travel throughout their summer break so a long summer project will stop them from traveling as much as possible but if the project was shorter they could travel more and experience life to the fullest. If a English teacher was to make a summer project it may require a students to read 15 books over their break, but if a student make that project for English they could lower that amount to 4 book meaning the have more time to have more fun and not sit around reading all the time. The summer is about fun and not school work so if a school decides to make a summer project the student should be the one who decides how long it should take and not the teachers.

Finally a schools project should never be difficult because summer is supposed to a stress free time and the time for students to relax. If a project is too difficult a student will not want to do it at all and so they will not understand anything when they go over said project the following year, but if a student was to make the project it be easy so they will actually want to do it over their break and understand what may happen that following year. If a student is make their own project they will make it easy so that they will have no issue working on the project over the break and will get a good grade the following year on said project. If a math teacher was to give a summer project that makes students work out a big packet with a ton of questions in it a student will never finish it and they will receive a bad grade, but if a student was to make the packet it would shorter and a whole lot easier for themselves not requiring the student to struggle over their break. The more difficult a summer project is the student will never learn from it but if a student was to make their own it wouldn't be difficult and they would continue to learn over their summer break.

In conclusion a student should be allowed to make their own summer projects because teachers make everything more difficult then possibly needed. A summer project needs to be fun, easy, and short so a student can enjoy their summer to the fullest and still come back to school the next year ready to learn. So if a student make their summer project they will fufill the school by still learning and still having a great summer.
