No, we should not have diverless cars. One reason we should not have them because they are dangerous. Someone could die from a malfunction and they would loose their life because of the company. My next reason we should not have them because they cost too much. We are barley affording to pay teachers let alone have money to pay for reaserch and materials. My final reason is because they are just pointless. Without drivers that would put so many people out of a job.

My first reason is because they are dangerous. Anything can go wrong and end up killing innocent people. Technology has malfunctions everyday and sometimes we dont know why. No person or people should loose their lives because people are too lazy to drive their own vehicals.

My next reason is because they cost too much. Here in Richmond, Indiana we are barley affording to pay for schooling and teachers let alone driverless cars. Driverless cars should be the least of our worries at the moment. Instead of focusing on driverless cars, we should focus on how to lower the cost of an education. Education should be our number one priority.

My final reason is because they are pointless and would put many people out of a job. With driverless cars, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and many others would be out of a job. The passage says " Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?" That statement proves that many jobs will be lost because people are getting too lazy and too pre occupied to drive on their own.

In conlusion i do not think that driverless cars are a good idea. Our poverty rate will go up, and children and familys will starve. Where will we get the money to pay for the reaserch? We would have to take away even more jobs just to pay for the reaserch. We should not have driverless cars because they are dangerous, they cost too much, and they will put many poeple out of a job that they actually need.
