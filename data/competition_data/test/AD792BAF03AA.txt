Dear TEACHER_NAME

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing to you about the policy change you are going to make. There are many reasons on why you shouldn't change the policy but I am only going to name a few.

I know it is not good to have low grades but most of the students who have low grades love to play sports and without sports they feel they have nothing to do. Some students that are over weight and want to do something about it look to sports and if there average is a C then you are keeping them away from losing weight.

On the other side if a student with a C average wants to be in the Beta club or the Student Council then I say don't let them in because they do not deserve to be in it because they are leaders and leaders do not need to have low grades.

In conclusion I hope you make some of this out to be helpful.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
