When Generic_Name was diagnosed with with ChronsÂ disease she had no choice but to be admitted to the hospital while they figured out how to best treat her, she missed a whole month of school during that time. Although some may believe otherwise students should be able to attend classes from home because of chronic illnesses, other health issues, and some may learn better that way.

Some students may have chronic illnesses that require them to either be in the hospital or at home. Most people with chronic issues have good or bad days, when someone has a bad day they might not even be able to get out of bed let alone going to school. My neighbor was diagnosed with Chrons disease when she was in high school, she was in and out of the hospital for those 4 years. She missed so much school but had no way of being there because they did not have personal laptops . She missed out on so much school and had to transfer to Generic_School to be able to graduate on time. Some may believe that it is students responsibility to make it to class everyday without fail but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is not physically possible with most chronic illnesses. My cousin Generic_Name had Lyme disease her senior year of high school and missed 7 months of school due to complications with the disease and was unable to walk. She had to take her senior year over again because this technology was not available to her. It is impossible for people with chronic illnesses to make it to school everyday.

When there is a health crisis some student may not be able to make it to school. In a world such as today there are so many things going on, such as the Corona virus. Many students will not be able to come to class because of existing health problems that weaken their immune system. There is a student named Generic_Name who has severe asthma and has been hesitant to come to school because if she were to contract the Corona virus it would be detrimental to her health as her lungs are already compromised. Some may believe that students should still have to go to school because there is no real harm in getting the virus but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that if someone has a preexisting medical condition that weaken their immune system the Corona virus will take a massive toll on them and coming to school will defiantly not be feasible then. For example anyone that has died from the corona virus so far has had preexisting medical conditions that have only been made worse with the introduction of the virus.

Some students do not learn well in a classroom setting which in turn can make their grades plummet. Some student learn in different ways, some may be a visual learner and some may only learn things be doing it. When I was a freshman I was home schooled for the first part of the year but after failing all of my classes because there was no online work, it was only from a textbook, I went back to public school and excelled because most of the credits I was had to make up were online classes for English and history. I finished the online courses in a week when I had third and fourth quarter to finish them. Some may believe that students should be able to learn in any environment but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that not all students are the same. One of my siblings, Generic_Name, writes very colorful and neat notes because this is the way her mind will remember the information better. Another one of my siblings, Generic_Name, loves to read books, so if it is in a book she will remember it. Most students learn in different ways.

In the past people have not been mindful of how other people learn and what other people are affected by, but I hope that in the future people will be accepting of their differences and work with them to make sure they are working to the best of their ability without being discriminated against. Students should be able to attend classes from home because of chronic illnesses, other health concerns, and some may learn better this way.
