The main purpose of education is to provide students with opportunities and help prepare them for their future. Education creates the foundation for many peoples' career choice as well as valued personal connections. While at home schooling may be a helpful option for a select few students, having a student attend public school allows them to gain skills in social development and acquire learning and educational opportunities.

It is not realistic to say that someone could go through life completely solving all of their problems on their own. As humans, we tend to rely on those around us, sometimes even a little too much. Many people talk about the connections they made with other students in their classes as they went through schooling and how those people helped to shape them into who they have become today. Social connections allow students to find their own personalities, stay away from certain types of people, and see some of the different perspectives in our world. Also, students are more likely to obtain information when someone is telling it to them, or they are in a discussion about the topic, rather than reading it from a textbook or website. We are social creatures who learn from one another, and having face-to-face communication would only benefit our abilitiy to obtain and store educational content. When students are able to connect with their peers, they feel less lonely. This causes them to feel more comfortable in their learning environment and may allow them to take certain risks that will help their knowledge on any certain subject grow. We want our students to feel connected to not only what is being taught, but to the other peers and teachers as well.

When a child attends school they are engulfed in a learning environment. Within this environment is nothing but learning experiences and opportunity. When attedning school, students have access to certain materials, technology, and lessons that they could not acquire elsewhere. Providing them with hands-on sources of development provides a second level understanding of the content being presented. Secondly, while at school, students often participate in group work and projects. As stated before, connecting with other students will help present different perspectives. When education is able to explain and embrace these perspectives, students gain a deeper, more indepth understanding of what they are learning about. We want students to have a variety of skill sets and we want them to know how and when they should use these new skills. When education is not only understood by one individual but the whole group, the foundation of tomorrow's concepts are more likely to be comprehended and further developed.

While public schooling may seem like an opportunity booster if you will, it is not the best option for everybody. Some examples of conflicts that certain students face would be; medical conditions that prevent them from attending school, low income in their families, or behavioral conflcit that may prevent them from interacting with others. No matter how hard someone may try, they most likely will not be able to get through their life completely on their own. Our connections with those around us are what define us and what provide us with new purposes in life. We all must grow together. Therefore, we want our students to start interacting with other people as early as possible to build social skills that will help them later in life when dealing with conflicts. When students don't come to school becuase of conflict, all they are doing is avoiding that conflict and the issue never truly gets solved. However, online schooing may be the best option for students with medcal conditions so that they don't get too far behind and can still pariticipate as much as possible. Also, some students have to get jobs early in life because of finanical issues within their families. Online schooling can only provide them with an education to a certain extent. We want our students to have acess to the best and most beneficial education for their sake and for the hope of their future.

Our future generations and students who are currently in school, are going to be our workforce in the next decade. If we want our social and technological development to keep advancing the way it is, we must push students to connect in the classroom. Amazing careers are provided through outstanding education and each student has a right to these careers. Having students physically attend school provides them with social development, learning and educational opportunity, and connections that could last them a lifetime.
