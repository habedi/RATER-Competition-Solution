To the Principal:

Community service, to young people, is not always an idea of fun. Most kids and teens think of community service as a waste of time or no fun at all. This school should require community service because not only is it a learning experience, but a way to improve the community and one's self confidence.

Community service is beneficial to society. Simple tasks such as cleaning up the field, or picking up trash improve living conditions and make the environment more enjoyable to look at. I think students should be required to do some sort of community service because its not as hard as they may think, and if you put your mind to it you can get it done and move on to the things you want to do.

Community service can also help improve self-confidence. Doing good work for other people feels good. It feels good knowing that you just helped someone. Mowing a neighbors lawn or accompanying a grandparent on a walk around the park may not be what a student may call fun, but if done with a smile and determination, students will find that they are feeling better about themselves.

Overall, community service should be required because it can help contribute to a healthier environment and improve self confidence. Truly, it doesn't take much time out of the day to talk someone's dog for a walk, or mow the lawn. Today's generation needs to learn how to work and not just sit in front of the TV like a potato.

Sincerely,

Student
