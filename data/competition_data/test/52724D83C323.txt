Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have notice that you are trying to change the cell phone policy in school and I'm here to tell you that I think you should change it to your policy choice of number 1. With that being said I will give some reasons why I think you should change it to your policy choice number 1.

First off, the first reason why i think you should change it is that if you let the students have usage of their cell phone it will probably result to have the student respect the policy of not using it in class. Then when in class they will probably respect and turn off the cell phone.

Also, why you should change it is that what if they have a emergency and have to call home or need to call their parents. Some people don't like to use the office phone because maybe they need to talk about something private, they will not their information out for everyone to hear.

Last, maybe the students will feel more free and enjoy their transition time instead of rushing to get to class. And maybe they will enjoy the freedom of using their cell phones. Also they might enjoy coming to school.

All in All, I think you should change your cell phone policy to your policy choice of number 1. Trust me you wont regret it if you change it to policy number 1. You will get a lot of positive feedback for the students.
