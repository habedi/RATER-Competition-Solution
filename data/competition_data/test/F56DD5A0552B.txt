The human face itself can determine someones expressions within seconds upon looking on the person. You dont need no computer telling you whether if they feel happy or whatnot. It is a waste of time and money to buy the technology and put in time for basic things we should know as humans. The human face is easy to decode by your own self.

as in the article is says lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry by just a computer telling you these things but not off facts but off programs it was given to work. its programmed to tell whether you are feeling this or that its set off a data base of emotions all in one. the article even states theyre all just calculations and not fully correct theyre going off basic emotions.

therefore i see as in it not being valuable to profit in. you dont need all this to decode a persons face. you dont need a man made program just a for a computer to tell you what you already know. people arent just subjects to test on for emotions you gotta know this in life. take the hints, and gesture.
