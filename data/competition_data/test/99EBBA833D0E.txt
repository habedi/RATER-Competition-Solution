When I was young, I was born in a small town in Germany. Everything was nice and refreshing, but then I moved to the U.S and I felt uncomfortable. Everthing was big, lots of buildings, and so many cars with their gas polluting this world. I believe that there are lots of advantages of limiting car usages, like a better enviroment, a healthier lifestyle, and a closer walking distance.

Cars have runind many big areas with their smog, like Beijing, China, and Paris,

France.

"Diesel Fuel was blamed...,"

it said in the article,

Paris bans driving due to smog .

If we limited the usage of cars thing like smogs wouldn't happen. Trees won't get ruined from smog and animals wont die from pollution.

The less pollution we have, the more we get helthier. But its not just pollution,

"When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way..."

Having no cars and just walking to the palces you need to go or riding a bicycle is so much healthier than driving a car and polluting the world.

In the past two decades there have been efforts to make cities denser, which isn't bad.

That means everything would be walking disitance. there would be stores placed a walk away and not on distant highway. Kids can be safer crossing a walk way and not in danger.

Limitating car usage is not a bad think at all it's rather a very great idea, and way safer. Envioments become healthier, people will have a healthier lifestyle, and everything will become walking distance.
