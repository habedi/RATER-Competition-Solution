Summer projects are a fantastic idea for students to be able to learn over their break. Although having a teacher design these projects would be beneficial in making sure the students are learning the correct material, it would be more efficient if the students were allowed to design the projects themselves. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed as it well allow for students not only to enjoy what they are learning, but also allows them to use their own strengths to understand better.

Allowing a student to design their own project will change their attitude from if it was created by a teacher; furthermore, accomplishing it will make them feel even more proud. If the project was designed by the teacher, students will think that it will be boring, long before even seeing what the requirements are. Moreover, if the students were allowed to create their own project they would make it as enjoyable as they can, so they wouldn't have to dread working on it. By giving students the opportunity to create their own project, they will be more erratic to initiate it.

Also, students will be able to create a project that will allow them to use their strengths instead of their weaknesses when it comes to learning. Students have different strengths in ways of learning from one another; for example, some students learn better with visuals while others learn better from texts. By allowing students to design their own projects it will allow them to learn using their strengths, which can result in leading to an exposure of new ideas for the teacher to implement. Students being able to design their own project would help have a better understanding of the material that they are working on.

Student-designed projects will help boost a students morale toward the project and be able to have a better understanding of what they are learning. Student-designed projects will help focus on one student's understanding, rather than a teacher-designed project that focuses on every student's understanding. Summer projects are beneficial for learning, but would be more efficient if projects were created by the students.
