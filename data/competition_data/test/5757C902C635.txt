To whom it may concern,

Recently, I have been informed that students must have a grade B average. I believe that this a positive action for our schools. Doing so will give each and every individual student encouragement and leverage to do better with their academics. It is a shame that students have a grade C average, and something drastic has to be done.

When we represent our school, we would like to show others the best we can be which is not average. Putting this policy into action lets the students know that we will not settle for C's, nor should we. The student body needs a wake-up call, notifying them that in life you will not get the privileges you want if you cannot work to high standards.

This whole idea could change the school for the better. The words "what if" come around often, but what if our grade average for the entire school was a B? What if the students absorbed all of the information we gave them and used it to better our world? We are not asking for Einstein or a Lebron James for that matter; We are asking for better than average. Is that too much to bargain for?

If there has been no improvement, then maybe we can negotiate a better solution. We will not settle for anything lower than a grade B- average. Once you get it that low of expectations, students will just slack off and wait till you lower it to a C+ grade average. That is too close to a C average (the average they have now), if you ask me.

In conclusion, I presume that we are doing a fantastic action by allowing only students who have a grade B average or higher to participate in sports or after school activities. Keep up the good work!

Sincerely,
