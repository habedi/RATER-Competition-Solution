The Facial Coding System is a new computer that can recongize and calculate your emotions based on subtle facial movements. The software produced by Professor Huang and Professor Sebe works by constructing a 3-D model of a face and classifing it based on six basic emotions that humans typically express. The those emotions are then charaterised by movements of the facial muscles. In my opinion we should embrace new technology, but the question is, how will this change schools, marketing, and everyday life?

"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," according to Dr. Huang. He goes on to say that the software can modify the lesson, like an "effective human instructor. " Imagaine being able to adjust a lesson to the liking of the majority of students, being able to create insteresting and engaging topics for students and teachers to enjoy. Not only that, many students will experience depression or anxiety during their middle school or high school life, this computer can help consulors help those students more effectively. Overall, schools could see a massive change in students moods after introducing this software.

Shcools wouldn't be the only ones to take advatange of this new technonlogy, companys that are trying to market and sell their product could calculate what is liked and disliked based on the emotions analyised after people view their products. Some people would make the claim that it is an invasion of priviacy, but wouldn't we want companys to sell the things we like, rather than the things we don't? Imagaine always having excatly what you like or excatly what you need pop up in an ad, or suddenly become available at the nearest store. Not only do you get what you need, companys will be able to make more money, helping the economy grow, and hopfully that money makes its way back to you someday.

Aside from schools and marketing, how can this effect everyday life? The articles states that

"we humans perform the same impressive "calculation" everyday." we may not be able to tell the precentage of a person sadness or happiness, but we can determine when a friend is excited or bored. Imagaine being able to calculate your own happiness like weighing your self on a scale. Imagine that the software not only measures your happiness, but analyises what may be causing your stress and how to improve as a person. The world may truly becoming a better place.

The Facial Action Coding System seems far from becoming wildy accessiable to the public, but to me this new computer software will one day change our lives. From school, to companys, and our own personal life, this technonlogy can one day make life a little bit happier.
