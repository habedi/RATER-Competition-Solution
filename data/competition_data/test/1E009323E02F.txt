Since the development of the internet, online resources have been on the rise. These resources have helped make people's lives easier in many ways, including online schoolwork that is easier to access. Now, schools have been offering programs for students to take classes online or through video conferences and people are wondering whether or not it is beneficial. In many cases, students would benefit by having the option to work at home in case there were special circumstances that required them to be absent from school such as long trips, health issues, or mental health issues.

One way online classes would help students is by allowing them to take longer trips with their family or another community since they wouldn't need to be tethered to one location for learning. Many students travel during the school year for a number of reasons, such as family matters, religion, or even studying abroad. These trips can sometimes be extended over long periods of time. As a result, students tend to miss a lot of classwork from their time away and most students in this situation find it hard to catch back up. Having the ability to take their work with them would keep them from having to catch up and allow them to take as much time away from school as they need. In some cases, this luxury could backfire if students get too distracted by the traveling and their attention on their schoolwork starts to slip. But every student who takes long trips and thinks they would benefit from a program like this should get the opportunity to try it and if it doesn't work out, it can always be taken away.

Another reason online classes would benefit students is that it would provide a safer way for students with physical ailments to learn without posing a danger to themselves or others. Many children suffer from disease or distortment that would compromise the safety of a typical learning environment in a classroom. Because of this, those children typically don't get the opportunity to learn the skills and information that they need to survive in this world, giving the typical student a huge advantage. But with the online resources available, the children with disadvantages would have a much safer way of learning the same information as the rest of their peers without causing complications either by worsening their current physical condition, or by spreading a disease they may have to other students. It may be hard for some students with very serious health problems to take advantage of these opportunities and some might think that there is little point in trying, but the majority of these children want to live a normal life and learning in school is a big part of that. If they are not given that opportunity, they will always be at a disadvantage.

Similarly to students with physical health problems, students with mental health problems can also suffer from being put in a typical classroom setting and would greatly benefit from online resources that allow them to learn in a much safer environment. However, unlike students with physical ailments, students with mental health issues are mostly putting themselvesÂ in danger if they attempt learning in school. They might suffer from attention problems that the classroom setting does not help with or they might feel intimidated by other students and not be able to focus on learning but instead become unstable. This is where online classes would help because instead of having to deal with stresses that a classroom can cause, these students could learn in an environment tailored to correcting their disorders or at least not stimulate them. This would be a safer option for all parties involved since mentally unstable children when triggered the wrong way could potentially pose a danger to themselves or the people around them. While there are many students with mental health disorders that are perfectly fine learning attending school, the few who aren't would greatly benefit from online learning programs.

While some students might take too much liberty in pursuing online resources as an alternative to school and would hurt their academic career, the few who need it would benefit greatly from a new way of learning and would use these programs to help their academic career. The majority of school attending students that don't need an alternative would recognize that and stick to the classroom setting. As technology advances, advantages for the disadvantaged are becoming more and more common, and using the resources we create to help those who need help is becoming more and more important.
