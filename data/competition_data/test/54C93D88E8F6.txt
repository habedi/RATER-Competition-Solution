Dear principal

I think that our school should have cell phones in school. I believe that if we all had our cell phones everyone will listen to what you say. If you do this the teachers that are watching the students will be looking if they have them out in lunch or their free time. The other reason you had maybe wouldn't work and students will bring their phones to school secretly. If students don't fallow the policy and use them in classes then it will make it right to take the policy away. The second policy will make the teachers more alert and make the teacher teach slower. This will make them slower because they will be checking every time. I believe that if students have their cell phones at lunch that they won't be asking the principal as much. It says that they will have to turn off their phones in class but they do have lunch and their free periods. Witch is a good time to text or message their friends.
