Dear Principal,

I think that it is a bad idea because I don't have a B or A in every class. Some people are really good at certain sports and I don't think that everyone of them has a B average. At my school, some people are on the volleyball team or the basketball team and I don't think they have a B average either. Some of the sports people really love and I don't think they are really good at the classes they have but they are amazing at the sport they really like. So I think you might want to think again about this whole idea. Lets just say, what if you had a sport you really love and they say you can't join because your a teacher or principal. That's the way some of us feel, we can't do what we want or love because there are certain limits. So please rethink this idea and you will see what happy children we are when you do.

Sincerely, a certain caring student =D
