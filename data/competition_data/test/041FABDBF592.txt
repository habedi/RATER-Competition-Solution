Dear Principal,

There are a lot of kids in this school that like to play sports. They want to be basketball , football, and even baseball players. With out sports in school kids are just going to not caring about school and some might even drop out because some kids try to impress girls with there ability to play sports. Many of us kids think that it is unfair to only let kids with a "B" average to play. I think you should let us play with a c average because we are probably one of the few schools that like sports and have higher then a failing grade.

I have heard that some kids will try to pick up there grade just to be on the basketball team or football team. I know that kids need sports, some to let out there feeling, some to let there energy out. you need to have sport because some kids like to stay fit and have a six pack. some kids might not like any kinds of sport and might like to have like a rocket ship building class or like a baking class. Some kid are just interested in making beats or drawing. I know a lot of kids that like to stay fit just to impress the women how they look. Maybe you can make clubs like 4H or FFA.

I under stand that it will cost money but i can tell you that you will not regret having sports or other activities.

you never know if your school will have a hall of fame or its own trophy room.
