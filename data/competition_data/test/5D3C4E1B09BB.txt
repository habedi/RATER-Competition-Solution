Dear Principal of our school,

I should inform you that performing community service is a very wonderful thing to do for our community.

A good example is picking up litter that careless people throw on the ground.

Another good example is helping the elderly or helping your next door neighbor shovel the snow.

These are really good things that the youth can do for older citizens.

My response o you is mainly about encouraging you to make students perform community service for others whether they like it or not.

First of all, performing community service doesn't really take a lot of time out of your hand.

It probably only takes about an hour or so to make a huge difference for others.

I used to help at my public library such as ordering the books or placing things in the right order. It wasn't really a big deal at all.

It took some time out of my week.

I did service there for about an hour a day. Community service isn't really a huge waste of time.

Furthermore, community isn't only about helping others.

It is also a learning experience.

While kids are wasting their time hanging out, playing video games, or watching television, they can do this to learn responsibility. Many parents have kids that are irresponsible.

This will help them.

This can really help them when they get older.

When they become adults they will realize that there isn't time to fool around.

Thirdly, this experience will finally let kids get the chance to help adults.

The youth usually fools around while they don't realize that they can make a big impact towards other peoples lives.

Helping the elderly will make them very thankful for showing that you care and that they can't really do many things without assistance, such as mowing the lawn.

In conclusion, community service will finally give the chance for young people to help the environment and the people that live in it. This is very helpful, since many people don't take the time out of their lives to at least make a difference.

Hopefully, this will convince you for the students of our great public school to do community service.
