There are many things that you can do in the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Going to different places on your trip. Playing games that you never have done before. Also helping different countries.

There's always a reason to do the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Sight seeing is one of the reasons. You get to go see different places and wonder around new countries. You might get to see Venice, Italy the city of water. The Panama Canal in China. Might see the Acroplis in Greece.

Helping others is another activity that we do for the progam. Helping rebuild countries after a terrible event. Taking care of animals. Delievering animals to different cities or towns.

When your on the ship you get to play games. Playing baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals lived before. Having tournaments for table-tennis. Reading books or doing other games to pass the time.

There are some many reasons why you should participate. If I were you, I would want to be in the program. Playing games, seeing other places. You wouldn't know of what your missing.
