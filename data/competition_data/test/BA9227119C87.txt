Should people be able to use phones while driving?

Cell phones should not be allowed while driving. Using a phone while driving should not be allowed because they cause car accidents, deaths, and insurance to rise. Studies show that a cell phone can put drivers at a greater risk of a car accident. Even though it still is dangerous, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. People think that it is safe to drive hands free, looking down because they can drive without them. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

People who have jobs that depend on phones say that they always have to be available to answer the phone even while they are driving. Because of these habits they can create a dangerous environment for them ad people around them and can cause collisions. Business related jobs can also be stressful ad cause emotional stress that can lead to a bad tragedy. The conversation can possibly cause the person to be upset and can lower their driving ability, which can lead them to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

People driving hands free is also another thing that can be dangerous because they think that they are very skilled drivers who know what they are doing. There are devices that people can be safe, but that is not always the case. Hands-free devices do not take away the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. According to some studies, they show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. That means that people can possibly miss a stop sign, hear a horn or siren, not paying attention to traffic lights, and looking out for their surroundings. This is a huge problems because more and more people can die or be extremely injured from this because some drivers make very poor decisions.

People say that phones can be useful in emergency situations. While that can be true, there are also some cons behind it. If a person were to get into an accident, they would have trouble finding their phone because they cannot reach it or it is nowhere to be found. People should not rely on their phones especially when it comes to emergency situations. It's not going to always help to use a phone when it is out of sight to where you cannot see it. There are services that people can use to get help through these kinds of situations. In case there is an emergency, you can have the service contacted through a device that is equipped to your car knowing your exact location. This will better your situation more than using your phone.

If people do not change their ways on driving with phones, more and more accidents will happen overtime. Phones are never that important to be on while driving because you can always call or text that person back when you are done driving. There should not be any more accidental deaths of pedestrians or children that want to cross the street and get hit by a person making poor decisions. Any person who is caught texting ad driving should be fined for people their life and others in danger. The world needs to be very aware of this serious situation and make a change.
