Dear principle,

I think that we should keep it at a C average because Some people that play sports stay at the average to play, and if you made it a B average then they would have to go to practice and go home and study and not have enough time to study. Then when they take the test they had to study for they wouldn't do so great on it them there average would go down.

Then they wouldn't have a lot of people to play sports. Sports keep us active and in shape. It keeps us healthy if, students couldn't play sports then kids wouldn't be so healthy we would all be fat, and im sure we don't want America like that. I think a lot of people struggle to make B averages. A lot of people cant learn quicker than other. Some people need time to go home and study not stay up all night have a test fail it. Not be able to play or be lazy for the game.

I would love for them to keep at a C average. C' s aren't that hard to make if you try, but if you don't have a lot of time to study then there isn't much possible chances to make a B average. Not a lot of people make B' s and A' s. I would hate for you to make it a C average. I wouldn't like it at all. Then they wouldn't pay to play a school sport, then the schools would have any money from they parents paying.

Sports are for fun, and competitive. Something active to do. Something that make a person happy. I'm sure you wouldn't want to take that away. Im sure a lot of parents wouldn't be so happy for there child about this. The kid would be pressured to do better, then they would be able to do the sport, then they would get so caught up in it they would fail at keeping there grade up then they wouldn't get to play there hobbies.

The sport they play could be something they want to be when they get older. They need lots of practice when they are younger to be a good player. This sport they play could be there carrier. Then they wouldn't have much of a chance to make it in a good collage they want to get in for there sport.

I would love for you to keep it at a C average thanks.
