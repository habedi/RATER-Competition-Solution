No phones

Teachers and principals should not allow phones in any part of the school area because it would make things worse.

Classes would then have a lot of noise going on everywhere and it would really bother people in the hallways. You would not be able to talk to your friends. They would always be on there phones leaving you left behind.

My next reason is how there is so much noise always going on in the lunchroom that you wouldn't have time to call anybody. There wouldn't be enough time to eat anything if people kept calling you. Nobody likes it if someone bothered you in a good conversation. My theory is that would phones do that exactly.

If they allowed phones for teachers then it would be horrible. Student would never get anything done in class and miserably fail there classes.

Like I said teachers and principals should never should never allow phones in school. It would only bring chaos.
