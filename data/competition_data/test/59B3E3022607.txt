Luke wants to convince you to become a seagoing cowboy. I am here to tell you that no one has to listen to him but im going to write an argument about luke trying to convince you.

So luke is trying to tell you to become a seagoing cowboy but luke qutoes that he had experenced being a cowboy but some of you might not of had that experince like he did so when your working you might get hurt really bad. Also if you are sea sick which means that you really cant go on trips like luke does because you might get sick. Luke tries to convince you by telling all these great things you would see but the captian might have you a different job on then you will be missing out plus i would rather go with my family how about you?

In this paragraph ill be talking about the dangers of becomeing a seagoing cowboy. In this story luke claims that he got hurt on night watch. On night watch you might get hurt because it was to dark out and the the floor was slppery and you fall and get hurt. Another danger is crashing say everyone is sleeping in their cabins and your boat gets drifted and crashes right into a iceberg. There is also another possibility is that your boat gets drifted into the middle of nowwhere and no one knows where there at so you just get stranded at sea. Another possibility is that if your crew is on a long long journey you might run out of food for the the humans and the animals which will lead to starvation and some humans might die but most of the animals probably will die.
