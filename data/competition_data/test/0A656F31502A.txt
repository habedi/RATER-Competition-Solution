Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger on been the hotest planet in our solar system. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, Venus has a thick atmosphere and even their clouds are of highly corrosive silfuric acid in Venus's. NASA studies Venus just to see, what a other planet have in commun with the Earth.

NASA hve been looking for another project as the old technology called mechanical computers. They want to use this mechanical computers because it makes calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Also, they having think abut the Modern computers because they are enormously powerful, flexuble and quick, but the tend to be more dicate when it comes to extrem physical conditions.

Venus has really hick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets, Nasa knows this because they tried the most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

The Ntional Aeronautics and Space Administration( NASA) has one particulary compellin idea by sending humans to study Venus and set their life on risk. As the humans that MASA idea tried to sent them to study Venus will not kill them because Solar power would be plentiful, and radiarion would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

Many researchers are working on innovations that allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. The study challenge that the NASA realized presented That Venus has VAlue, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
