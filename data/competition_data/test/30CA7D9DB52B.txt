There are many differant reasons to limit car usage, the most well-known reason being that it will greatly reduce air pollution. Several places incuding Vauban Germany, Paris, Bogota Colombia, and the United States have proven this, especially Paris. Paris at one point in 2014, had to enforce a partial driving ban purely because of the hazzardous smog caused by air pollution. In doing so Paris relatively quickly cleared the majority of the smog, and realized how this can also help to reduce road congestion. The United States are another, larger example of how much limiting car use can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Another good reason for limiting car usage would be that it will generally reduce stress in people. Limiting or lowering the usage of automobiles anywhere can help reduce stress mainly because people won't have to worry as much about traffic, maintanence & repair costs, air polution, or even the general dangers of driving a vehicle. Almost everyone knows that less stress is a good thing because of how it helps your health, therfore, limiting how much you drive is will not only improve your health by reduceing how stressed you are, but it will also help you to be healthier because it reduces the overall polution in the air.

So in the end limiting automobile/car usage will be advantagous for the earth, and every country or nation on it because of how it reduces stress, promotes health, and reduces greenhouse emmisions around the world.
