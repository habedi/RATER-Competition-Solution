The author brings up many great ideas and facts about venus. In paragraph four the author says that venus and earth have a lot of the same physical features. The author brings up at one time venus could of had oceans. I think this is a false statement because the average tempature is 800 degrees. So I think all the water would evaporate over time. The author did bring up in pargraph four how venus had a lot of similar features like mountains,valleys and craters.

I dont think we should travel to venus my reasoning for that is in paragraph three the author states that the pressure is 90 times greater than earths and could crush metals. I dont belive we should travel to other planets because im afraid of what we may find. I defintly belive we should study planets in our solar system we need to be aware of whats around us and try to figure out if there are other life forms.

In conclussion I think we should futher our investigation on the planet Venus. We as a country should not try to go there if the atmosphere will crush a submarine I cant imagine how our human bodies would react.
