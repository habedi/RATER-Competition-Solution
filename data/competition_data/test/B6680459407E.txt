I think that that the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of people is valuable. I think this because sometimes its important to know someones emotion, and if they are faking or lying. This technolgy could be helpful for people to indicate wheather they need help or not. I also think that tis technology could help save lives too. I'll explain why.

First reason on why this technology is valuble is because it can be used in the classroom to know wheather a student is confused on the lesson or not. A shy student sometimes wouldnt want to ask for help about the lesson. So using this technology for would be very useful because teachers would now know who and who needs help. It could also help teacher to know if a student is angry, sad, etc to know how to help them. That one reason why I think this techonolgy is useful.

Another reason why emotion reading technology is useful because in paragraph 8 the article stated " to an expert, faces dont lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politcian or celebrity isnt being truthful". This means now we could know if a leader is being real or not. It could help with votes during an election to choose the correct politician. Not only that but in genral to knoe if people are lying or not.

last reason why I think the use of this technology is valuable is because it can save peoples lives. using this technolgy would let you know how a person is feeling. If a person is depressed and on the edge of doing something that they shouldnt , using this emtion reading technology could alert people on how others can be feeling very down and thode people could help them. It could also help parents knowing wheather their child is happy or not and I think a parent should know their childrens emotion because half the time we dont express our selves to our parents. So thats why I think using technology that can indicate your emtion is valuable.
