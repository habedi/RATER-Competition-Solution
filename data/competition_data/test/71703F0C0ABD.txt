Students should design their own summer projects because they can make the project about things they learned over the summer or while they were in school. Having to the project in their own way should make it more better for the students to learn more on how to make a project, come up with ideas about the project, and get the feel on how to do things on their own without a teachers assistants. Having a project to do on you own makes things go easier for you without a teacher way of how they want the project to be. Although if a teacher designs the summer project for the students it will save the trouble of a student having to think of what their project should be about and the students will not just make the project on anything they shouldn't make it about.

Firstly, if the students design the project of their decisions they will feel more comfortable working on something they designed without a teachers opinion and they can do it at their own paste instead of having a teacher telling them when its due. And when students design the projects by them selves they get a chance to teach themselves more and learn more from their mistakes so when next time they have a project to do they will have it down packed. Also the students can take summer school where they can have access to book to help they with there summer project and computers where they can get resources to look up information about the project their designing. But students should take the project serious so they can understand how to make projects on their own so if a time comes when they to do it again without any assistants it will be more be better the next time.

Secondly, if the students design the summer project it will be more fun if they deign it because there friends can all help and work together to make the project fun and they can challenge each other to see who can make the best project and but also in a correct way. The project can also be fun because the project can be about things they like such as a favorite sport, favorite food, or even favorite place to go doing this should make the students more interested in doing the project on there own without a teacher. If the students can make the summer project more fun by making the the project about things they wanna or like doing it will push the the students to make to project strong and more topic related so that the students wont get off topic. Another way the students could make the project more fun is making it more about them so they can be relax and want to the project .

Thirdly, it helps the students practice more on projects if they design it their selves by doing this it teaches the students how to handle situation like this throughout life and they can over come that if they dont use help for a teacher or anyone. Also if they keep practicing how to make projects on their own they can help others in need of help making and thinking of ideas of how to make their project this is why know how to make project on your own helps out a lot. Making projects teaches you a lot about yourself you find out what you need help on and what your good at designing a project can be a lot of work but you can do it if you practice a lot if your doing them yourself. Practicing how to design project can be really helpful to you in so many ways and knowing how to make projects can help when your in school and needing to do a class project with other students that doesnt know how to make their own project.

In summary, students designing their own projects will better them if they have to make another project on there own rather in school, work, or even summer projects. Without a teacher designing the project for the students they can get ideas of how to do it there selves in need of a time to make projects by them self. Also if teachers design a project for students the students might not like the summer project the teacher assigned for them to do and they wont do the project in that case they wont learn anything. Therfore students should be allowed to design their own projects without a teacher idea of how it should be designed and they can make it how they want to without the teachers opinion and they will want to do it.
