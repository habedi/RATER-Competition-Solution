Dear Principal,

Greetings, I have read your response and I can see why you are considering this policy awareness. I think that Policy 2 will be the most reasonable and the most effective for the students for their own benefit. The reason I think that this is the policy that should be taken action is because it'll will keep students focused on their studies, it will cause them to do other things besides using their phones, and it will keep them from damaging their brains from texting and staring at a screen all the time.

First, using phones distracts students from their studies and keep them from succeeding in schoolwork and other educational necessities. It makes them all worried about who their texting, the drama, and plans, or other unnecessary things to talk about when in school. It will cause them to fail in their school work and then not pass in their classes. It will cause them to lack behind in their work and also cause them to function poorly. Instead of going home and doing homework, they'll be on their phone chatting away because they have no idea what's going on in school.

Next, when not having a phone or any other distractions, a person can learn and explore more things. In their free time, instead of talking on the phone or texting others, they can have a study group Then maybe read books, or join fun activities in the school campus, or just hang with friends. They can do all of that phone business at home or in their other free time. School is highly important and it plays a huge part in a student's life and it has a big effect on their future.

Furthermore, it will keep the brain from damaging itself form all the staring onto a phone and texting. When to much pressure in talking on doing nothing but staring into a phone and always being on it, can hurt a person.

The brain should be healthy and have an open mind. It can hurt a person from just being all caught up in the drama about which a person is constantly texting, chatting or talking on the phone about all the time. A hobby or some sort of activity in a person's life should take place instead of a phone being a whole person's life story. This can damage the thinking of a brain development.

To conclude, schools should have phones taken away during their house because a students academics is one of the biggest achievements in life and education is very important. Instead of having a phone and person can have other hobbies and experience more things to get ahead in life and prosper. Using phone during class and twenty-four hours of the day is really damaging to the brain. A brain needs to stay healthy and be very open minded. Using phones, texting, chatting, talking, and just this constant entertainment is too much for a student in school. It doesn't bring any goodness to a child's academics and looses focus. This action must be taken. Otherwise if no one reacts we could have a very bad situation in the later years when not many people have taking their education as some thing very serious. Overall I think that taking away cell phones in school would be the best for the students for their own benefit.

Sincerely,
