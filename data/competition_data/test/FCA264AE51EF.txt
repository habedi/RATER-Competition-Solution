Summer projects are often used as a way to ensure continued enrichment of American students during break because they have a longer time off. There is the debate however, should the projects be designed by students or by teachers? Students should design the projects because it allows for creativity, is a chance for personal exploration, and the fact that the student is on break would be respected.

School, unfortunately, is the place where creativity goes to die. Students have to adhere to a set schedule, with few deviations and personal choices, where the teacher decides how everything happens. This paired with the fact that schools in America often have the teachers organize their class around a standardized test makes it almost impossible for true creative, educational exploration. A summer project designed by each students would be the perfect way for new ideas to be created and tested. Bringing in and encouraging creativity in the youth is an extremely important part of ensuring that society will be run by people who think outside of the box, who bring new perspectives in. Also, being creative has proved to be good for maintaining mental health. Many times in therapy creativity is used as a way for the patient to be calm and work their problems out in a positive and constructive way. For example, art therapy, which is all about using artistic ways to work through important issues. This is also why, in recent years, adult coloring books have become popular. They allow a person to be creative even if they're not artistically inclined. Considering that many American children, highschoolers especially, struggle with mental health issues, giving them a chance to be creative could prove to be very beneficial for alleviating some of those problems.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it gives them a chance for personal exploration. Youth is all about changing, figuring out who you are, and becoming something new, but in stricter societies this desire to explore is squashed by social structures that rely on conformity. Allowing the students to study something they're passionate about is an excellent way to give kids the chance to develop as fully as possible. School doesn't make for good personal exploration, in fact it's the exact opposite. Students are rarely recognized as individuals, they're referred to as a whole, as if they're part of a hive mind. The rules are all made as blanket statements, one persons mistake is now every bodies. Which, this cannot be held against the school, it is efficient to do things this way, but from a students perspective, it can truly weigh down on them. Years and years of feeling like nothing more than a herd of sheep is discouraging, and that is the reason why many talented individuals slip through the cracks. Think of people who are known for their innovation and strong talents like Bill Gates, Basquiat, etc. Now consider their schooling. Most didn't really flourish in school but rather later on, when they had graduated or dropped out, were their talents really appreciated. So, student run summer projects are one of the best ways to have students explore their interests and talents, while still maintaining the "this is a grade" aspect that would curb the lazy tendency to give up on ideas.

The final reason summer project should be student run is that break should be respected for what it is, a time to relax and re cooperate. If a teacher was to set up the project, it would be tedious work because the teacher rarely has a true personal investment and interest in the project they're assigning. There would be unnecessary essay parts and it would be on a topic like local civil war history, something that few children are wanting to spend their summer thinking about. Speaking from personal experience, when a project design is left up to the student, it feels much less like a chore and more like something that they want to do. If kids pick their projects it could make learning something that is looked forward to, not avoided. It wouldn't be fair to students to take what they have always known to be as their time, and dampen it with something that looms over their head, that puts a damper on the whole breaks.

Summer projects are an amazing way to make sure that the three month break isn't put to waste, but they are only truly a positive thing if the student is able to design them. Students designing their own projects would allow for creativity, exploration of themselves, and still respect the time they have off. Yes, it can be said that kids today need to "suck it up" or some other entitled phrase that stomps on their opinions, but just like adults, kids deserve to enjoy their free time, even if their regular time isn't taken up by hard adult troubles. Why force students to grow up earlier than necessary? Why not let them enjoy this easier life without a grownup throwing another boring responsibility at them? Children have little say in their lives, they should be at least able to choose how they spend their free time.
