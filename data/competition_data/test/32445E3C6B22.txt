There is no way that student-desigend summer projects are better than teacher-designed projects. Not only do teacher-designed summer projects end up preparing students for college but it could also end up changing students apprecitian about a subject as well as help them on classes that require two or more years. If more school wants to help students learn, retain knowledge, and be more prepared for the future then they ought to make summer projects be teacher-designed instead of student-designed.

If summer projects were to be teacher-designed, then students could end up changin their opinion about a subject and/or class. Two years ago, I had to do two summer projects that were for different classes but one was cleary a teacher-desgned while the other was clearly a student-designed one and once I completed both projects, the one that was teacher-designed got me to learn far more about the subject that it in turn reverted my appreciation of the subject from being just an ok subject, to one that I am deeply passionate about and would gladly go on a full on lecture while the other project just kept my stance on the subject the same way it was.

If summer projects were to be teacher-designed, then the project would end up helping students next year if the class is one that requires more than one year since teachers knows more of what to expect next year. Once, my friend decided to do a teacher-designed summer project on a class, which requires two-years, and once he completed the project it signifcally helped him the following year since he knew what to expect for the class as well as it prepared him for the kind of work he would have to do that year thanks to the fact that the teacher who deisgned it was his teacher for both years. Comparetively, another friend of mine, which didn't do that project, ended up struggling the entire year, though he didn't get a bad grade he ended struggling and being more stressed compared to my other friend who did the project.

If summer projects were to be teacher-designed, then students would be more prepared for the kinds of school work that they would have to do in college. A couple of years ago, my older half-brother had to do a summer project for a class, that he didn't quite do well in through out the school year but once he completed the project, even though it was challenging for him, and took that same class in colllege he was very grateful that he did the project since not only did it helped him prepare for the challenging work that he had to do in college, it also helped him to be more knowledgeable about that class and he ended not struggling nearly as much as he did all those years ago. He was so grateful that he actually sent a than you letter back to his teacher he assigned him the project.

Now some may say that the one advantage that student-designed projects have over teacher-designed projects is that they are less stressful, and though that may be true when you're actually doing the project, in the long run it can cause more stress because it barely exposes students to any challenges and thus doesn't prepare them for the challenging work that they will have to face later in life. So, no matter what way youl look at it, teacher-designed summer projects are far superior than student-designed ones. Hopefully in the future more and more school will push to ensure that students take teacher-designed summer projects since they actually benefit students compared to the alternative.
