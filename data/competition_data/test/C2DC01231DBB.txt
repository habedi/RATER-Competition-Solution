Limit Of Car Usage

When you think about limiting car usage you might think "Well how am I supposed to get there. Theres no way i'm able to get to my destination without a car." Yes, I'm pretty sure we all would'nt want to walk five thousand miles to visit a friend three hours away, but here me out. Doesnt a car make you all tired? Knowing you have to pay a bill every month, or getting gas four times a week. Just imagine a world where thats not a problem.

In Vauban Germany they are most of the time a car free zone. Owners of cars aren't allowed to have cars in there garage or in the streets or wherever a car would normally be. They have to keep there cars in a space they buy at the edge of the community for $40,000 plus the paying for their homes. Now I wouldnt want to pay all this money to park my car. Most people in suburban homes sold their vehicles so that they could live there without a problem. Heidren Walter said," When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." She says as she's walking down the street she can actual listen to the communtity of children playing and not be drown out from the loud motor in the car.

Now, limiting car usage doesnt mean we all have to walk to our destinations. We could start using bicycles more often and actually get a benifit of working out. Sure it might make you all sweaty and gross. But make a plan to get up a little earlier and then wash up at wherever it is you are to be. And limiting cars doesnt mean every single one of us need to give up our cars. Instead we can find a friend who lives near to us or a fellow co-worker and car pool. Instead of all two hundred employes lugging their cars on the road and getting stuck in torturous traffic. make a plan to get five people in a car and instead of two hundred cars on their way to work, there would only be about fourty cars going to the same place. That would clear up our roads and ruduce traffic. In France Congestion was down sixty percent after reducing cars.

"Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Westurn Europe.." ,according to Robert Duffer. People today are now worrying to much on their cars and how much it will cost them. Not worrying about jobs and insurance. The invention of the car was not to see who can get the most miles or whos car gets better horse power. It was about helping people get from A to B, and we can do just that.

There are many people out here who will think that limiting car use is a waste of time and like to keep things the same. But we can be the generation who changes that. If we could go down to one car a family and start car pooling with one another, or even start using bikes to go to places with our friends, we can help make the community a better place. One day just try. Try walking to the super market. Instead of making your mom drive you and your friends to the mall, try making a plan to all ride your bikes there. It doesnt hurt to try, so try to start.
