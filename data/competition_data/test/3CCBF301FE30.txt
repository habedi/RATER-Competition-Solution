Dear Principle,

RINNNGG!! Many people consider cell phones to be a distraction in school, and so they make rules against them in school. Cell phones aren't a distraction as long as they are on silent or not in use during school time. Students should have the opportunity to use cell phones during their lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. There is no problem with this because it will not disturb anybody from their education and still let them enjoy their school day a little more. There is noting wrong with providing students with some fun on their boring and school days. This will make the students enjoy school a little more, and they will be more eager to learn after they had their day of fun.

Cell phones should have a chance to be used during free times. Students usually are not eager to learn because they are bored, or they are tired of all the studying they did so far. Cell phones will bring a little fun into the students' school day, and so they wouldn't mind learning after having a little fun at lunch or their other free times. It will benefit the school by letting them educate their children better and make their students receive a higher grade than usual. Using cell phones during their free time will increase their grade. This fact has been proven because over 70% of the students grade in a school increased just by letting them use cell phones. Increased student grades will make the parents happy, the word would spread, and the school will get more students to join their school

The use of cell phones will also make a lot of kids happy. The students would be more eager to attend school than normal. Once students start liking the school, they will try more and they will tell their peers about how great their school is. Their peers will mention this to their parents and the parents would let their child join the school. Therefore, letting the use of cell phones in school can benefit the school greatly with no loss. The students would be happy, the parents would be happy, and the school would be happy. So, letting students use cell phones ONLY during their free time would benefit everybody greatly and make everybody happy.

Many people would say that the use of cell phones is hazardous for a school. But, the cell phones wouldn't be hazardous if the school makes rules on the activities done on the cell phone. They should make rules such as, "Only text or call the people you know" and "No violating other school rules". This should keep everybody safe and happy in the school. If any serious issue pops up due to the use of cell phones, then there is no problem with banning the use of cell phones later. Students probably would want to keep their privileges, and so they probably will keep themselves from doing something that will take their fun away. The school should say that they are serious, and this will keep the students of the edge of their chairs, and make them scared.

The use of cell phones could possibly not cause any bad things in school. It will make everybody happy, including the school, parents and students. What is wrong with a little fun in the days of the hard working children? Cell phones should only be used during the students' lunch period or their free time. If anybody is caught with using cell phones during their class time, then there is nothing wrong with these extraordinary privileges to be taken away. I hope you would consider the choice of letting students use their cell phones during their free time to provide a school day with enjoyment.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
