Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Many may agrue that students should continue getting their education in the summer, but the summer time is when students get a break from school. Summer projects should be student designed because many students want to enjoy themselves and work full time jobs.

During summer break many students choose to enjoy themselves. The entire time while on the break the project that needs to be completed will be on students minds. Students designing their summer projects can give them an opportunity to finish the task and enjoy themselve. In contrast, with teachers designing projects students are least likely to get completed during the break because of how uninterested they are. Many may disagree that all students isn't going to complete the projects, which is true most students care more about getting tasks done than others.

Students who want to make money in the summer decides to work full time jobs, projects will be the last thing on their mind, its important that the project is something that students interest. Working and having to do a project can be alot, but some students can weigh things out and make it happen. Not everyone can multitask sometimes people's mind be set on one thing at a time. However, students may take control in completing the project they designed. Many may agrue that students wouldn't think about the project and work at the same time, but with students designing the project it may incourage them to complete the it.

Projects may not be the most exicited thing in the world but if schools required it students will be more likey to complete it if they designed it. Summer break is a time where students want to get a break from school, have fun, or make money. Projects can't completing ruin students summer break but it can ruin their grade, its more reasonable to give students a project that may catch their eyes. Many may agrue that students don't think about doing any work in the summer time, but if the work is something that interesting students may take toll on completing it.
