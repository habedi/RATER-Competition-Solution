The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My three reasons are to make friends, better chance to get into college, and develop character traits.

The first reason is that it is easier to make friends. Most people struggle with making friends. It would be easier if you knew you had something in common with them. when you are in one of these activities you're there with kids who enjoy what you enjoy. Not only is making friends a good reason to do extracurricular. Another one is you get better chances to get into college

Colleges look for people with not only good grades ,but extracurricular they look for people that will fit with the curriculum. When I was in seventh grade my language arts teacher told the class that people with more extracurricular get in college more often. Not only is a chance to get into college a reason to take extracurricular a great.

Another one is to develop character traits. If you are the captain or president of whatever you're doing you are developing leadership ,but you also know that it can be taken away. Sports teaches you teamwork,discipline, and a lot of other things. You can even learn new skills that you never knew you had.

Extracurricular are important to your life because they can teach you many things and make your future easier. Most people struggle at different things.
