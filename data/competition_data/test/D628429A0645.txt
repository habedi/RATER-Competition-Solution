Dear Sir or Madam:

I think the new policy regarding that students can't participate in sports if they have a C average. First, I believe that this is not fair because of struggles. For example, If they are struggling in a class it is not their fault they are trying to the best of their abilities.

I also believe that this new policy is wrong because they can still pass with a C. For example, if they are not failing I don't think that this policy is fair because a test they didn't do well on might have brought their grade.

Furthermore, I think if we should make a policy similar to yours, but a little more flexible. For example, If they have one E I think that is more justice then a B average.

Another reason that l think this policy shouldn't be passed with the requirements of having a B average to participate in any activities; therefore, if students have a C or D grade they shouldn't have to give up their way to represent our school.

To conclude, I think that the new policy shouldn't be passed because the students struggle time to time.

From,

STUDENT_NAME
