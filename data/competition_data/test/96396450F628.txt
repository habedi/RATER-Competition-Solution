In this story, scientists are wanting to explore Venus. The thing is, Venus is really hard to study due to its spot in our Solar System. There are many dangers that come with studying Venus. For starters, Venus is the second planet from our sun, which means the temperature on Venus can be very hot and mild. Venus may be simple to see from a vantage place on earth but it has been proven to be very challenging to examine more closely.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Some things may be easier to see observe on Venus because it is so much like Earth, wrong, due to the weather and history, Venus isnt a walk in the park. Many spacecrafts have been sent to Venus but since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, the missions remained unnamed. A spacecraft hasn't landed on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors help with the reputation of Venus, and that shows how challenging it really is to get more information than what we already have.

Venus has a very thick atmoshere of 97% including carbon dioxide blankets. What makes it even more challenging for us is that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere of Venus. The conditions on Venus are known to be far more extreme than our conditions on eath. Venus can destroy a submarine and turn any metal into a liquid. Venus has the hottest surface temperature in our solar system even though it is not the closest planet to the sun. Beyond the high pressure and heat on Venus, it also has many valcano eruptions, powerful earthquakes, and pretty frequent lightning strikes.

Another issue we have is no machines last on Venus. No machine lasts long enough to contribute meaningful knowledge about Venus. Simplified electronis tend to not work for more than a few hours at a time before they burn or break, and some even last for up to three weeks but hardly collect any information. A project they are wanting to bring back is an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices played an important roll in World War Two. This device doesn't require any devices at all.

Venus is a very challenging planet to learn about. Many things stop us from learning about Venus but no one has given up hope yet. They are doing everything they can in there power to make it to Venus to learn more about it. Venus has made us face some pretty harsh challenges, including human curiosity. We are very interested in learning more about Venus and they are hoping that us being curious will get them more help to see what else Venus has in store.
