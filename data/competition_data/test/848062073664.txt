Is studying Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In my opinion if you would like to devote your life to the study of venus and go preform test on Venus then what ever makes you happy. How ever the author is more on the side of why go and waist all of the resources needed to go to Venus.

In the begining of this passage the author states "

human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason," which leads me to beileve that he doesnt understand why they keep trying and waisting resources and money. Then in paragraph four he states " if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface" which moves me to think that he beileves that Venus is so "inhospitable" that we shouldnt even waist time experimenting to in hopes find our second earth.

When reading this I hope you take time to think about the importantce of this article and you have time to think what should we do? Should we go do more test in hopes Venus could be our second earth or just stay here and spend the time and money fixing our earth.
