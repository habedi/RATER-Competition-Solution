Studying Venus is a great idea. We study Venus because it was like the twin to earth they are very close in size and density. if anything was to happen to the earth we as humans would want a fall back plan and somewhere to be able to go if anything bad happens on earth. Scientist are trying to find ways to get spacecrafts on venus for longer then a few hours.

Venus has a bad environment. they have 97% carbon dioxide blankets in their atmosphere also their clouds have sulfuric acid in them and some of there temperatures hvae reached up to 800 degrees fahreneit. This isnt good because it is 90x worse then what ernesoerience om our planet. Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any planet in our solar system. I know what you are thinking why would we want to live on venus with all bad things on the planet but its the most earth like planet in our system it was covered with oceans just like earth and could have supported forms of life just like earth does.

Our technology isnt good enough to withstand the environment on venus right now. NASA wants to make a blimp like vehicle that could float in the air instead of the ground. This could help with seeing through the clouds and still finding out and seeing whats going on when horrible storms come around. thsi is also not a good idea though because being up innthe air you would have to see the surface. Lots and lots of researchers are trying to find ways to make machines that could help us study venus.

Venus would be a good back up plan for if anything happens on earth and we need a place to live after. I support the idea of trying to make ways for us humans to live on Venus. If we find away to live on Venus we wouldnt have to worry about humans and other living organisms dying out like the dinosaurs did.
