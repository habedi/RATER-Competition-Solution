Every person has a phone. Every driver has a phone. Then when the drivers look at their phones is unsafe. People are glued to their phones and it's not healthy and not safe. The world would be a better place if we monitored our phone time and made it against the law it would a better and safer world.

It is unsafe for a driver to use a cell phone while driving. The distraction it causes for not only the driver but by the riders too is dangerous it could even be life threating. While operating a cell phone you lose focus on everything around you. So, we should monitor the places and times for people being on their phones.

The way it distracts a person is so unhealthy for your eyes and totally unsafe for you and your surroundings. How if you cannot pay attention in class on aa phone should you be able to drive. I personally believe phones shouldn't be able to be in the front parts of the car.

In conclusion, I believe that you shouldn't be allowed on your phones while driving. Driving a car can be very dangerous, so we shouldn't be on our phones while driving. The way we look and on our phones is so unhealthy and dangerous.
