The Facial Action Coding System from the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D'Alto shows that Dr. Paul Huangs invention would be a great upgrade for schools. It is a great advance in technology for everyone around the world . It is creative and intellegent. The technology could make dramatic changes to the future.

To begin with the technology itself can tell how a person is feeling. It recognizes the human muscles in the face and can tell when a person using it, is fake smiling or smiling because they're happy. "Eckman has classified six basic emotions ,happiness,surprise ,anger ,disgust, fear , and sadness and then associates each with characteristic movements of the facial struture." The technology itself is incredible , now imagine students using this to their education advantages.

And then students would be able to change what they're learning with how their emotions are showcased. " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." It would be such a great idea to have technology to interact with students such as those who have an attention shortspan. "Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor." The technology could really bring out the understanding of an individual such as a student.

To sum it all up , this new technology would be a great impact for generations to come. It would help out emotionally, scientifically and personally. It would help students realize what they are and aren't intrested in , and it would help the teachers understand where the students are struggling in as well and how they can help them in subjects they dont quite well understand. And scientifically the technology can help modern technology advance as it said in the aticle on how an ad could keep playing if shown intrest or could skip to a different one if shown none.
