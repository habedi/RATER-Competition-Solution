Do the students make up the school or do the teachers? Yes, the teachers make up the school. So if the teachers make up the school, should the students get a say on what work they have to do. I dont think you can teach yourself without knowing what you have to do. So if it were up to the students they would probably slack off,

Instead of really pushing their self to their limit. Teachers should design the summer projects, so the students can really learn something.

Personally if I got to design my summer project. I would do something easy to get a good grade. I feel like the summer projects are to hard, so I would make them easier. Now if you look at it from a students' point of view the teachers that design the summer project aren't worried about what the student can do. For example if I see a worksheet that is to hard I just give up. I can't myself to do something i can't do.

The work for students is really hard because they still have so much to learn. But it doesnt give them the right to slack off. Students can't learn with a worksheet they need like some teaching to go with it. Teachers should design a little extra so that the students can actually learn something. All that's really going on is the students working on their skills. Therefore, I believe teachers should design all the summer projects.   Â
