I think that it would be good for the students especially for the ones who struggle. Students can be smart if they just would put courage into their work like I do. The principal is doing the right thing, maybe kids will try harder and give it all they got. I think that maybe if kids really want to do sports maybe they will think about their school work first. My parents always told me that if my grade was low i had to stay home and study after school and on weekends so that meant no running around with family or friends. That helped me though because I started passing my test. I just have that habit of going home do some study and homework and then going and doing what I enjoy most and that is riding my horse. Students would be more careful with their work if they knew they had to have a B average to play in any kind of sports.

The principal was smart for coming up with something like this. Our students wouldn't be where we are to today without our teachers, parents, and our principal. Thanks to them we are strong and independent people that we are. If i had to choose i would go with the B average because it would be a challenge for us. I am always looking for a challenge in anything I do because I know I can do it if I put my mind to it.

Some students would struggle but that's it they say hey i could careless and thats defiantly not the right to say at all. You want to believe you can do it not hey its just another day at school. The job i want I want to be good at my school work I need all the education I can get. I try to tell my friends that homework is not really that hard if you pay attention and not slack off in class that way you know how to do your homework right at home. The principal and your teachers are just trying to help you for your future ahead of you.
