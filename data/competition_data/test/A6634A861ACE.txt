I am going to be writing about a story called A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves. the things that I am going to put in here are reasons why Luke's convincing others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Other Cowboys should join in the Seagoing Cowboy program because there are a lot of horses and other animals that they could help take care of. The next thing would be because they get to go on cattle-boat trips that are unbelievable oppurtunities for a small-town boy. The third reason would be because the Cowboys get to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. The last reason why others should join is because when Luke said that it was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

Now I am going to tell you details that support Luke's claims. At the beginning of the story it said that Luke had been working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. UNRRA ( The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas so Luke and Don signed up. In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14, Luke says that the day the Pacific war ended. They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe And China. Luke says that the cattle-boat trips were unbelievable oppurtunities for a small-town boy. caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. Luke found time to have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. It opened up the world for Luke Bomberger.

So what I wrote about in the story was about a story called A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves. The things that I put in the story were about reasons to join the program and to support Luke's claims. Like for the first one I put that they could like play baseball or volleyball on their free time. That they could get to take care of animals (lots of animals). Like in the second one I used ideas from the story for that paragraph. Thanks for reading hope you enjoyed.
