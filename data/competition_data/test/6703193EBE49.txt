Many people argue whether or not summer projects should be designed by students or by teachers. These summer projects would help the students continue learning while on break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they would challenge the students, teachers have a better understanding of the information, and the projects would prepare students for the school year.

The first reason why summer projects should be teacher-desinged is because they would better challenge the students. Challenging projects cause students to learn the information better. Students must think outside the box in order to actually learn something. A challenging project is one that causes students to have to conduct research, and if the students research for their projects then they would higher chance of remembering the information. If the projects were student-designed then the students would take the easy way out and make the projects easier, which does not help the students grow in any way. Easy projects would cause the students to take less time on it and forget the information faster. Teachers would not only make the projects more challening, but also more reliable.

The second reason why projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers have a better understanding of the information. Students haven't learned the information yet, so the projects that are student-designed would be less reliable than the teacher-designed projects. The teachers know the information because they teach it every year, so the projects would be thorough. If the students designed a project with out completely knowing the information then they could be setting other students up for failure. Teachers have a syllibus to work off of and students do not, so if the students designed the projects they could hurt and not help. The teacher-designed projects would be more helpful for students because teachers better understand the information, and the projects would give students insight on the following year.

The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they would prepare students for the upcoming year. Teachers have the whole year planned out before the start of school, especially returning teachers. Because they have the year planned, they know exactly what information is on the syllibus. The projects the teachers would design would be better than the ones student-designed because they would be planned according to what will be taught during the school year. This would help the students get an idea of what the year would be like and have a better understanding of the information before the start of school.

Many people disagree on whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. The projects, designed by either students or teachers, would continue the education of students through the break regardless of who creates them. Student-designed projects would help students learn because people their own age understand their learning techniques better than teachers; however, summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would better challenge the students, the teachers know the information better, and the projects would give the students an idea of what the school year would be like.
