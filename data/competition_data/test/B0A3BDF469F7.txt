Dear Reader,

I agree with the principle that students that have a C should not be able to participate in sports and that only students with an above B average should be able to participate in sports.

I agree with this argument because I believe with freedom comes responsibility's.

The freedom would be the school sports and the responsibility's would be the grade.

Sports are a privileged you need to take good actions in school to earn them. I also believe that school is more important then sports.

To get any where in life you need an education.

Without a good education it's hard to get any where in life.

Usually with sports, they wont help you with life.

On a chance from one to a hundred, a two is probably the highest chance you have at getting a career in life for a sport.

I believe that all sports turn up that way.

Another reason why I agree that students with an above B average should only be able to play a sport is because if you end up going to a college on a scholarship for example like football, you have to have a good average grade or else you wont be excepted into that school.

It doesn't matter how good of an athlete you are. To play on a college team you have to have the good grades.

No grade no game.

School is very important in life.

Without it we wouldn't have the technology that we have today.

Sports have brought us nothing but entertainment.

I admit it can be fun but it doesn't get you anywhere in life.

I play in a sport myself.

I am a swimmer and I love swimming very much.

I actually want to get a scholarship for swimming to MSU.

But there is a high chance that, that will ever happen.

But if i didn't have good grades and averages in school, my parents wouldn't let me play.

So school always comes first in my book and even when I would rather swim or run instead of homework I usually make the right choice.

I have to think about what is best.

If i don't do my homework then I will get bad grades. And if i have bad grades then i wont be able to swim or run. So that gets me know where.

So the right thing to do is do my homework then have fun.

I believe that students that have a C average should not be able to play in sports, but i do believe that a student with a B average or higher should get to participate in sports.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
