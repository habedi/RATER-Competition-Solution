Dear principal,

There is no doubt, that children should do community service. I believe it is a great & fun way to give back to the community. Community service is a great way to show us how to be responsible. If we clean up the beach all of the sea creatures will live and be cared for all because of community service. Tutoring is also another great idea because we have now gave the child a chance at go middle school, high school, & even college. We should all be given a chance at life.

Community service is another great way us how to make great decision in life. We are what make tomorrow so why not make it sunny

& bright. By just changing one beach imagine what we can do to the world. The world is beautiful place so why not show it off a little.

If we do these thing about 2 hours a day we can and will change our world. Which is what we have been waiting for all our life.
