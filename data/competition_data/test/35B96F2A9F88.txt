Dear Principal

I've heard of the new cell phone policies, one where we get to use our phones during lunch and free time, or don't use our phones at all. I think policy 1 is better than policy 2, not just because I'm a student but because i think it's better. Policy 1 states: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I think that sounds way better that not having phones at all. just think about it, what if something happens to a students mom and she cant take her son home, and if she tries to contact him, he wont be able to know because you chose policy 2. But if you chose policy 1, the student would call his mom back during lunch or free time and find out what happened. See, that makes policy 1 sound way better than policy 2. Now, what if their are some sneaky students and want to text in class? Well, tell the teachers to have a box and collect all of the student phones in the begging of class and return them back to the students at the end. It's that simple! This is just my opinion, but if you like it then thank you and i hope you choose policy 1.
