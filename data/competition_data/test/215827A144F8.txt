The Face Action Coding System would be great for classrooms because it would also help the teachers alot becuase as soon as you walk in the room it would let the teacher know if you are mad, sad, happy,etc. As Dr. Huang said "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression" watching tv that can change your emtions. so imagine that you had a bad day at school and you are just getting out an you are mad about something that happen at school an you want stop being mad, just watch tv that sometimes helps people alot. Then when you turn on the tv use the Facial action coding system.

People sometimes dont know what mood there in at school, some people love coming to school, some hate it, but some people dont like to be bothered. Alot of people like to stay to themselves at school, so maybe using the FACS would make thhat student angry, when probably that person was in a happy mood so it works both ways if you ask me but i really do think the FACS would be good for class rooms.
