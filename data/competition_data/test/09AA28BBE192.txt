Dear Principal,

I have heard that you have made a new rule, that any students that do not have a B average can not participate in any school activities, including sports, music and more. I fully believe that you are on the right track, students need to be able to keep up with there school work and activities. I think that if the student is passing the class they should be able to participate, not be able to, because they do not have a B average.

Most Junior High or High School kids may get a C or a D as long as they are not failing in the class and is doing pretty well I believe they should still be able to participate. If the student may get a C or a D they should be talked to or informed by a teacher to be warned they need to improve on there school work in order to participate in the school activities. Many students that are involved in sports and after school activities juggle them, school work, chores at home, and somewhere in there sleep. It is a big responsibility for some students, and may mean a lot to them. So if a student may get a C or a D on a couple of papers which will bring there grade down to a C they should still be able to attend whatever they may be interested in. As I said in the beginning of my letter, the student should still be notified about his or her grade and that they may need to find some extra credit to bring the grade up, or a tutor, or even just working harder!

I am glad you are listening to the views of the students to see what we have to say. Grades are very important, I just think it would be more fair if students could still attend the events unless they were not passing. I hope I have helped in some way, I really hope you understand what I had to say every student should be able to attend or participate in whatever they may like with out a failing grade.
