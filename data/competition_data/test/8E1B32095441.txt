The students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

Attend classes from home sometimes is good idea but this not mean that is the best option that you can take, many people take this like a necessity because they maybe do not attend classes to school or simply to the school, we cant say that this not function or that you do not have benefits in this option but really you have benefits in this point, i can say and can tell you an example, my sister when we come to this country for her age she can not enter to the high school but my family and she knows that only can take the option classes from internet or attend classes in other school or course of English, because the English is the language in this country when you come here you need learn this language because you can not communicate with others persons, so she take that option and her homework everything she make for internet, she is still in that process but i can see that now she can talk and understand so good the English and she have time for other things like work, go to super market, laundry, church, visit he family and many things she said that for her this is a good option for persons that can take regular class in some school or maybe in sometimes people offer classes for internet with the minimum percentage or price about money.

If in my future i will have the option or i can take or attend to university i will take this, why? because this will help me and i will have time for make my things like if i work go to work, my family somethings like that, this have benefit of course, i know about my friend he take too her classes from internet and he said that this help to him because he work and when he can in the nights or day he can continue his classes, that mean that this option or this theme about our question is yes, this have or offer benefit to people that take this he said that for his diploma about his career each semester he take a exam for check his advance but he have the option that when he is ready for take the final exam he can do it, but if he do not pass the final exam he can take again, so i think that this is a great point because you do not lose the opportunity for your diploma about your career.

We know that everything have two sides: the good sides and the bad side and in this opportunity take classes from home have benefits but too have disadvantages because in many times for think that we can do that forget take the classes because we have many things that we need to do, about my friend that i tell you before about his experience about this point, he had a great option if he can pass the final exam, but the problem is when or if he can not pass the classes he need pay more money like one more year or any quantity that they tell him about the study or about his career so in that, we can said like that is the disadvantage.

I know about people that many companies lie to them and steal money because they do not research before to take that.

So about our question yes this have benefits from being able to attend classes from home, but don not forget that everything necessity be research and think good, about our decisions for will have a great future.
