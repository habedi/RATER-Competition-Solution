Dear Principal,

I think that this new policy is generally a good idea. Many students feel that they need to focus more on their sports than on their schoolwork. If they are told they cannot be on a team unless they have good grades, it will encourage them to do better, let them focus on what they need to do, and learn to balance out their time. All are good skills to have in our lives.

First, this policy will encourage better grades and habits. Young people like being on a team and cooperating with others. If they need to do well in school for this to happen, all the better! Then, everyone gets what they want.

Next, it will apply focus in our lives. The youth of today are always being distracted by the technology we have created. In most cases, technology helps us achieve educational goals, but we cannot concentrate on school if we are listening to music, playing video games, or chatting on the social websites. Sports are important in our lives and we want to keep it like that.

My last reason is balance. Time is a wonderful thing to have, if used properly. Balancing our schedule out helps to keep us on the right track. This concept is arguable, but consistency in a person's young life helps with consistency in future jobs. Having time for schoolwork, sports, fun, and responsibilities is always a good thing and will keep teens on the track to where they want to be.

As I said before, all these concepts are arguable, but it is my belief that organization and balance is a good thing for us. This new policy would enforce that idea and give incentive for better habits. Whether it's used for encouragement, focus, or balancing time, it will help.

Sincerely, Student
