When looking at the Facial Action Coding System and seeing what it did for this peinting, I think it would be a great idea to use in the classrooms to reqd the students emotional expressions. Dr. Haung observes that many artists likr da Vinci did, and he relized that tney studied human anatomy, this is how they were abel to paint facilmuscles precisely. Dr. Haung relized that by haveing a machine like this one, doctors would be abel to performe better surgery by useing video surgery and or better graphics for video games, beter quality images of human faces and better muscel pictures would become a huge hit in the medical field.

Dr. Eckman and Dr. Haung were both abel to figure out that if you raise your lips at the corner of your mouth, squint your eyes slightly, and raise the outer parts of your cheeks toward your eyes, your lab partner would be clueless on what emotion you were performing. These are the instructions on how to look happy says Dr. Haung. The Facial Action Coding System can even detect when you are forcing a fake smile instead of a real simle.

This is why I feel that putting the Facial Action Coding System into schools acros the globe would be a good thing. Not only would this give the schools feed back on how their students mental state changes throughout the day, but also this machine would help detect early signs of depression and posibly signs of bullying. When students tell teachers they are not getting bullied or hurassed, the Facial Action System might be abel to detect when a student is lying an d or not wanting to share all of the details in his or her life.

These are all the reasons I personally think the Facial Action Coding System should be placed in schools everywhere. People were interested in the face and how the mucels work even whe da Vinci was alive all the way to today when we are atill intdrested in how the fave and muscels not only work, but how they can be minipulated and how each emotion brings on different muscels.
