Others should not participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a very dangerous and risky thing to do. The waves can also make people scared because they don't want the ship to flood and sink.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is not good for your body. It can get you seriously injured like when Luke Bomberger slide down a slippery latter on his backside and cracked his ribs. Luke Bomberger almost died by flying over the edge of the ship, but a small strip of metal alonge the edge stopped his slide. That is a way you can die participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Another reason the Seagoing Cowboys program is bad for you is because you can get sick. You can get seasick by being on a boat too long. This could lead to you throwing up. You can also get homesick by being away from home, sailing too much. You also take the risk of getting killed or drowning and never seeing your family again.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is bad for your body. You can risk getting sick, injured, or dying. Therefore others should not participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
