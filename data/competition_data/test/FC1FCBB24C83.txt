Cell phones Vs Driving

I believe that people being allowed to operate a motor vehicle must never also be allowed to have their phone in their hand while doing so. Cell phones make driving much more dangerous by distracting the driver from the road. In 2019 The state of Georgia made it illegal for driver's to have their phones in their hand while driving. This law is called the "Hands-Free" law. Since this law has been put into place a lot more Georgia driver's have been able to reach their destinations.

I'm on the side of banning any amount of cellphone usage while driving, texting and driving is extremely dangerous and has been proven time and time again of being one of the most common causes of death in the United states. Fun fact actually, more people die from texting and driving than from sharks... So why do we keep letting people do something that we know is more dangerous than swimming with sharks? Because people nowadays are almost addicted to being on their phones. People have become too consumed in the fake reality of phones and social media that they value texting while driving more than their own life it seems. And because of that I strongly believe that driver's should NOT be able to use their phone in any capacity while driving. Sure they may be helpful with navigation and helping you find out where to go, but there are also a million other different distractions that come with the cell phone like the notifications, emails, ringtones, snapchats, and tweets that also come with it and are completely unnecessary while driving.

I hope that society comes to their senses and realizes how dangerous and unnecessary phones are when it comes time to drive a motor vehicle. A text can always wait, but someone's life cannot, a text or phone call is never worth the life of a person. I think that banning all cell phone usage in motor vehicles is a necessity and it should be implemented as soon as possible.
