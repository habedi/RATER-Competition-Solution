Dear Principal:

I would like to discuss my idea on how the policy of not being able to participate in sports or any school activities just because of a grade, such as a C average or below. Many students do not have a B average, but it's not just because of the sports and coming home late. Many students have problems at home or at school that should be discussed with any counselor, in or out of school. In my opinion, students with a C average should be able to participate in any school sport or activity that is being provided and is available.

If a student has any of their grades at a C average, they should be required to see a school counselor to discuss what is going on in school or at home and why they have those types of grades. Also, many students just don't understand the subject clearly or have problems with that subject. It might even be the teacher, but you can only find out if the student visits the counselor and widely discusses what is going on in their life.

Also, if students with those grades do not have a chance of being in a school sport or activity because of their grades, the school just might miss out on how well the students plays or does in that sport/activity. For example, the student enjoys playing the sport volleyball, is on the team, and is the captain of the team and suddenly her class grade in History drops because of any problem she is having, yet you don't know what the problem is. You will lose a great player and even lose school games. You will not just want your school to be recognized as a great and fabulous academic school, but also a school who does sports/activities and wins them too.

The only problem or situation there could be is if they drop below a C average, even after talking to the counselor. But that's not just going to be the students problem, it will be the counselors too, because the counselor might have not listened and directed well on what they shall do to bring the grade or grades up and focus on grades and the sports only.

So I suggest using my idea, because you control what goes on in this school, and I feel very opinionated on this policy. No student shall be kicked out of any type of school sport or activity without having any idea of what is going on in their life. Thank you.

Sincerely, a concerned student
