Twenty five years ago, NASA's VIking spacecraft snapped a photo of what looks like a human face on a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia. Many people believed the Face was created by aliens, but NASA found evidence that it was equilavent of a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact, but a landform.

The photo captured by the Viking 1 was very poor quality. In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor captured a photo using the camera's maximum resolution. Each pixel spans 1.56 meters, while a pixel on the original photo spans 43 meters. What the 2001 picture actually showed was equivalent of a mesa or butte. These are common landforms on Earth around the American West. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Porgram said,"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

People seem to believe everything on the internet or media. The Face on Mars has appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even starred in a Hollywood film. The media has brainwashed people to thinking the Face on Mars is an alien artifact, with no scientific evidence or proof. People have been believing the media's theories on the Face over NASA's scientific research that the Face is actually a landform.

NASA has found evidence over the years that the Face on Mars was not made by aliens, but people still refuse to believe it. The original photo was taken in low quality, as technology was not as advanced back in 1976. Now that NASA has taken higher resolution photos of the Face, we can conclude that the Face on Mars is a mesa. People still refuse to believe NASA, even after seeing the evidence, but one day, they will come to the relization that the internet is full of lies and conspiracies.
