Should schools require students complete summer projects during the summer? Honestly I think if your behind like at the end of the year you could do these summer projects to get you caught up, that would help a lot of students like me. I think they should be designed by the students after all it's our summer. I just dont think school should be pushing us like that we're to young for that. They already keep us in school for about eight or nine months then most students work really hard to get to where they need/want to be.

Me personally, I would want the teachers to design the projects but only since its summer I would not be ok with that. Most students put in so much work just to get a couple more pointless projects during the summer at lease if the the students design it will be something simple, but not to simple. I already know if the teachers design it would be something that's so difficult and extra and it's the summer so they will say something like you had all the time in the world to complete this. But thats not how its supposed to be it should be something I could complete in a week or two. We shouldnt have to go to school for that long just to get stuck with some summer projects design by some teachers that probably dont even know me.

Maybe if the teachers and the students designed the projects together we could come up with something. I would not care if it wasn't the summer but I can't lie projects in the summer would be smart. The only thing is I feel like the teacher would just throw something at us. If it was graded like extra credit or something when school start that would be way more motivation to get ahead way before school even start. Sometimes we just need a break, just a small one because we do so much in and out of school y'all teachers and staff don't know what goes on out of school, they never do.

In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects but the teachers should check of on them to make sure they're not to easy. We work hard through out the school year just to get to the summer and i dont think it should be to hard for them or to long. During school, most teachers gives us little time to do the most difficultÂ projects in the school year, just like last year. Even tho we should be relaxing in the summer this is kind of a neat idea and would keep us on task for the next school year. We all can contribute to designing summer projects so we could stay focus.
