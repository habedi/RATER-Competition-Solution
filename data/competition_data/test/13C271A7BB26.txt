If you were to ask the average student if they wanted to come to school everyday, they would most likely say no. They might say, school is too tiring and it causes too much stress for them to go for all five days in a week. Furthermore, with the amount of homework students are given, a day off would help them to catch up. On the contrary, missing school will negatively effect learning. One solution to this would be, video conferencing classes. Video conferencing classes would help students escape from the stress of school, while still being able to learn the same as their peers.

A vast majority of students would say their school days are too stressful to be doing five times a week. My high school started a program this year, where teachers follow a student around for a school day and go to all of their classes. This program has further acquainted teachers of the amount of stress that we go through in a day. However, school is not a students only stress factor. A good majority of students also participate in extracurricular activities, play sports, and work a real job. Most adults cannot go to school and work a job. That is why these adults, who want to go back to school, enroll in an online college. Not only are they cheaper than a four-year college, online schooling provides adults with the time to take care of a family and work a full-time job.

Video conferencing classes could also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases. We are currently in the middle of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, so limiting human contact is the best way to prevent the spread of it. Many countries have begun online schooling to keep their students and staff healthy. Places like China and Italy are online schooling to reduce the risk, and I dont think it will be long before we start doing the same. While the disease is not very deadly to us, we might spread it on to someone else with a weaker immune system.

With the proper training, any teacher could learn to teach an online class. One disadvantage of video conferencing classes would be that, students might zone out or disassociate from the class they are in just because they are not present in the room. Teachers can install software on the students computers so that the teacher can see what the student is currently viewing, so if a student is cheating or playing games instead of doing classwork, the teacher will know about it. Although the transition to online classes will be a difficult one, I believe that online classes will more benefit students than it will hurt them.
