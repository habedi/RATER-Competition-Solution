The challenge of exploring Venus seems very difficult but they want to evaluate it more. It is very hard to get really close because it is to hot for a human to get there. The heat can melt or destroy devices and there would be no information. They have sent many spacecrafts on the cloud-draped world and they have not made it, so they don't send humans. There is a lot of harsh condition in Venus like frequent lightning strikes and erupting volcanoes. They say that long ago Venus was probably almost like earth and could have supported various forms of life just like earth today. NASA probably has a way of sending humans to study Venus in a way that they would survive. They say that a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles over venus landscape. With jet airplanes traveling at a higher altitude to go over storms. The vehicle would not be touching the ground so it can avoid the hot ground conditions. The vehicle going at thirty plus miles above surface would still be hot at around 170 degrees Farenheit, with air pressure close to sea level on earth would be hard but humans could survive and get information. They have made electronics of silicon carbide and put them to the test in conditions like venus. They have lasted for three weeks in those conditions. They also have thought of other devices from the 1800s with better mechanical parts to be more resistant. They are working very hard to get close and collect a lot more information about Venus. There is a big amount of challenges presented by Venus, but the value of discovering more with human curiosity will lead to meeting the very edges of Venus.
