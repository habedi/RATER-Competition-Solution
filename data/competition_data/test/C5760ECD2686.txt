The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" suggests the opinion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Throughout the article, the author brings up many of those dangers but also many ways to prevent them and all the upsides to visiting the planet. The author supports the idea very well throuhout the article.

The author begins the article by stating all of the dangers of actually having a human visit or land on Venus. The article mentions that no spacecraft has survived more than a few hours because of such harsh conditions. Those harsh conditions begin with the temperature. On Earth it is rare to get much higher than 110 degrees Fahrenheit, but on Venus, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahreheit. Venus is closer than Earth to the sun, with an atmosphere made up of about 97 percent carbon dioxide and with clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The author also mentions to worsen the conditions, it is common to have erupting volcanoes, major earth quakes, and big lightning strikes across the planet. To put these conditions into perspective, the author mentions that even Earth's deepest submarines would be crushed when placed on Venus.

After the author mentions all the horrible dangers of studying and visiting Venus, all the good that would come from the trip is brought up. For example, the author mentions that the planet is the most like Earth and it would be incredibly helpful to NASA and the whole world to research Venus and actually send someone to visit the planet. The author also mentions that at certain times, Venus is the closest to Earth which would make for a shorter travel time than visiting another planet. The author also highlights that Venus very well could hvae supported forms of life many years ago.

Lastly, to prove the opinion of the article, the author brings up counter arguments to all of the current dangers many people have about sending someone to Venus. The temperature issue is solved along with the air pressure issue when the author suggests the idea that NASA has to possibly send a blimp-like spacecraft to float around Venus, just 30 miles up and off the surface. The author states that this would reduce te temperature to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is actually phisically possible to live with, and a similar air pressure to the Earth's. Although this blimp idea will provide limited insight, a human could actually survive this trip.

In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The article supports this by first giving a list of dangers, then giving reasons to go through with the idea, and lastly presenting a way to fix previous issues. The author knows what he is talking about, addresses each issue strongly and confidently, and supports his idea very successfully.
