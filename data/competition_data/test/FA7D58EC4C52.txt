You are sitting at your desk drained from all the work the you have done through out the day. You are unbelievably excited to go home but then you remember the you have a sport after school and you are starting to get stressed and you are thinking when will I have time to do my homework, when will I have time to study for my test? I dont think it should be forced to have a extracurricular activity after school because some students are already committed to sports outside of school, it is not needed, and some students have jobs.

After school I am committed to gymnastics four days a week three hours every practice and if I had an extracurricular activity after school I would be tremendously stressed. I love gymnastics and if I were to quit because of school I would be thoroughly upset. School is very important and I want to do good in school but it will be hard to succeed in school if I have an extracurricular activity everyday. On nights I have gymnastics I dont get home until eight thirty to nine p. m. and it is already hard to get my work done but if I have an extracurricular it will only make it harder for me and my family.

Extracurricular activities after school are not needed. In life we would never need to know how to run a play in football or how to organize the yearbook. Yes it teaches how to be compatible and how to work together to get things done but we could easily learn that with having group projects in school. Most students will not grow up to be a famous football coach and the few that do could play football for the school. It should be a choice and not forced upon the students of the middle school and high school.

Most of the students in high school have jobs and it would not be fair to make them do an extracurricular after school and have them change their work schedule for that. I believe students should be able to do what ever they would wish after school and they shouldnt be forced to do football, cheer leading, or yearbook. The student should have a choice to do an extracurricular because I know some students are not involved in after school activities and they would wish to get involved but others are already committed to a sport of some kind or a job of some sorts. I can imagine balancing school, homework, studying, and a job must be hard but it would only make it harder if they had to do an extracurricular after school everyday.

Those are just few of the multiple reasons why extracurricular activities should not be forced upon the students of the middle and high school. It would be very stressful to try and balance all of that work out and still do good in school. It should very much be the students choice on whether or not they are going to do an extracurricular. It would multiply my stress if I had to do an extracurricular on top of the sport I already play. I just hope some students are open to the choice the principal made for our school.
