Would you like to have help at school with out even having to ask for it. A resorce that could read emotions would and is voluable in school today so kids can get the best out of learning. Technology is getting so good that it can now read emotions. In the artical "Making Mona Lisa Smile.'' Nick D'Alto talks about how computer solfware can help people with problems just by sencing there face emotions. Technology that is able to, identify mixed emotions, scietificly proven and tested to work, and helps in school, Should be put in all schools.

First off, technology that can identify mixed emotions is a great tool in school and every ware. For exampel it could help stop peolpe in court rooms or when you are talking to a offeser. It can tell what persont of feelings you have. It said that the Mona Lisa "... 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." (Pg.1)

This would help with identifying mixed emotions.

Secondly, It has been scientificly proven to work because Thomas Huang,and Nicu Sebe both from high colloges working on ways that humans and computers can communicate. They stared of with a "cumputer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."(Pg 3) They created "FACS" this classifies six basic emotions. "...happiness, surprise, anger disgust, fear, and sadness..." (Pg. 3) These are all emotions that students have and that could us help from a computer that cares.

Lastly, it would help with school. Kids could see a problem on the computer and give a confused look at it and it could pop up a screan with a help page or it could inform the teacher that you are haveing truble. Nick D'Alto stated " for example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." This would help at school so there could be less bad ad to pop up. This will help kids stay safe. If you have a problem and the computer could read your face it could modify that problem.

This would be a fantastic improvment in schools. It would help kid learn better and it could give teachers a break. It could even help istep graders. Computers in schools and all over the world should have face software because it knows unknow emotions, sceintest Thomas Huang and Nicu are proving it works, and it will help make kids life easyer in school.
