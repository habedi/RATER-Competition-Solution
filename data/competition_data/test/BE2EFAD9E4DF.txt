Dear, our school principle

I am writing this letter because i think we should use policy 1. I think we should use policy 1 because when we are in lunch and our parents call us it might be an emergency. Some us might just use are cell phones for texting or just for fun.

Also we should be allowed to use our phone during our free time is because sometimes we might have an embarrassing problem and we might not want to go to the office and use their phone we would rather use ours. We would rather use ours because we have more privacy and we wont feel so embarrassed.

Another reason why i think we should have policy 1 is because we can text or talk without getting in trouble and i will be very thankful. If we do get policy 1 a lot of students will be excited and might be able to talk to someone in another country. Some adults may think why cant they just call when they get home, well maybe they cant call when they get home is because that person may be 3 hours or more a head of our time. For example like Florida, New York, or any part in Europe.

I also think we should have policy 1 is because we might want to stay after school or go with our friends somewhere and that way we can let them know, but if we have policy 2 we wont be able to do that because we wont have our phone. We should also have policy 1 because if our parents forget to pick us up or need to tell us to walk they can text us or call us after school. Also if we need to call a uncle, aunt, or any family member for some reason it will be easy to contact them with our phones.

In conclusion i think we should have policy 1 because it will be easier to contact someone or just to talk or text with an old friend. Also we will be thankful for this policy and for our principle for allowing us to bring our cell phones. These were some reasons why i think we should have policy 1.

Another reason why i think we should have policy 1 is because we will have freedom to text and talk to our friends in other states or schools. This is why i think we should have policy 1 in our school. I hope you will understand this reasons why we should have policy 1 and why we will be very thankful to have this policy. Thank you for taking the time to read and understand this letter, and why i think we should have policy 1.
