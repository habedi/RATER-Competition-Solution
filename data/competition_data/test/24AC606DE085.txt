Community Service?

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a major need for our society. We need it to keep highways and parks clean. Without it, the parks green grass would die, and our highways wouldn't be used because of trash backups. What's even worse is that they pour half of it into lakes, ponds, streams, and especially the ocean. The animals occupying them are dying, in their own homes! I suggest that we start a program in our school to help save the environment from those who litter.

I think we should start with our local parks, maybe during an elective class, or after school. Then we could make posters, signs, and flyers to spread the news of what we're doing. Then others from our community could start helping us keep our environment clean. I believe that students will enjoy keeping our parks clean, so that they, and kids to come, may enjoy them. Keeping the environment clean, is an important job for everyone, including kids.

If adults teach their children to believe that littering is bad, and not to do it, littering will cease to exist. Everyone wants a nice world to live in, but the world is just like a plant, or maybe a pet. We need to take care of it. Without our love, and care, the pet, in this case, the planet, will die. We need to feed it, keep it clean, and never neglect it. Otherwise, our home, planet Earth, will die out, just as other extinct animals.
