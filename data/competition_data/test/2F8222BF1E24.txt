I was getting lonely on board with the normal crew all day everyday. I had an idea to try and see if some of my friends would want to help me with my job as a Seagoing Cowboy. with my luck some of them said, "Yeah sure!", but some of them were too busy. I asked the captain if I could invite some of my friends so I could have more fun, and so we could get more work done on the boat.

The captain thought about it for a little while, and to my surprise he said yes! I was so happy that my friends and I could see Europe together! This all started because my friend Dan Reist invited me to help. A few days later me and my friends were helping out on the boat. Also we were playing games to pass the time. We had to make sure that the animals were safe, secure, and fed.

We all had a spendid time. We could be together until we got all of the countries back to normal, or even better! We could still help people even if we were done helping countries back to normal. I still chose to help people. It was the right thing to do, and most of my friends helpped, too.
