I think that it would be a great idea for students to do community service. It keeps the town looking nicer, people are happier, and if people see others doing community service, they just might help out as well.

If we had people doing community service it would make our town/community much cleaner. Like when people pick up litter. I know I hate seeing broken bottles and wrappers on the sidewalk. Or cleaner water. We wouldn't have to see chemicals in our once beautiful streams. Lastly, overgrown lawns. It is just disgusting to see someone's house being untreated like that.

I think people would be much happier if we had people doing community service. Like elderly homes. I'm sure some of the residents there wouldn't mind having visitors once in awhile. Town citizens would very much appreciate help. Like extra help at the library. Also, don't forget your parents. They would be so proud to have a son/daughter who does some volunteer work.

Lastly, if people see that people are doing community service, it might just influence them to do a little too. Like if someone works at the library. A person might actually say "Wow. They are making a lot of new friends here. Or if someone is cleaning a pond and a person sees them. They might say, " That pond is looking really nice, maybe I'll help too." Also, if a person is doing some yard work, a pedestrian walking by might see. They could say, " That owner of the house looks very happy. I should make a difference like that too."

In conclusion, I believe that it would be an awesome idea to have students doing community service. Our town would look much nicer, it would make people enjoy themselves a little more, and , hey, you never know. Someone might just walk by and say," That person is making a huge difference. Maybe I'll do some volunteering myself."
