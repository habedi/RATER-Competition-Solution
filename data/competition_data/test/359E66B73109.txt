Dear principal,

I am writing this letter to you to show what i think. i think that students should not be made to do community services. i believe in that because student should not be made to do anything, because some students have things to do like they have jobs, they might have to babysit for one of there younger siblings. and i don't think that is fair for them. Also if student are tutoring elementary children or cleaning up litter, they might not have anytime to things that they have to do at home like cleaning or homework.

If you need student for community services, ask students if they have anytime on there hands to do any tutoring or cleaning up litter. I'm pretty sure that a lot of kids have time on there hands for that but there are a lot of students that have time, and i don't think that is fair for them to be made to do something that they don't have time for. Another way to get children to do community service for the in community is if students are misbehaving in class maybe there punishment is to do community services. instead of detention or anything else in that category.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
