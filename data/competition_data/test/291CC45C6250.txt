Driverless cars should not be aloud. The roads are already unsafe, it could harm other people and It would be very costly to afford a driverless car. If we invented driverless cars it would become a problem. "In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car."

The roads are already unsafe. People are already reckless drivers and don't follow the rules or pay attention to the roads. If we were to get driverless cars, do you think people would more careful? Cars have sensors, cameras ,GPS etc. already built into cars. Why do we need cars that can drive by themselves? It is unnessisary for us to drive driverless cars. In the 7th paragrapgh is says " The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when a situation requires." If the car is driverless why would we have to take over it should be safe as possible?

Driverless cars could harm other people on the roads. If a car is incontrol, a human will not be able to stop it. With all of the technology getting put into cars we could be in big trouble in the future. Do you want a car that is driverless? More accidents could happen, if a driver is in the front seat and the car is driving by its self, and the person is not paying attention to the road and something is going on with the car do you think that would be safe?

Driverless cars could be very costly to people, with everything they are trying to put into cars, the cars could be very high in price. So why make them? If only a couple hundred people can aford them why waste all the time to build one. I think driverless cars should not be aloud. Think of someone you know in one, its very unsafe.

In conclusion, cars should not be driverless. The roads are already unsafe as it is, it could harm other people on the road, and it could be very costly. Driverless cars should not be aloud.
