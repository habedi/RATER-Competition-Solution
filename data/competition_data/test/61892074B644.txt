In cities such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, people are getting serious about cutting down on the vast usage of cars. The "car free" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of polluants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, "The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental Protecion Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By elimitating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.

With less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunites for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reportes Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, "The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant moter", and "Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks." Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.

An official from Transportation for America says, "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change." Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.

With many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere.
