Schools are places where students physically go to learn and study from. What if students can learn from their professors without going to school, instead, they learn online from their home? This is a good way for students to learn from their homes without having to miss a class lecture. Students will benefit from online conferencing, they will not miss a thing in class because of it.

Teachers and students may find online conferencing useful in many different ways. In perspective, students that are sick may not be able to come into class. Maybe students have a minor cold, but they are still able to take notes. So instead of missing out on important notes, students can learn online without the fear of missing anything because they are sick. I had a cold one time, and I knew I was going to miss out on a lot of English notes. I asked my friend if I was able to skype with him while he was in English class. My friend was able to skype with me and the teacher didn't mind if I was still taking notes at home. I got the notes I needed, and stayed at home knowing that I technically didn't miss class.

What if students aren't sick, what if they are away for vacation or an important occasion? Online video conferences will be the best thing for students away from their school and home. If students have the time to tune in for a online lecture, they won't miss notes for being away. Online conferences are very useful if the students are distant from class. In middle school, my friend was in France for spring break, and he wouldn't come back for another week. My teacher had already set up an online skype conference for him to join. My friend got the notes when he came back a week later, and did well on the assessment we had a few days after he came back.

Considering online conferencing, students may not find a video that was recorded and posted online helpful, because they could be distracted easier. Learning from a pre-recorded video needs more time to get into and receive notes from it. For example, a few of my friends refused to learn from a recorded video of our history notes, because they procrastinated instead of taking notes. The psychology is that students learn more on the spot, and are more into the lecture. Students may treat an online conference as real class time and get notes and work done.

People may think that online video conferences are just a way for students to stay at home and not come to school. That's just not the case, students will go to school if they are healthy, or aren't far away from home. Students can't go to school if they have a cold, or away from home. Students still learn from online conferences, even if they are home or not. Teachers should really take video conferencing into account in the future, if they don't already do. Online video conferencing will benefit academics in many good ways.
