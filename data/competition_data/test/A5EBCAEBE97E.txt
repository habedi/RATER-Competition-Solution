I am sure if a school has a options like this, many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because the students they going to make extra work after school at home in online or video conferencing. That is mean the students spend more time in do it extra classes in online and also they can abvance more in some classes. Thus helping to them for graduation more fast from school. After they can started more fast the college and finish youngers high school and college.

For example a builder if he has a job with benefit is more probable his state and make extra hours in the job and finish more fast. Also when a builder have more benefit like good machinery or more people working together, he can abvance more fast in the construction. The builder is going to construct more fast with the machenery and spend less time in a work. Thus overtake more and he is going to finish more fast the labor in his job. After the builder he would started a new work.

For example my cousin the last year he was soo frustrate with some classes. But after he went to the office and there the counselor tell him, that he has to take the class in online if he wanted graduation next year. The conselor offer to my cousin a capple classes in online, the class my cousin need and that moment. After my cousin he said "thanks to god this school have this benefit ". Now my cousin is going to graduation this year he has only to pass 3 classes more and after he graduation.

However some people they has this kind oportunity and benefit but they don't take. Although some people really want the benefit and oportunity and they really want overcome they don't think to much and they take this benefit in anyplace at school,in a job, even in a sport. At the school the students take this benefit in online or video conferencing they abvance in class they not waste time and they graduation early. In construction the builder he has a good benefit with the machenery and working in a group of people his abvance in any working and also win more money. My cousin he pass 3 classes in only now he is closet to graduation, the option of to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a good benefit for every students in the school.
