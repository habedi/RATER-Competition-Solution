Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should require students to perform community service because our community's land like the track behind the middle school, and the big parking lot and field where the middle schoolers have free time, behind the middle school isn't looking too spiffy. There's litter everywhere. So what we can do as a community is get some plastic gloves, some plastic bags, and more trash cans, and start picking up the litter, we also need to do better on looking out for people who bring food outside because one minute someone will be eating, then when the security guards aren't looking they'll throw their wrappers on the ground an walk away. So if a security guard does catch a student littering they should report them to the office and you should assign them a detention and community service. If we had more trash cans around the field then I think there would be less littering and if there still is littering then that's what community service is for. Thank you for your time, I hope you think about it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
