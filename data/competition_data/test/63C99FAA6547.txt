I think that driverless cars would be a very positive thing. Thre big reasons for this are that without drivers there would be less aciidents, they would be more efficient wih gas, and there would be no need for insurance. So overall a big improvement on todays society.

Firstly without drivers there would be less accidents. Now since since not everyone would be able to afford using them there will still be accidents butz the number will be drasticly reduced. Since the car is driving itself there is no way that the driver can drive recklessly therefore greatly reducing the number of car crashes. So even if one of the drriverless cars gets into an accident it would be the manufacturer's fault because they are the ones hat are really driving here. So overall a lot safer than what we have now.

My next reason is that these cars a lot more gas efficient. The reason I say this is that they would always obey the speed limit exactly. Doing this should cut down on the gas used and therefore be much more efficient. In the long run this sabes everyone money except the gas stations.

Lastly this should decrease the need for insurance. In the article they said that these would be more like a taxi service so if they are taxi than no need for people to have insurance on cars. If everyone used these than no more need for car insurance at all. Which in turn saves even more money for people. So overall very good cost wise for people.

So these driverless cars will be a very positive thing. They will reduce car crashes, be more gas efficient, and decrease the need for insurance. In conclusion these cars will be awesome.
