"There is an amazing program I joined called the 'Seagoing Cowboys'. It is amazing." I told a group of people outside a restaurant. "Well, you can't convince us to join if you don't give us reasons." said a man wearing blue overalls and a plaid shirt. To me, he looked a lot like a farmer. He looked just like a person the 'Seagoing Cowboys' were looking for. "Let's see. Well, first of all, sir, if I may ask, are you a farmer?" I asked the man wearing the overalls. "I sure am." he replied. "Do you enjoy taking care of horses, young cows, and mules?" I questioned him. "Of course I do. Why?" he asked. "The reason is, the 'Seagoing Cowboys' are a group of people who go to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. "Interesting," he said "Tell me more. "Other than helping people, I had the honor of seeing Europe and China. I also got to take a gondala ride in Venice, Italy, which is a city with streets of water." I added. "I always wanted to see Europe." the overalls man said. "Well then, if you want to take care of animals and visit other places in the world, you should join the 'Seagoing Cowboys!" I exclaimed. "I think I will!" the overalls man said. "How do I sign up?" he asked. I gestured towards the sign up booth. "Right over there" I replied. As he walked to the booth I smiled with happiness. "Another job well done Luke." I whispered to myself.
