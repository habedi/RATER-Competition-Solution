Dear principle,

I think that students should not have to have a Grade B average to participate in school sports and activities.

It is not fair to want at least a B grade average from all students.

Since some students may try their best in school but still not achieve a B grade.

Other students may have a learning disability and they should not be deprived of activities because of it.

Some students may have just moved to the country and not know the language and they may not do well in school at first but should still be allowed to play a sport or join a club.

Having a grade average lower that a B does not mean that is student is not smart, it may just mean that they need a little extra help from some teachers, to fully understand a lesson.

Since all students learn differently and are at different academic levels, it should be up to the teachers to decide if a student should be eligible to participate in a school activity.

Not the grade average that the school feels is best or fair for all students.
