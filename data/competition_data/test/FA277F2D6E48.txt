School is a critical in developing your brain. It allows you to jump through hoops and solve problems for seven hours a day everyday. Seven hours a day seems a little long, right? Going to school in person for seven hours a day is too long, so students should go to school through online classes. Students would benefit from taking classes online because they can get a proper amount of sleep, finish their work in time, and have enough time to enjoy other activities.

Taking classes online is more beneficial for students because they can get a proper amount of sleep. Students who attend school in person are most often extremely tired because of the constant workload they have to endure everyday. Seven hours of English, History, Math, and Science for five days straight every week. Staying up late studying for each class is detrimental to your sleep schedule. By taking classes online you don't have to worry about this problem. During an interview a student who attends online classes stated "Ever since I started online classes my sleep schedule has never been better. I at least eight hours of sleep every night." If you stay up late studying you can sleep in to make up the lost time. By doing online classes students are able to achieve a proper amount of sleep every night to feel energetic and refreshed each day.

Taking classes online allows you to get your work done on your own time. In school there are at least 4 classes that everyone must attend (English, History, Math, and Science). All of these classes require essays and projects to be completed by relatively similar due dates, but time in your day to work on these assignments is limited. Generic_Name, an eleventh grade student, said during an interview "The amount of school work assigned is too much to handle in one day sometimes because each class requires their own set of assignments, and there isnt enough time in one day to complete them all." To compensate for the limited time, students either have to stay up extremely late or get up early to complete these assignments. Taking classes online would allow students to divide the time in their day more evenly to complete assignments that are given to them. This allows more focus on tasks, which will in return produce better results from the work they turn in.

Finally, by taking classes online students are allowed more free time throughout the day to enjoy extra curricular activities. By being able to complete work at your own pace, the extra time you can potentially gain can be used to other activities. Some activities that could be enjoyed are include sports, music, and art. In a recent interview with the head of administration he said "Students who enjoy extracurricular activities are more adapt to learning and retaining knowledge." These students retain knowledge easier because they have an outlet for any occurring stress during school. By doing these activities they can release any pent up frustration, so when they go back to the classroom their minds are clear and focused.

Getting a restful amount of sleep, finishing your work, and having enough time for extracurricular activities are just some of the many benefits of taking classes online. Online classes are overall more beneficial for students, as it allows them to grow in areas that time wouldn't normally allow. By having more time they can also hone skills that that will help society as a whole advance in years to come.
