Venus is one of the brightest point in the sky called the "Evening Star". Venus is actually a planet in the solar system. Venus is the second planetfrom our sun. But our earth is more closely. Also earth is often referred a "twin" Venus is the closest planet to Earth due to the density, size, distance.

Same with Mars. These two planets Mars and Venus are close to earth. But all three of them orbit the sun in different speeds. The digfferent in the speeds are meant sometimes that we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Not a single spaceship has touched on Venus in more than three decades.

While also Venus is a challenging study for humans. Even more challenging for us is that the clouds of highly corrosive sulferic acid in the Venus's atmosphere. Also noteable just to let you know that Venus does have the highest temperature of any other planet in our solar system. Even tho there are some orther planets that are colser to the sun. Like Mercury it is closer to the sun more than Venus.

Astronomers are also so suprised. Because Venus has been that one planet that is most alike to Earth to our planet in the solar system. Astronomers say that "long time ago Venus was covered with largely oceans and could have supported various from our life, just like Earth." Until this day Venus has some features are analogous to those on Earth. Just like the planet surface as of the familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

Lastly Venus is the planet that is most likely to be like Earth. It has some features that are alike. Venus however would allow scientists to float above the fray. Venus is our sister planet that is so alike to Earth. Although Venus has a higher temperature than Earth.
