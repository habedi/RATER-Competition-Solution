I think that everyone should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it gives you a chance to see amazing things like different places and land forms that you may never be able to see unless you join. You also get to help other people and give them food and animals and shelters to help rebuild their homes and country. The program teaches you about other countries and their needs and going to expirence that in person helps you understand it more. You get to meet new people and have fun with them and do something great for their country at the same time. knowing that you are saving peoples lives is a great feeling and it lets you know that you have done something good in the world. The Seagoing Cowboy trip is a once in a life time chance to see amazing places and help people rebuild their countries and you get to help people and save lifes. I think that everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
