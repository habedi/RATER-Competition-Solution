In the American school system, summer break ranges from a period of about three months. During this break of three months, many students tend to forget what they have learned throughout the year. To combat this, many schools assign summer projects to make sure the students are actively learning during summer break. Many agree that these summer projects are an effective tool in maintaining an active learning sector for students during break, however there is controversy on whether these projects should be designed by teachers or students. Teacher-designed projects consist of a rubric with strict rules that students have to follow, where as student-designed projects leave more room for artistic freedom. Students should design their own summer projects because it allows for the best acquisition of learning by granting them with the freedom and independence they need to think creatively, demonstrate knowledge, and to be successful later on in life.

Summer projects should be student-designed because that allows for maximum creativity and limitless ideas. Teacher-designed rubrics can restrict a student's ideas, limiting their capacity to learn and perform. With the creative freedom provided by student-designed projects, students can generate novel ideas that cater to their needs and interests. Students can create a project that requires them to go beyond the academic circle by taking interest and actually applying themselves to real-world issues such as pollution or economic disparity. Without the restrictions of a rubric, students can do more than just write an essay or create a presentation. They can become an active part member of the community and make a real difference. This artistic freedom allows students to apply themselves in an engaging manner in way they actually care about, motivating them to perform better. Student-designed projects allow for the best acquisition of learning because it enables students to think creatively and generate a project they care about.

Another reason as to why summer projects should be designed by students is because it is fundamental to the learning process, because it is the final step in allowing students to independently acquire and demonstrate their knowledge. This concept is best illustrated through behavioral psychologist, Vygotsky's idea of The Zone of Proximal Development. The Zone of Proximal Development states that children learn a concept through steps that get closer and closer to performing the actual task and/or concept in hand. First students learn the concept visually and audibly by listening to the teacher's lecture and taking notes. Then they try and apply the concept themselves with the help of the teacher. Finally, students are able to perform the task themselves, showing that they have acquired an understanding of the concept. These summer projects work the same way. Throughout the year teachers assign projects giving students directions on what is expected of them. By summer time students have the skills necessary to design a project of their own that reflects the expectations of the teacher. Students then know how to learn and demonstrate a particular concept without the guidance of their teacher. This allows for the most efficient learning because it ensures that students actually know how to perform and demonstrate their knowledge without having to follow directions on a rubric.

Lastly, summer projects should be student designed because it allows them to be successful later on in life. The whole purpose or reasoning behind a project is to teach student how to present an explore a particular idea or concept. It is essential for students to learn and apply this skill independently as an adult. In the real world, there are no rubrics that direct someone in how to create an innovation or start a business. These are all skills that one must do independently, and student-designed projects serve as a great method in learning how to do so. Each summer a student can complete a project based on their own ideas and methodology. If students are always given a rubric and projects are always designed by teachers, they will never learn how to do this on their own. Student-designed summer projects gives students the opportunity to generate their own ideas early on, setting up a pass for their success later in life.

In conclusion, summer projects are best when designed by students because it allows for the best and most learning by engaging students to think creatively, demonstrate their knowledge independently, and setting up a path for their future success. The creative thinking fostered by student-designed projects allows for novel ideas and better performance. The independence provided by student-designed projects ensures that students know how to demonstrate such skills on their own. The ability to do so ensures success later on in life. These essential life skills are hindered when projects are designed by teachers instead of students. Allowing students to design their own projects ensures the most effective acquisition of knowledge.
