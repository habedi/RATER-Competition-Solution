Dear Principal:

I think that the policy should be that students should have to at least have a grade of B average. There are a few reasons that this should happen. One reason that people should have to have a grade B average is that students studies should definitely come first. Another reason is that it would encourage students to try to get there grades up higher and to not slack off in school. The last and final reason that students should at least have a B average in the school is that every person on the sports team would be smarter, which would possibly mean that the sports teams would become more about strategy than about brute strength, making the teams more deserving of what they earn and more enriching for themselves.

A persons studies should come before any sport. When a person gets good grades, that guarantees that they will at least get one spot in college some where which helps them get an advance in life. If a person were to rely on sports for their life, they are not guaranteed anything in the sports industry. Another thing is that if you are going to rely on sports, to get drafted into any sort of sports team, you need to be one of the best of the best on a college team. You cannot be the best of the best on a college team if you do not even go to college. Even if you get into a college, you have to have a 2.5 grade average to be drafted into any sport. Which is requiring slightly good grades.

Making it so that you can not get into any sports teams with out a B average is just more incentive fort the students to get higher grades and not slack off in any of their classes. Most people that play sports are very intelligent, they just choose in school, to only get the minimal requirement to play sports in their school because they do not want to do much work. Making it so that B is the minimal requirement will make it so all sports players that are only going for the minimal will be forced to get to that grade.

Every person n the sports teams would become smarter and the team would lean towards using their brain and not their brute strength so much. People would start to strategise and the sports teams would start to get better. Over all this is just a great decision for the school that will not only help the academic portion, but it will also help the athletes of the school. They will boost their grades and they would boost their ability to strategise, and there fore their ability to go further in life, and not just as an athlete.
