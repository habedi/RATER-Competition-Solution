Students have been required to do school projects to ensure they continue learning during the summer. Summer projects are implemented to help students prepare for the next school year. This helps to make sure that they are still learning even during their break. Summer projects should be student designed so that students can show what they're interested in, allows them to express themselves, and they each make their own mostly unique project.

First, a student that chooses what they want to do is most likely more interested in the assignment. They will show effort into not only making it an essay good enough to pass, but will also make it have their own unique flair to it. The project having just that bit more of a personal side would make students more willing to do their work. This also increase the student happiness because it isn't about something that they don't care about. The student will show that ,in this project regardless of how they do, will show that they are proud of the work they've done.

Secondly, student will be able to showcase their passion in an academic environment. They will be able to present their hobbies whether it is art, cooking, gaming, otaku related actives or history. They would be able to go in depth about this certain subject because of their own knowledge on the subject. It will help to also introduce a person and they are all about when the school year starts. It would help to reduce the first day awkwardness that students feel. A project that allows the student to demonstrate their passion would beneficial way for teacher for learn about their student.

Finally, the project is created based on their own goals for what they want to take away from it. The project is created from their own passion. The project has their mark of who they are showing their work ethic. It demonstrate without anyone pointing it out whether they work harder to things they care about or if they don't care about school in general. It also show they're current grade level if they meet the minimum standard, exceed it, or if they are going to need some help to reach their. Students will be able to not only express themselves with their own work ,but show another side that would most likely not be shown to the teacher.

While some may say that the teacher designed project would help keep students focus on their academic work, but a students passion isn't something that should be excluded. A student is more willing to work when they know their opinion matters. A student designed summer project is more likely to interest them reading several books that they don't care about.
