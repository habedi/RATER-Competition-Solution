Dear Principal

Deciding on whether you should want your student to perform community service should be your decision but you shouldn't force your students to do community service. I think that students should have a choice whether they should want to take community service or if they do not want to take community service. Making students do community service should not be the way to go as a Principal. I think that students should have a choice to choose community service because other students may want to do other activity', maby they would to try out other sports then to do community service. I think that you should let the students vote on whether they should all do community service or should they not be involve in community service. making a student do community service is like making them serve detention for weeks. If you make students do community service then most students would think that your wasting their time by making them pick up some body else trash. Make the choice that you think that's best fir all of your students!
