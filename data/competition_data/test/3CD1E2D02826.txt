What do you think about joining the seagoing cowboys programs? I think that you should join because 1 you get to help people, 2 you get to bring supplies and other thing to people in need, and 3 you can get experence of how it feels to be a helping hand.

first, in August 1945, they received their orders to report to new orleans. we arrived august 14 luke said the day the pacific war ended. their seamen's paper and boarded the ss charles w .wooster,headedfor greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oat to feed them.

also,it took about 2 weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and month to get to china caring for the animals kept luke busy feeding them and giving them water two or three times a day and also the stalls had to be clean.

last,luke had learned his experence from his auntie at a farm that he helped and he work hard to help and that help him now with his work of taking care of the horses and that really and a big effect on his work now.

That is why you should work at the seagoing cowboys.
