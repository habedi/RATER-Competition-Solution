Some schools should require summer projects. Only because it keeps the students still engaged with the things they have learned over the past year in school. When having a break for so long students tend to forget a lot of things they have learned such as math, history science and English. All subjects are important things that should not be forgotten. When kids are in school they normally get projects that are teacher designed. It would be nice for students to be able to designed things them self.

Being able to make your own project about anything you learned in school would be awesome. If the project was student designed then they should be guide lines. Such as turning in a paper on exactly what your project is about to get it approved by a former teacher. Only to make sure that they are not just doing a project that is about anything, other than school related topics. When having the opportunity to make up your own project, you should have so many new idea on how you wanted to due your past projects. When making a project in the summer you can go big or go home. If It is a science project you could build a huge blasting volcano. That shoots up a big ball of volcanic acid, that flows down and melts things.

When having a project that is designed by a teacher there is certain rules that you have to follow. Such as due dates,certain topics, and strict rules on how exactly the project needs to be done. Teachers give projects that are really harsh. There is most likely always a certain website or paper that is needs to be on. Not everyone wants to do projects the way teachers want them done. So, letting kids adventure out to do their own thing should be nice, as long as there are rules on what they are talking about. If the teachers could have one rule it should be having a project in every subject just to keep the information fresh in to there minds.

Summer is the time for fun, not to keep learning about things or trying to refresh your mind of certain topics that are in school. It is the time to relax and also not have to worry about when things need to be turned in or even the strict rules that teachers make students follow all year long. When in school students have to do so much homework, test and projects. So,having projects for all subjects or just one would be to much on the student. Kids during the school year struggle with these types of things. Students that have so much work in classes probably get really stressed, tired and maybe even depressed. Having a lot of work in school can put so much pressure on a person. So, having the little free time they can during the summer is great. So, what makes the school think that the kids want to still learn during the summer. That is the time to have fun with the family and not worry about school or anything else.

To come to a conclusion, projects should start happening at schools to make kids more involved with their school work and to stay focused. When keeping some of the information you learn, can actually help you remember things that you may need in the next class you are going to. So,when having a summer project there should be guidelines and certain topics. The project should be teacher and student designed. Only because there are thing that need to happen and not happen. So, at the end of the day the project is not inappropriate.
