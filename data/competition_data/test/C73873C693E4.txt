The Author supports the Idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because they call venus the " the Evening Star"

it is one of the brightest points of the light in the sky . but it is very misleading because venus is actually a planet and because each mission they have done was umanned and not successful.

In the Article it says that " on the planet's surface tempetures average over 800 degrees fahrenniet " which means it doesn't matter if it gets that hot in venus they are still willing to study venus. either ways saying in the article " Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though mercury is closer to the sun." there are some very good reasons on why scientists want to explore venus another reason why is because there is some stuff that are similar to the earth's surface saying in the article " Today Venus still has some feautures that analogus to those on earth the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valley's mountains and craters "

In conclusion the author supports the idea that studying venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers such as NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus.
