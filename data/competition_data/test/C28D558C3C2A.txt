Dear Principal,

I do not think that requiring community service for students is a good idea. First, this will take time away from homework, studying, and extracurricular activities. Second, some students are in more sports, clubs, and activities outside of school than others, and wouldn't have much time for extra community service on top of that. Lastly, clubs are made that require community service in some schools, instead of making everybody required. If you required community service at our school, it wouldn't be a smart idea.

First, requiring community service for students will take time away from their homework, studies, and activities outside of school. Any student who is struggling to stay on top of the work load would start receiving failing grades because they get less time to study for tests and finish homework. Students with other activities going on would be rushed and stressed, as opposed to if they chose to join a club or group of students who wanted to do the community service.

Second, some students have more work, activities, and sports after school than others. For example, if some students have multiple sports, harder classes, and jobs before and after school, then it isn't fair to require them to complete as much community service as other students who get off with easy classes, and no sports or clubs. This new rule would be unfair to certain students. Maybe a club that requires anyone who isn't already in a club or sport to join and do community service would be a better idea.

Finally, requiring community service for all students is a bad idea. This would take time away from homework, studying, and any clubs or sports the students participate in. It would be unfair to the students that are involved in many other activities, as well as the students who aren't in these activities. A club that students could join voluntarily would be a much smarter choice. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

A Student
