Cars have been around for over hundred years. They caused some good and bad things. People use cars daily to go places. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.

To begin with there will be less car emissions. Ever since the first car rolled off the assembly line they have been polluting the air. As seen here "[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter" (Duffer). From all the cars and trucks that Paris has, they have the most emissions in their air. Another example will be "Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France" (Duffer). From experance working on cars the diesel engine give off the most pollution out of all the vehicles on the roads today. Since the air in France was getting to bad they had to "Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at hme or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)" (Duffer). The smog got so bad in the air that France had to take a good amount of drivers off the roads to reduce their emissions so the smog will be reduced. As a result from parking those drivers "Almost 4,000 drivers were fined" (Duffer). Today, cars are assories and people need their cars to go to work and cannot blame those people for doing what they had to do. One last example is "If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment" (Rosenthal). Since people are using cars less the pollution in the air will decrease. The emissions had gotten to bad and its hurting our Earth.

Lastly is there will be less traffic on the streets. Lately people have not been getting their drivers license."A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009" (Rosenthal). The newer generation does not have the disire to drive and to work on cars like the generation before them. Another example is "As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent were sold" (Rosenthal). 70 percent is a high number of people and that is a lot of people that are not on the roads. Since those people are in Germany this is what happen in France "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France" (Duffer). That is a huge decrease in traffic there will be no problems getting anywhere on time. Another key example is "People park their cars in large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home" (Rosenthal). Since people do not have the money to pay for a parking spot they have to get rid of their cars and that will definatly clear up the roads. One last example is "Vauban's streets are completey 'car-free'- except the main drag to down town" (Rosenthal). Vauban's street are compleatly empty now hows that for no traffic.

In closing, cars have been around for a while now. They caused some problems and no problems. People use cars to go places daily. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.
