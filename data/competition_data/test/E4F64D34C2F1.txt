I believe that the use of the cell phone policy during lunch is a good idea. The kids need to use the cell phones for stuff like emergencies. The kids have already been caught before with cell phones. Why not give them a little freedom. We should be able to use cell phones as long as we don't use them in class. Teachers have caught students using them and it's never going to stop. You might as well do with the policy, because it's only going to be during lunch. If an emergency happened and a parent was trying to get to theirkid the phone would be off.

I have a better offer for you. We could just text. A phone ring could disturb people but if the phone was just on vibrate that would work better. Texting is a better way instead of hearing someone's ring tone. Cell phone privileges should be aloud in school's. They are a resourceful way to get information. Besides, it's just when we eat. The teachers shouldn't really care how we use a phone at lunch. Cell phones are used in everyday life and why not school.
