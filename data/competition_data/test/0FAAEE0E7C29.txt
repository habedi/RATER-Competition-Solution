There are alot of good advantages on limiting car usage and the limit on cars usage should be something enforced more often worldwide .Cars are helpful and very useful when it comes to transportation but cars can also be harmful to the earth. Cars are contributing to the pollution of the air and is one of the big reasons why the number of cars used in communities should be reduced.

There are many advantages on limiting car usage for examle if we start limiting the usage of cars there will be less worries about smog. According to the article "Paris bans driving due to smog","Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog...diesel was blamed ,diesel makes up sixty-seven percent of vehicles in france". This evidence proves that cars are harmful to the air and will eventually become a problem for the people. Bogota, Colombia has a program where people hiked, skated, biked, or took buses to get to and from work. According to the article car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota the goal of this program is to "promote alternative transportation and reduce smog".

Most people would probably say that there should be no limit on car usage because people are very dependent on cars for their transportation but are not aware of the pollution and dagers that cars bring to the community. according to the article "recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by".
