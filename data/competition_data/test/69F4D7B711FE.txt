Students should be given the opportunity to design their own summer projects because they would all learn from eachother while practicing teamwork, and this would allow them to choose a topic within their interest which would improve their performances and increase their effort towards the project.

For example, Once in my science class we were all given the opportunity to choose our own summer project topic as a class while doing our own research and designing our presentations. During the creating process, everyone reached out to eachother and used their personal skills and strengths to help one another and come together as a team. When it got to the time where we had to present at the, everyone's hard work and research, along with personal skill, we were able to do a great job by taking leadership and teaching each other new things without a teacher involved.

This shows that students can take leadership while working together without a teacher's ideas in the center of the project.

Students designing their own projects gives them the chance to choose a specific topic within their interests which would improve their performance and increase the amount of effort that they give towards the project.

For instance, while given the chance to choose my own topic during an individual project , I was able to focus more and put in more effort due to my motivation because I was able to do my project on the topic that I liked.

This proves that when students are given the chance to do something that they like and that interests them , their performance and effort may improve because it is the topic of their choice.

Some people say that teachers should design summer projects because they are more trustworthy and that students may just choose a topic that is easy and quick so that they can finish early.

However, they are wrong because teachers may choose a topic that students are not interested in and that the students may not understand, leaving more work to the teachers because they students may need extra assistance and may lack motivation.

For example, If a class is given a project on something they never learned in detail or showed interest in during class time and they have to research it over the summer, the class will not be motivated to put in much effort and will rely on the teacher for information, this will put more work on the teacher.

Giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects more frequently should be considered, to improve their motivation and effort and to help them learn teamwork from each other.
