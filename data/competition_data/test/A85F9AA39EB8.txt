Dear Principal,

All students should be required to perform community service . If they choose to help our community then great, but if they do not, they need to. It is important to help our community so that it is a clean environment for us to live. If they do not help then our community could get dirty and be a great place to live and play.

The kids that are helping the community now are doing a lot of work and need more help. There doing things like planting trees, picking up trash, and tutor kids and a whole lot of other services. These kids are very good citizens for helping and people thank them everyday including some students that do not help. The kids that do not help think that i takes up to much free time and they have better things to do. They really do not have better things to on the weekend, they go home and play video games the whole day. They do not even consider helping the community.

So I think that you should require students to perform community service for at least a couple of weeks, to get the other students to thing about helping for a change. If you require it may get more students and their parents to perform community service also. So inclusion, yes, you should make in required, to get the students to help their community.

Sincerely,
