Usuage of cars should be limited for many reasons.  Many people in different countries agree that cars should be either baned or not used as constantly.  Pollution, Economy, and people's health are all a factor to limiting car usuage.

In Vauban, Germany, people have given up their cars. There is a fee to park in Vauban which is a coast of $40,000.  No one is going to want to drive do to that outrageous price.  70 percent of the people living in Vauban doesnt own a car and, 57 percent sold their car once they moved there.  "'When I had a car i was always tense.  I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter".  This quote shows that cars just bring you done emotionly and you'll feel better with out one.  In Vauban, cars are causing 12 percent of greenhouse gases.  The percent of greenhouse gases are four times higher in the U.S do to car's gas emissions.

In Paris, there is a smog problem going on.  There is so much pollution in the air that there was a forced ban on driving.  If anyone was found driving they were fined $31.  4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars taken do to not wanting to pay the fine or being difficult.  Paris had the most smog out of the European country; in Paris there was 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114 and, London had 79.7.

Bogota, Colombia has an annual car-free day.  A day full of hiking, biking, skating and bus riding.  If found driving on the car-free day you are fined with $25.  "'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Plaza".  President Obama is getting envolved with the limiting car usuage aslo. His goal is to curb the greenhouse gas emissions.  There have been less cars bought and licenses given out as the years go by.  Lastly, there has been a 23 percent decrease in young peolple driving from the years 2001 to 2009.

These are some reasons why car usuage should be limited; and as you can see many countries are starting to make a difference.
