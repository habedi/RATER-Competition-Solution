Why Luke Thinks You Should Join The

Program

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowboys program. I mean,why wouldn't he,he had a great time there and he thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

Another example is in the last paragraph when he said that he was gretful for the opportunity to be a Seagoiong Cowboy. Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that he is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowboy and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

I have another piece of evidence since you still don't believe me. He also says that Luke also had fun on board. This piece of evidence just proves that he had a good time just being on the boat.

In conclusion, I truly think that in this passage he was trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program and Ithink that you should believe that to. I gave you my evidence and my reasoning why I think this and if you read my evidence you should to.
