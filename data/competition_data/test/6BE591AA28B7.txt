I think that the driverless cars that google has made today are enough to prove that they are a definite possability and that it has its positive and negative side. I think driverless cars are the way to go because, car accidents are a large cause of deaths in countries like the US where there are many. Diverless cars could potentialy cut that down if not eliminate it. The google cars have suppossedly driven more than half a million miles without a crash and are still out there, which is enough evidence to show that it could definately save lives.

Driverless cars must be the better way to go due to the fact that it eliminates many of the variables that make driving as humans, diffucult. It would take out the nessesity to sleep for the automated car and could run long distances without haveing to stop and rest, which would also be good for delivery companies to start taking advantage of. Computerized cars could even be programed to be able to comunicate with each other leading them to be able to sycronize their paths and speeds and reduce even more risk for everyone. Despite how the laws may look at it automated cars could be safer without a driver than with one. It would even use less fuel to operate, with an integrated efficency system. With the technology that is avalible it may even be possible to soon run a computerized car on solar power and take out the fueling proccess entirely.

Automated cars could also become so much more than just a vehicle, it will have lots of technology onboard as well as a powerful computer. Just the addition of the computer could provide many more possabilities and have many more powerful aplications than your tablets or your smart phones. These cars would also be a luxury I don't think these cars will be cheep but may become easier to obtain later on just as most technology.
