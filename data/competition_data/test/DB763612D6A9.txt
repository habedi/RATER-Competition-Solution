I am against the development of these cars because I do not think everyone should have them. These cars could be a great idea, but there are some things that could turn this good thing into a bad thing. There are people out there that mess these types of things up, there are safety concerns, and I just think this is unnecessary for some people.

There are a few reasons on how humans could turn this good idea bad. There are people that do drugs and alcohol and drive afterwards. These are the type of people that would mess this technology up. In the article it says how the BMW would need human control over the car sometimes and if there is a driver that is drunk, they cannot do a good job of control. I think there would be a lot more crashes with this. People could also fall asleep or get very distracted while sitting there waiting for their turn to drive.

One safety concern I have about this technology is what would happen if the robot car messed up. Technology is not perfect and has major issues. Although these cars would have some safety features, it can always mess up. The in-car system that has entertainment for the driver is also a distraction. Things happen in split seconds and this kind of system would leave the driver distrated and unaware of the things going on around them.

This technology is also unreasonable to me because the only reason i think someone should have this type of technology is if they are handicap and cannot drive. People that can drive should drive on their own, I see no point to having a computer driven car. It is something that is not needed and extremely lazy. I do not think anyomne needs a car to drive them around if they can do so themselves.

Overall I think this is a bad idea. There would be too many issues and people would take advantage of this. I think the more advanced you try to get in technology, the worse things will get because people can not handle themselves.
