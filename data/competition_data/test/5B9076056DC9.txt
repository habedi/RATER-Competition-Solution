Do you love going to foreign places, taking care of animals, making new friends, or just having fun? If you said yes to any of these things, then you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program. A Seagoing Cowboy is someone who takes care of horses, young cows, and mules while they are shipped over seas to places like Europe and China. You don't just have to take care of animals though.

On the trek over to Europe and back to America you never work all day and all night. You have shifts that you share with multiple other Seagoing Cowboys, and while you are on break, you can play games. To help pass time, we usually play baseball and volleyball games. We also host table-tennis tournaments. Some people even read, whittle, fence, and box. There is never a dull moment on board of our ship.

Once you unload the cattle, mules, and horses, you don't just go right back on the boat to America either. You can go and sightsee! I had the benefit of seeing the Acropolis in Greece, and got to ride a gondala in Venice, Italy. I got to do other things too such as take a tour of an exavated castle in Crete, and see the Panama Canal on my way to China!

On top of that, you become very close friends with the people on board of your boat. After all you are on the boat with them from a month to a little over two months. So, you guys will become great friends from playing baseball with them in your free time, or just because you have to share chores with them. Also, if you're an animal lover, you get to take care of the animals too!

Finally, a benefit of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is you learn a lot too. You learn how to brave the storm of the harsh sea and how to take care of other people in need. It made me more aware of other people's needs and how to take care of them when they need help. Therefore, if you want to have fun, love sightseeing and animals, and want to make new friends, then becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is for you. Come and join us!
