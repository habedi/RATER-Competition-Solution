Summer can be fun but education is still important. The projects that are givien over the summer should be designed by the students. The projects should be on topic and show that the students know the information. If the project shows that the student knows the material, it shoud'nt matter how it's designed.

Also, students like espress themselves. If they are given a project that does'nt let them show their creativity, it's less likely that they'll do it. And if they do the project it probably will not be their best work. Students also like their freedom. So if they feel like that has been taken away from them, that can affect the outcome of their work.

However, if the project is designed by the teacher, it can save time by eliminating the struggle of coming up with ideas for the project. But with students designing the project it's more likely they'll want to do it wich will get them a better grade.
