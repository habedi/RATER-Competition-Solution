Many people believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens. These people are called theorist. Theorist are people who give accusations without any supportive details. That is kind of what you are,just a everyday theorist who doesn't like to support their claims. Although that is what sets you theorist aside from us scientist. We actually support our theories,like the face on Mars.

When the first image of the "face on mars" was released in 1976 it became a pop icon. People believed it was alien made and think their is alien structures on the planet.

I'm here to tell you that is not true,as you may know the most recent pictures from 1998 and 2001 you may see the images a little clearer and you are able to see the surrounding ground of the''face'',so if their was any alien activity or any alien structures down thier im pretty sure we would see it. Although we do think it is a landform. It is just another martian mesa,which unsual shawdows were used to give it this illusion of a human like face.
