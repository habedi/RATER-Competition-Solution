To the principle

I have heard that you are considering to require all students to perform community service. To be honest I think it's a great idea. But some students don't think it will be. But there is a large variety of things you can do for community service. For example, there is cleaning up litter, tutoring, cleaning other peoples yard, and a whole bunch of stuff.

I think the one that is well liked by students is tutoring younger kids. It's actually a lot of fun! It actually makes you feel like you are a teacher. The younger kids will ask you a lot of questions about how to do their homework. But most of the time they catch on to it pretty quickly. Of course you will think that their stuff is easy. But remember, you more than likely had the same problems when you were their age. If students like tutoring other students, they will probably encourage other students to consider students for tutoring. Then maybe the principle will consider making it an elective for the school. Of course it won't be mandatory but it could be for students that enjoy tutoring younger students in a lower grade level. By my opinion, it's probably the most enjoyed by students than doing other stuff.

Most students enjoy cleaning up their environment. For example, they clean up litter, pick up after pets, and growing trees and planting flowers. Some students get straight to it right after school. But most of the time students do it on their free time. I say free time because they probably have electives after school or play sports. Most students play sports after school to get a scholarship for a college they want to attend. Their practice only lasts for an hour or two. The best thing about community service and playing sports is that you have a lot of time to clean up your environment. Instead of cleaning up the environment, kids like to plant flowers and trees. I say the easiest thing to grow is flowers. Trees take longer to grow a full height then flowers take a couple of days. Trees take months or years to grow! Besides flowers come in a variety and you can choose what you want to grow. Trees grow into whatever they want to.

The last thing kids might interested to is cleaning up neighbors yards. Some people pay the kid like 5 dollars but some people don't pay them at all. It doesn't really matter if you get paid or not. You are doing a nice thing for your neighbor. He or she should appreciate that. Sometimes you just have to mow the lawn or pick up trash. So it's not really that complicated to clean up someone's yard. Well i guess it depends on how big the lawn is. If it's huge, then it wouldn't be hard to pick up trash but if your mowing the lawn, it might take you some time to finish. But on a good note, you did something nice for someone. They probably can't do it because they could be injured or something.

Those are a couple of things you should consider doing for the school.
