In today's society pretty much, everyone has a smart device like a tablet or a computer or a phone. People mainly use their phone more than anything to do pretty much everything like look something up on google or play a game take a picture make calls for work or to meet up with a friend and update social status and most importantly texting. Texting is a problem with people especially with young people, they never look up so they might walk into a pole or something but when it comes to driving, not even the law can stop them from telling their friend that they are on I-85 30 minuets away and that accident usually doesn't look pretty. Some companies like apple have put a driving mode on all their devices to prevent any notifications from appearing, some car companies have made it to where you pair your phone to your car and you can use voice commands to send texts and make calls and change your song and that helps some people.

People who are addicted to their phone and cant put it down shouldn't be allowed on any big roads unless they can put it down because accidents can happen in a second or two and a humans reaction time is 0.25 seconds which if you don't have your phone you can turn the wheel out of the way or hit the brakes but it takes you a second to put down your phone and half a second to look up and process what is happening and in total that's 1.50 seconds which means you lost your time to react and you have hit something or another car. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries and 1 out of 4 of those accidents is caused by texting and driving. It is better to have your passenger do your texting for you or tell when to make your next right turn so you can look at the road ahead and stay clear of any accidents. Over all drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving, it would reduce the amount of accidents each year and make the roads safer for other people.
