Have you ever thought of the advantages of limiting your car usage? Do you even know what driving does to the enviroment? Limiting the amount of times you use your vehicle will reduce the pollution in the world.

To begin with, In 'Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog' by Robert Duffer, it is stated on lines 14-16 that "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog" explaining that without cars, the amount of "congestion" in other words pollution will decrease rapidly. The popular use of cars and motorcycles have forced France to ban driving to clear the smog in their city. Pollution in this city has obviously grown over the years, by reducing the use of these machines has helped the enviroment.

In Addition, 'Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky records that there is a day banning vehicle use as well know as the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, with an exception of buses and taxis. Selsky wrote "The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog." With this city of 7 million, the rate of pollution will decrease throughout the years, even with one out of 365 days of not driving.

Lastly, 'Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, It is explained that the "Residents of [Vauban,Germany] this upsca;e community are suburban pioneers...they have given up their cars." Rosenthal notes that many families are happier without vehicles.
