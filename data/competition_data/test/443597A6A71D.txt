Various schools have given students the opportunity to learn right from the comfort of their home. If you are given the ability to learn from your own house it can improve grades, give students the opportunity to try different things, and to be able to attend school if the student is chronically ill. Some may say that students can only learn in a school environment, which I disagree with. Schools offering these services to students will benefit many people at the time and in the future as well.

Many students struggle to strive in a school environment due to many outside components. I personally have struggled to come to school due to mental illness, drama with friends, bad teachers, and the list can go on. I am just one of the students that have struggled with this problem and I know many other people have as well. When you are focused on many outside problems it is difficult to grasp onto the task at hand, which is passing your classes. If students are given the opportunity to learn from their own house and not miss anything at school their grades would skyrocket up. Some students just need that extra push to be able to strive in school and require different outlets.

Students consider school being a job, you work for eight hours a day then you go home and work some more. Instead with online classes students are able to manage their time wisely and do fun activities that interest them. Students who go to school instead of doing online classes sometimes find it can be difficult to play a sport, spend time with friends, spend time with family, and then add homework and studying into that mix. Some students would benefit significantly from an online class, they would be able to go to school and do the hobbies they enjoy doing. The key role in an online class is having good time management and not procrastinating all of your due assignments until the last minute.

Some students have mental illnesses or physical illness that can deprive them of being able to go to school. I have experienced first hand how mental illness can make it extremely difficult to go to school and learn. I have missed weeks on end of school due to crippling anxiety and depression making it impossible for me to get out of bed or to drive to school. I would not be able to do homework, make up missing work, or play sports which deprived me of all my outlets. If I had online school at that time I would be beyond successful in my school work and my social life as well. Physical illness can also make it impossible for students to come to school and to be successful, but with online school you are able to go to class and learn the exact material you would be learning in a classroom.

Online class as an option is one of the best thing a school can do for students. It gives students the resources to be successful if that student or students is struggling. If you are given the opportunity to learn from your own house it can improve grades significantly, give students the opportunity to try different things and do the things they enjoy, and to be able to attend school if the student is struggling with sickness. When schools are able to advocate for students, it makes student life and education more enjoyable compared to sweeping mental illness and struggling with school under the rug.
