In 1976 NASA'S Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor had taken a picture of a face-like form on Mars.

The area that this was found in is common for having these types of forms.

This land form was found in Cydonia, a region on Mars.

This form on Mars is a natural land form, although many people thought it to be created by aliens.

This thought had sparked sudden interest into the people about Mars, when it was released to the public.

Scientists had further looked into it and found it was just a land form.

However, somone had still thought that this was created by extra terestrials because they knew it was winter in Cydonia, so it was cloudy.

They stated that they thought the clouds could have blocked off many features of this land form.

They also thought that if you had taken a clearer picture then you would see many other features explaining that another life form had created it.

The same picture was later on taken in 2001.

This picture had many more pixels to show an HD picture of the object.

This updated picture showed a much more smooth and almost dome-like formation instead of a face.

This led many scientists to believe that this is a natural land form.

Some of the rock's features still had resembled a little bit of a human face.

Before NASA could know for sure wether this was natural or not they made the face on Mars a priority to take more pictures and find where it is and when they did, they had found that yes, it was just simply a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA had seen a face on Mars and couldn't figure out what it was so they took more pictures as the technology advanced.

This allowed scientists to know for sure that this was a natural thing.

Many people are still convinced that this is an extra teresrial creation and thet Ancient Eqypt had truely been crated by these creatures considering the fact that this face looks like and ancient pharoa from around those exact times.
