Technology is constantly changing our world. There has been incredible things made. Driverless cars would be another big change that would greatly impact our lives. It could either positively or negatively change society. The passage talks about the pros and cons of driverless cars. But there are not many negative things about these cars. I believe that driverless cars would be a good thing for our society.

In the passage it says that driverless cars have not had any accidents or crashes while testing them for over half a million miles. This shows that these cars are safe and there are still being more improvements made to make the cars even more safe. It also talks about how these cars would save money which is a good thing for everyone because we could use the money for other important things. Personally, I am running late often which is not a very good thing but these cars could help anyone who is in a rush and needs more time to finish something because they would not be the ones driving. You would just need to be prepared to take control of the car at any time in case the car needs human skills to accomplish something. The cars can break, steer, and accelerate by themselves but they still need help from a human driver when it requires human skills. Which means you still have to be paying attention to the road which is really one of the only bad things about this car.

These cars are safe, save money, and help you finish things that needs to be done by giving you time in the car to do it. The cars would truly benefit you. Many companies have already started making them so why would we stop them. It is also not like someone is going to be in a driverless car tomorrow, it still needs time but when the time comes I think it will be great.
