Dear Principal,

Many students do not have a B average, instead many have a C average. They are trying very hard to reach that B, but sometimes it just doesn't work. Today I ask of you to at least let those with a high C average, 75+, allow to do these sports or other activities. If you do this, the liability that the students will try harder to at least reach that 75 will be higher.

They will try their best in every way, and you will have less people failing classes, maybe. Plus, there are classes that are difficult to do. Everyone has a strong point in a subject, and their weak point. For example, some one can be really good at math, but in science they are struggling, and already having a tutor trying to help them, but sometimes a tutor just can't help them. We try hard, we some times fail, but were at least trying.

You know how their is always that one child in every class that will always be the bad one. When I say bad, I mean the one kid that always goofing off, making funny jokes, and disturbing everyone. Wells their are several reasons for why that person does that. One reason, their just not good at that subject, and so they don't care what they get, and start to goof around.

Grades are the scariest thing to get. Especially when you have a specific grade to reach. Some parents will get mad, if their child has a C, and they would just push that child, telling him or her all these great things that could happen if they have an A or B, or they will tell their kid about how they were in the past. Then when a child gets an F, the parents become more pushy, they don't meant it, but they just want their kid to have a better future. Since this is happening children have only been struggling, because their constantly being pushed to do something better when they really don't want to. They are not relaxing enough. They are not having time to themselves to enjoy their own life, instead they are cramming their nose in a schools book reading. I'm not saying that shouldn't read, but it should really be just for a short time, like 10 minutes.

I ask of you to at least let those with a high C or above be able to participate in sports or other activities. Well at least try to do it this way, and if it doesn't help at the end of the year then you can go back to doing the B average. Just remember to consider how other students are. Watch them through the hall, listen to them, and see what they are doing. Adults can learn a lot from a kid if they actually payed attention and viewed everything the way the child is does.

Sincerely,

A fellow student
