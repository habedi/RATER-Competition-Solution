When people come to school its for to learn not to be forced into any activites. Some people may like to join extracurricular activites , but do i disagree or agree? i disagree.

The principal run the school but he shoudnÂ´t make joining a activity a priority. ItÂ´s more than life than just school to me. We are in school for eight hours straight no talking, no playing, no phone just more and more work. Teachers think itÂ´s easy coming to school for eight hours straight following all these rules. There are rules everywhere u go but in school itÂ´s rules that teachers and staff know they wouldnÂ´t be able to follow. They still put pressure teens most students not even teens yet. They want us to come to school for eight ours straight wake up at 6 in the morning come to school be quiet sit up and write in a hard chair all day be quiet to your spoken to by a staff or teacher. IÂ´m not built to be bossed around basically that is what school is you got sumbody thats not your even your parents telling you what u can n canÂ´t do every 5 seconds like u a a slave or something. I thought that was over years ago well thats wat i learned in school. ItÂ´s not that I donÂ´t appreciate help I do but, everytime you dont follow directions or miss a day of school everybody make it seem like u a clown or a dummy because you dont wanna be here in school learning some things you dont even need in life. Some teachers and staff in this building are not even here cause they care and wanna help. Most teachers and staff are here for the money and to help they self.

I donÂ´t depend on these teachers to help me better myself so many days of school cause my pride and it be alot going through my head.

Then itÂ´s like if you in activites after school you can be kicked out for anything u do.

We kids we make the most mistakes in life especially when you this young. If you dont follow directions or your grades slippin they say and do anything to get you to listen to them and follow what they are say. Soon as a athelete mess up these teachers and staff use that against them tryna take something away they know we love doing like basketball,football,soccer,hockey,golf and tennis it just seem like all that is on the line when your not in school listening to what the people in the school are telling you to do.

I am strongly disagreeing with the decision the principal made. Because I dont know what is going on with my family why i am at school joining activites. My life different from all these other kids and most likely hard thatÂ´s why i wouldnÂ´t consider joining no activites right now. I wouldnÂ´t want to waist nobody time tryna help me cause its guranteed im not going to make it everyday i dont even make it to school everyday. School, teachers and staffs taught me alot, but somethings i had to find out the hard way. Everything i just typed is why i disagree with that decision.
