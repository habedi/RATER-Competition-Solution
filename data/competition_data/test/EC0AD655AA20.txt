dear, principal

I would like to say that the knew policy is outrages because almost every student in the school has a C or lower. and most play sports, including me and I have one C. with being on the football team all my tame mates want that new rule changed. less and less kids will go to school. more and more will be home schooled and our athletic coaches wont be getting paid a dime. your school might have the chance to be shut down also for kids not coming. and all the students would loose there activities like TSA, honor society, party's, JV sports teams, reading clubs. and other fun activities. parents too will be angry at you for doing this. if you are not pleased with the students grades to make them quite all these things. start a after school program and involves fun activities while students learn. and if you do this the students will talk poorly about you and all the staff. and be even worst then before. so please do not make this new policy because you will regret doing it and putting this school through it. so if you don't just make a new program and that's the best thing i can think of.
