Dear Principle such and such,

It has come to my notice that you are considering that all kids who go to school should have to do community service and I strongly disagree because it should be a volunteer thing if you want to do it or not .Some kids don't want to do it and it would just make them angry if they had to miss a day off school to do work or leave there friends early to go clean up some street they would refuse to do it and take punishment rather then clean up the environment.

But I'm not saying you should not do it but make it a volunteer thing were you are committing to it and have to show up unless prearranged with you or who ever is in charge of it.

All I'm doing is voicing y opinion with you and getting my advice on the matter of what you are thinking of.

thank you, inmate 123
