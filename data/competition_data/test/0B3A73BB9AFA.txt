The "Face" on mars was not created bye Alians. The face on mars is just a natural landingform, and was not reayed by Alians. April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Sureveyor flew over cydonia for the first time Michael Malin and is MOC tean snaped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photo. After that thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appere, when finally when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natrual landing form. There was no Alian monument after all.

If the "face" was created by an Alian/Anlians there would be trakings of them and all that and it was really hard to see because it was winter at the time. They dont pass the unknown figure very offten, but when they did they payed really close attintion to the figure. They took more pictures to discover them. They still found know tracings or sighs that alians made this.

What the picture really showes is the Martiam equivalent of a butte or mesa- landingforms common around American West. "Its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight and the Face on Mars."
