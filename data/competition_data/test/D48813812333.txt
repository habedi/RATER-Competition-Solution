DEAR TEACHER_NAME

MY POSITIONING ON COMMUNITY SERVICE IS THIS: WOULD YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WE MAY HAVE TO INHABIT ANOTHER PLANET BECAUSE OUR OWN PLANET IS FILLED WITH LITTER? THIS COULD HAPPEN, AND YES, IT MIGHT MAKE THIS SEEM MISLEADING, BUT THATS NOT THE POINT. WE SHOULDNT BE FORCED TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE. PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WORK IN COMMUNITY SERVICE FIGHT FOR

THEIR CAUSE, AN OTHER SUPPORTERS CAN STAND UP AND HELP. FORCING SOMEONE TO HELP

A CAUSE SHOULD BE AGINST THE CONSTITUTION. IF YOU WISH NOT TO FOLLOW, YOU DONT SHOULDNT HAVE TO. FORCING PEOPLE TO FIGHT AGINST A CAUSE THEY DONT WANT TO IS TAKING AWAY THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE, WHICH SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED. BUT, AS IN A CASE SUCH AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN SENTANCED BY A JUDGE TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR DAMAGE TO THE COMMUNITY, I CAN NOT SAY THAT IS WRONG. BUT EVEN THOUGH I SEE IT AS A BAD IDEA TO FORCE SOMEONE TO DO IT, I DIDNT SAY IT SHOULDNT BE A CLASS OF SOME SORT, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU CAN GET CREDITS FOR HELPING PICK UP TRASH, OR HELP KIDS IN ELEMENTARY WITH WORK OF SOME SORT. IN

MIDDLE SCHOOL, WE COULD GET EXTRA CREDIT FOR ONE CLASS BY DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE. THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT SOLUTION, MORE PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO HELP, THROUGHOUT SCHOOLS. WE COULD AVOID THE FUTURE OF HAVING TO INHABIT ANOTHER PLANET, BUT WITHOUT FORCING PEOPLE TO HELP. THATS MY POINT. WE CAN DO EVERYTHING EFFICIANTLY, AND DO IT PEACEFULLY, AT THE SAME TIME. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS POSSIBILITY

SINCERELY, STUDENT_NAME
