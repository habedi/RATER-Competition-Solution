"Yes I agree that it would be amazing to have life on Mars, but theres just simply no evidence to support your claim." I argue. Most people think there is life on Mars but I disagree. I think this because, there is no evidence, there are things on Earth that look like faces but are not, and we have digitaly made the picture 3 times bigger and found nothing.

First of all I think this because, there is no evidence. No evidence has been found to suggust that there were aliens who built the face. The only thing you can find on aliens are in newspapers or on tv and they are based on pure opions instead of facts.

Secondly I think this because there are things on earth that may look like a face but isnt one. There are many landforms that may resembel a face but were proven to be naturaly formed.

Lastly, I think this because we have digitaly made the image 3 times bigger and found no objects in the picture. So if there were objects in the picture we would have been able to see them. This supports the idea that ther is no life on Mars to create the face.

This all supports the idea that aliens did not create the face on Mars. I belive that the face was created by natural elements and just happens to look like a face.
