In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours an average of 660,000 people are using electronic devices while driving. People from ages 16-24 are mostly involved in car accidents having to do with texting and driving.

When you text and drive you put not only your life at risk, but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.

Texting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing a death. When you text and drive you are distracted and are not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving is bad and also illegal.

Additionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.

In conclusion, texting and driving does not need to occur. do not do anything else in your car besides paying attention to the road and having both of your hands on the steering wheel. People around the world need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in. too many people di because others are too worried about their phones instead of the people around them.
