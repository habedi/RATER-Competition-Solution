The idea of sending humas to another country in space has been a livley debate for many years now. Following the US putting the man on the moon the idea has grown and sicentificly become thought of as more attaniable. But, before sending any human life form to another planet it is important to conduct the proper scientific tests and research to see what the outme of such an expiremt may hold. The passage "The Challenge Of Exploring Venus" presents strong evidence to prove that sudying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the potential dangers.

The artilce states that venus is the closest planet to earth. This would lend itself to being an easier task to study. Studys have already shown that the thick atmoshere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. This allows the conclusion to be drawn that extra saftey measurs would need to be taken in the expiremental stage of the project.

With such harsh conditions that are ever so hazerdous the quester arises 'why study venus?'. The text gives prime ezxamples to why we should indeed study venus. Venus is the planet that is most earthlike. It has rocky sediment, valleys,mountans,and craters. Features like this present the most likey chance of surviving an expedition to study the plannet as the author claims it should be done.

With a world full of fast pace ever changing technology it is important that scientifical innovative leaps be taken to 'keep up". With such a hefy task such as studying a potential non earthly inbabital plannet it is importand thourough steps be taken in research,planning,simulation of the conditions and reflection be taken before plans for a real expdition begin being formed. There is true value in studying beings,concepts,terrain, and values that escape the bound of plannet earth. The studying of venus is simply a step in the right direction.
