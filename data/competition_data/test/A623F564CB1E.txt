The topic of distance learning is subject to a heated debate. The winner will decide the future of the world and its inhabitants. As the world moves into the future, the people will need to move with it. While some people may say that distance learning is going to weaken the productivity of future generations, distance learning will actually make future generations more productive, eliminate the classroom disorder that comes with attending school in person, and move the world as a whole forward.

The schools in places that have already implemented distance learning have made their students more productive. In Europe, countries such as Switzerland have a general happiness rate of 90% versus the US, which has a general happiness rate of 72%. School takes up 7 hours, a good portion of a regular person's day. Without that 7 hours spent in a classroom, students have more time to get tasks done. The more time to get tasks done, the more their productivity increases and their contributions to society as a whole increase. Students in these places have been inventing potential cures for diseases that have been incurable since the birth of the human race. Having this time would allow people to fix the world's problems, such as world hunger, war, and mass genocides.

Not only does distance learning increase productivity, but it decreases the teacher and student mayhem in classrooms. According to Professor Generic_Name, a college professor at the University of Virginia, "I love most of my students, but some of them are just so chaotic, they disrupt the learning experience of everyone else." As he said, some students are so unruly that they turn a classroom into their personal chaos playground. Distance learning would make it so that everyone could learn without needless distractions of others not wanting to learn. Having teachers who teach different ways is much appreciated, except for when they don't teach. Students all over the United States claim to have at least one teacher in their schedule who doesn't actually teach the material. A teacher at Generic_School, Generic_Name, gives students work and then looks at her phone the rest of the class, although she is helpful if you ask her. The separation of students from the physical school would give teachers like these who are actually helpful when you ask them by themselves the opportunity to truly teach the material to their students.

As these teachers have received this opportunity, the world is moving forward; distance learning will help move the world forward together. As UN president Generic_Name said" The world is more united because of technology." As we improve technology such as would allow for distance learning, world peace becomes a distinct possibility. News spread across the world in an instant, anyone can talk to anyone anywhere, and different communities can share their ideas. Distance learning, by separating us from school, would put us in touch with the world. This could be opportunities to enjoy nature, talk to somebody from another part of the world, and much more. According to Professor Generic_Name of the College of Indiana, "Distance learning is the further development of technology, and of that our unification." As technology develops, the world will be able to work together more. The world will move into the future and solve its problems together as a whole, instead of a bunch of separate countries.

The world that is moving into the future must look into its past and question, 'How can we be more productive, have less disorder in the classroom, and unite?' This, distance learning, is the answer. Distance learning is not just a question of where classes take place, but of our future. The path to unity is through distance learning. The world is going through some trying times as of right now, so uniting is the only option for the survival of the plantet and the human race.Â
