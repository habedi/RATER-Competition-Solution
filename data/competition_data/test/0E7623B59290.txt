Have you ever wondered what other people might be feeling? Well the aruthor in the store is introducing us to this new technology called The

Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This Technology is suppose to detect anyones emotions at that time by using a 3-D model of a face and detects it by the 44 major muscles must move like human muscles.

I believe this could be a good use for in the future for students in school who deals with depression and anxiety and doesn't show it. Some students probably wont't like the idea of a computer telling how you're really feeling because like some they probably doesn't like to show any emotions but this technology could help a lot of students out dealing with their emotions.

It would be just like us telling a friend how are they feelings just like in the article its says For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelin simply by the look on her face".

We all need just a reminder to smile every once and a while just like in the article it also says helps the muscles and helps preduce them.

Overall, i think this technology could be very usefull not only to just express feelings but also for students, adults, anyone who deals with their emotions to helps them. Make them feel happy and be able to show their emotions intead of keeping it inside of them.
