Dear Principal,

I agree with you i think making people do community service is good one example is because it would help our community a lot and it would be healthy. it would also keep people from doing bad things and more people would stop littering so other people won't have to pick their stuff they throw on the ground and people would also stop being lazy. People won't have to pick others up if you just throw your stuff in the trash and don't litter then people won't have to do community service so it's better to make people do community service till people will stop littering and being more responsible. People would also have more time if others stop littering and they would do what they want so they won't have to pick others trash up and have to throw it away for them. People would also be more kind to each other , children would stop doing it because if they litter they would have to do community service so they would get used to it and then they would stop littering. It's a good item to require community service and if you do require for students to do community service the community would be much better and more people would feel safe to be outside.
