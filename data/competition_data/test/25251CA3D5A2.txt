Cars they've become a major part of our society. However ask yourself this, do we really need to use them for everything? What if we could seperate from the everyday life of using cars. People around the world are trying to change their lives by making cities and suburbs more dense and easier for walking. Imagine a world where we walk to work with our neighbors and hear bikes going down the roads and children off exploring their home together and not a car in sight. Does it seem to good to be true? Most likely it is right now. Humanity is stubborn espcially the Untied StatesÂ  because we refuse to change our way of life. Cars are one of them and they're kind of a problem right now.

Passenger cars make up 12 percent of greenhouse gases in Europe however they make up almost 50 percent in places such as the United States. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities. We could have communities that have almost no cars in sight and instead of driving to get groceries or something else we need we could walk just a little to the shop right down the road. This could lower air pollution by big amounts and people could finally get some excercise they need instead of sitting behind a desk all day.

America's love affair with its vehicles seeems to be cooling. It seems as if America is finally slowing down with driving and owning cars. We started to decline in greenhouse gases but it seems as if that was only temporary. America is still too attached to cars.

The world where theres no cars and people walk and talk together is a long time away. It seems as though cars will be a part of our society for a long time coming and theres nothing really about to change. However that perfect world is developing slowly in countries such as Europe and some of America, but its not perfect yet.
