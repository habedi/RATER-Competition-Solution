I believe policy 1 is better because some students will use it at free time and lunch period and wont have to use it in class. I also think policy 1 is better because if they had policy 2 then some students will still bring there cell phones to school no matter what because they cant use it during free time. Which policy is better? Policy 1 where the students will use it during free time and lunch period and put them away during class or policy 2 where you wont allow them to bring there cell phones and they wont listen and still bring them and use them during class? That's why i think policy 1 is better. But i also think policy 2 is better because if students have a chance to bring there cell phones to school and use then during free time and lunch time, they might also take advantage of it and use them during class time to text other students. I also think policy 2 is a good choice because it will disturb there learning/academic's time and wont get anything done. Some people will also on MCAS text each other the answers or use the calculator's on there cell phone's. That's why i also think policy 2 is also a good choice.
