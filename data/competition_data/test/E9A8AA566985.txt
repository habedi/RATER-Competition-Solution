Summer projects should be teacher-designed. The purpose of summer break is to relax and take minds off of school. There is no need for a summer project, however, if a school feels it's necessary to keep learning over break then students should not have to spend time designing it. The summer project should be teacher-designed because teachers are supposed to guide the learning process of students, teachers can tailor the rubric towards their guidelines, and to make it more likely for students to complete the assignment.

Teachers know how a student thinks. The point of a teacher is to guide a student's learning and make sure that the student has a firm grasp on the material. The project can serve as the medium of laying down a foundation for a class that the student will be taking during the following school year. The teacher can design the project so that the student learns the subject in a chronological order as they go through the project.

A teacher who designs the summer project would also know what to expect out of it. The teacher can set guidelines in order to somewhat envision what the final product will look like. When creating the rubric for the summer project, the teacher can base it off of the guidelines they set. It makes it easier for a teacher to grade; when they control variables such as guidelines and how to grade based on those guidelines.

No student wants to design their own project, especially during summer break. By having a teacher design it, the student doesn't have to spend as much of their summer break focusing on the summer project. This gives the student more motivation to actually complete the assignment. Less time spent on the summer project leads to more time to relax. This way the student can go back to school refreshed and ready to produce higher quality pieces of work.

Teachers may argue that students become more creative when they design the summer project, however, the cost of the student being more creative is that the student would get less time off from assignments. The break from school and assignments is vital for students' mental and social health, which both contribute to learning. A teacher-designed summer project gives more benefits than a student-designed summer project. The summer project should be teacher-designed because it may help the student understand the material better, it allows the teachers to make the rubric more precise, and it cuts out work for students.
