Cellphones and Driving

In 2015, 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers on U.S. roads. 9 people in the U.S. are killed each day because of crashes involving distracted drivers. When will it end? Cellphones should not be used when driving.

Did you know that texting and driving is more dangerous than driving under the influence? Studies show that using a cell phone to read or send text messages delays driver's reaction time as much or more than the legal limit of alcohol consumption. Distracted driving has been called "An epidemic in the U.S. that can be completely prevented".

I completely agree with them because texting and driving didn't always used to be a problem. Now everybody thinks they can check Instagram or Snapchat while driving themselves or their friends to the park or movies, then they get into a car crash. It only takes three seconds after a driver's attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur. All they had to do was turn their phone off or put it in the glove box of the car, And the potentially fatal crash could have been avoided.

So if your one of the 77% of adults that think they can text and drive your wrong. Things can take a literal turn for the worse in less than three seconds.

And if your one of the 55% of teens that think that, just think you have your whole life ahead of you don't ruin it over a Snapchat post, or don't get one of your friends killed because you text and drive. Just try to imagine if your friend died and it was your fault. How could you live with yourself. So do the nation a good deed and stop distracted driving.
