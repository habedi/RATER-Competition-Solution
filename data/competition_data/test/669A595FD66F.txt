Researchers say, if people take a few month break from something, they will most likely forget it and will have to relearn it. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. People debate on whether the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would allow the student to be more creative, do a project they would enjoy, and gives students more independence.

If students were to be required to make a summer project and it was student-designed, it would let students be more creative. Most teachers and parents want their student/child to think outside the box. A student led project would make students use their brain more, during their 2 month long break of not doing anything. The project would allow students to develop an independent mind. They would give a nudge for students to get out of their comfort zone. The project would make students think more independently at a younger age. As they get older, they will be more inclined to do things out of their comfort zone. Supporting a student to lead his summer project would make the next generation more creative.

A student led summer project would allow students to pick a topic they would enjoy. Majority of people will produce quality work if they have a passion for it. People like to work on projects they enjoy and can open their minds to. If someone likes a subject they will most likely want to pursue that subject. Some students will find the topics a teacher gives them boring and unmotivating. This is due to the fact that one person cannot satisfy everyone in the room. If a student doesn't like a topic they will not enjoy it and it will not accurately represent their academic skills. Allowing students to lead their own summer projects, means they will pick something they will enjoy and have a passion for.

Doing a student led summer project would give students more independence. Students would have to take more responsibility. If a student were to do bad on a project they would have to take responsibility for their actions. It would train the next generation to take responsibility instead of blaming someone else. This would give students more preparation for the adult life. They school system gives little to no preparation on how to manage an adult life, but it would give students a little more experience for the students. A project like this would give people a little nudge to grow up gradually. Summer projects would give more independence, if it was student led.

Student led summer projects would, overall, allow students to be more creative, do something they enjoy, and give students more independence. The projects would mold students to take responsibility, think outside the box, and pursue something they enjoy and have a passion for. Summer projects should be student-designed so they can continue learning over the summer break.
