Dear TEACHER_NAME,

You have to make a decision on whether or not to make all of the students perform community service let me tell you my point of view. I strongly encourage you to have all the students perform community service for various reasons. The first reason is that some places desperately need help from young willing students. Also, this will help better prepare students for work in the future. Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach students responsibility. Now, ponder my reasoning and read about all of my various ideas about this subject.

First and foremost, community service is a great way for low income and rundown places to get help from young willing students. They are strong and able to help for long periods of time. Some places, like community shelters, desperately need help because they are financially instable and they don't have enough money to hire help. This will give them more help and they will get things done faster. Also, this will save them a lot of money because they wouldn't have to hire anyone new. The work would get done, but at a faster and more affordable rate, not to mention that they will be very grateful.

To add to my reasoning, this experience will better help a multitude of students gain insight into what its like to work. People spend more time working then anything else and this experience will help them prepare for that. They will know what it is like to commit to a job. They will have to work to either get enough volunteer hours or get a good grade. They will have to help the best they can and give one hundred percent of their efforts in order to do well and gain the respect of who they are volunteering for. This is vital for a good relationship and for an overall good grade. This will help them prepare for what its like to work in the real world. They even may find what job they really want to do by volunteering or volunteer where they want to work.

Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach the students responsibility. Now a days students are lazy and just watch television or play video games all the time. This will make them strive for some thing better with their life. It will teach them what it means to work hard and to be dedicated. In this generation, the work ethic is at a minimum and we are just downright lazy. This might make kids want to get up and work if they find a job or volunteering center that really interests them. They will eventually want to get up and go do their community service without being asked or told. They may even make a bond with whom they are volunteering for and they may make a friendship for life.

In summation, volunteering is very beneficial for various reasons. First of all, volunteering helps places that are in need of workers and a helping hand. Also, this experience will help better prepare students when they get jobs in the future. Finally, volunteering will give the students responsibility. These are very excellent points that I know you will carefully consider and ponder, because that is the right thing to do. This is really what volunteering is about, not the material things you do, but how you change while doing them.

Your student,
