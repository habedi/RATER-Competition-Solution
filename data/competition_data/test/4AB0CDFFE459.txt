Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that if you change the school policy to where students must have a grade

B average and the majority of Students have a grade C average there might not be a sports team of any kind. There are a few students that have A' s and B' s but a few is not enough to make up a full football team or basketball team so if you change that policy you would be taking away that joy of our team winning a basket ball game or foot ball game. Sure athletes could play outside of school but then there would be no reason for winning because it doesn't go towards a reputation or anything. I think that many other kids would agree with my side of this argument because its something that we can all do with friends and meet other people from other schools. Please consider keeping the schools policy the way it is and by that keeping all of SCHOOL_NAME happy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
