People in this day in age rely on using cars to get around. Some people dont have cars to get around so they use other resources like cars or buses .but truth be told not using a car is really effective way to save our natural resources . In vauban,germany only the upscale suburban pioneers , soccer moms and commuting executives had cars and so have a car to a lower classmen was just stressful to them."

70 percent of vaubans's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to here." when i had a car i was always tense . I'm much happier this way ," said heidrm walter , a media trainer and mother of two

" (rosenthal pargraph 3).

In 2006 vauban completed a growing trend,the united states to separate suburban auto use .that was called "smart planning". smart planning became effective and it started to happen . The upper class had a advantage ..money. the upper class got to have a nice cars because they had more money thena middle calss so this was good because that meant less wealth and so less cars then less polution and save natural resources .

"

all of our development since wolrd war 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"said david goldberg, an official of transportation for america

"(Rosenthal paragraph 7). american government is trying to make cars now so safe and afficient . there making cars that are electric to try not to use so much gas and start saving energy#the2k15resolution.

"

Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. diesels make up 67% of vehicles in france, compared to a 53.3 % avereage  of diesels engines in the rest of the western europe, according to reuters ." (duffer 16) diesel fuels arre less used than gasoline so people really have no use in trying to turn  big trucks electric because there is on alternative for diesel gas .

In conclusion,cars are less effiective to earth . so by wlaking or using gass less there is less polution and a good natural resource that we have .using diesuel gas is another efective way to use gas and cars wisely.
