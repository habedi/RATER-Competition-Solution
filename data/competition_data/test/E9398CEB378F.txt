Student Emotion Reading Argument

Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam study better ways to find out human emotions faster. These two Professeor's have created a computer that makes a 3D model of your face and it calculates your emotion by the way your facial muscles are being used. Many people are asking "could this kind of technology be valuable in schools for students".

The use of this technology should not be allowed in schools class rooms. Thats not the teachers buisness wheather an student is feel happy, surprised, fearful, angry, or sad. If the student wants someone to know how they are feeling they can go to the teacher and tell them. They could even go to the gidance counselor, or the priciple. Basically I am saying that i student show be able to expresss their feelings if they want to without everyone knowing.

Then this kinda has an up side to if this kind aof technology was in schools. Teachers could help student more if they are angry, or sad. Therefor I kinda see why the question is "should this kind of technology be in classrooms?".

In conclusion i feel that this kind of technology should not be in classrooms. If it is in classrooms for the school to use it on a child they should have parent parmission. Also notify the parent that they are gonna use it before doing so.
