The foundation of a summer project is very important, as it introduces past topics for a student over break to evaluate once attained. When deciding whether a teacher or a student should design the summer project, i believe it is best for a teacher to create the summer project. The reason i choose for the project to based off a teacher was due to the teacher being professional,experienced, and for their effort.

Given the fact that teachers are professionally trained to educate, it helps establish the projects legitimacy and create's a sense that the project is resourceful. Also teachers have been taught how to teach at colleges and are certified to be apart of the educational system. Their number of years teaching adds on to their own experience and would help show how well they are at educating students. Because teachers teach for a living, it induces a feeling that a teacher does their job with all the effort they can put and prove that they are reliable to teach youth effortless. Being a professional helps a lot with any task, like a mechanic repairing a car who can fix it expertly, while a business man who has not much knowledge in the field of auto repair.

The effort teachers put in their work is amazing, as it helps the students understand and learn the subject more easily. Every teacher is different in a way, and their difference helps implement certain techniques to teach students a topic. A teachers skill can vary in multiple ways, and this helps their teaching ability, which also affects how a student learns. Depending on how much effort one teacher puts into his or her job may also determine how resourceful they are in helping a student learn, so that all students can rely on their teacher for help when it is needed. When someone puts effort into anything they desire, what comes out from that hard work is success and when teachers devote effort they only help each student succeed in learning.

When it comes to learning, a teacher is best related to that subject and are best known for the experience they have. Being in the educational system helps the teachers show the students they are not new to teaching and experienced in the education stage. While being in the education system so long they have gotten used to their own way of teaching. Because of how experienced a teacher can be, they can encourage students better and work harder, so they know how to help any and all students to strive better. A good example of this would be a officer in the army, who is experienced and can encourage and make a good example of himself to help his recruits strive and work better.

All these reasons help prove how much it would benefit if it were a teacher who is a professionally trained, greatly experienced, and most importantly, puts in the effort needed to help his or her students succeed. And the summer project would be absolute perfection if made by a teacher.
