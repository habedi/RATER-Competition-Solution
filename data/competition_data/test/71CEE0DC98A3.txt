Online video conferencing in order to attend a class from anywhere can be very beneficial.

As we get older and technology becomes better and better, this is an easy task to execute.

All you need is two devices that can pair together.

As long as students are using their emails to communicate and their phone number isn't easily displayed than this is a resource that is very beneficial.

Video conferencing in classrooms are the future because, if a student gets sick, student gets suspended, and as long as it isn't full time, than it will change the way we educate children.

Everyone gets sick and has to miss school a couple days in the year; some more than others.

On those sick days kids just basically lay in bed all day and watch TV.

If they were able to watch a video of the classroom instead, the kid wouldn't have to worry about missing anything important.

Students come to school sick all the time for important college classes or fear of missing out, and thats how diseases spread.

If video conferences were an everyday thing than it would reduce the amount of people getting sick all over the world and especially make our classrooms safer.

Kids make bad decisions that dictate weather they will be attending school for the next couple of days, or even weeks.

Instead of a suspension being free time for them were they can do whatever they want, have them come to school over video conference.

It makes the suspension worth while.

Everyone can gain from it.

Students would be more inclined to follow the rules if they knew they would have to sit in front of a computer all day for their classes when they violate the rules.

All of this sounds good and beneficial but students will over use this or even not come to school at all.

Although this is an amazing resource, it is proven that face to face real life teachers are more effective.

If a student stayed home and did these video classes all year he/she wouldn't be retaining the information as well as the other kids. He/she will also be missing out on one of the most important factors of school, which is the social aspect.

Kids staying at home everyday wouldn't have to talk to any of their peers and learn how to developÂ relationships.

This will hurt them in the future and in the workforce when they have to work with other individuals.

Online video conferencing is a resource that must be used but their needs to be limitations.

If the correct limitations are applied than this concept could change the way kids learn for the better.

Especially now a days where mental health issues are at an all time high, one day off for yourself where your attending school from your couch doesn't sound all that bad.

Although this concept is already in some schools it needs to be used across all schools everywhere so students can maximize their learning experience.
