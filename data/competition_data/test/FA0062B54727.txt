Optional Extracurricular Activities

Should it be forced that all students participate in at least one after-school activity? I believe students should not be forced to join an extracurricular activity. It is definitely a great experience and attention should be brought to it but not as a requirement. There are multiple draw backs and problems it can cause for families. At first, you might think it's a great idea but if you really think about what has to be done so that children can attend meetings, you might change your mind.

One of great things about public schools is that they're free and most things are cheaper. This is extremely helpful for families who are financially struggling but want their kids to have an education. A lot of after-school clubs or sport teams do things that might cost more than what some families can afford. Parents could feel stressed because they know they can't afford it but at the same time, want their kids to be happy and healthy. Financial problems can cause problems for some families, especially when the school tells them their children are required to do an extracurricular.

Some extracurricular activities don't end until 5 p. m. or later. There are so many students that struggle with focusing and need more time to unwind after a long day. If they are required to participate in an after-school club, this brings even more stress to them. They will be tired when they get home and still have homework to do, causing a student to be up later, which affects their sleep schedule. The less sleep they get, the more tired they are during the school day. affecting their learning ability. Forcing students to attend a sport or other activity can affect their performance in school in a negative way.

Another drawback that forcing students to attend an extracurricular activity is the need of transportation. Public schools transport kids to school and back by bus, which makes the life of families easier. Maybe parents work till 6 p. m. and therefore can't pick up their child. Forcing students to participate in after-school clubs or sports can be a problem for families that aren't able to pick up their kids. Of course, parents can car-pool but that just adds extra stress to the parents who already do so much. They might think that they have to pay back other parents that help transport their kids. Having extracurricular activities not required can let parents find a club that is suitable to their ability to transport their children home.

In conclusion, there are so many problems that forcing students to participate in one or more extracurricular activities causes. The extra stress on families is a lot to handle and will not make things easier. Although joining clubs or sports in your school is a fantastic experience and great thing to have on future resumes, it should be optional. Schools should bring attention to the activities to get students interested instead of requiring it. That's why I disagree with the idea that a school would have it be a necessity for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.
