Dear TEACHER_NAME ,

I strongly believe that we should be able to have our phones at school because you never no they're all kind of things that could happen and your mother may need to get in touch with you. I mean come on if we're not using the phones during class then what's the big hustle about. Lunch and other free times are great times to use our phones. I if we are not taking advantage of the situation by using the phone in class "I say what the heck, is it going to hurt".

Additionally, I feel that if we are making good grades and the phone is not interfering with any of our school work or our academic processes, why shouldn't we be able to have our phone. Now I probably no that they're at least 45 complaints to you ever year about wanting to keep cellular phones in the building and I also am sure that you have heard almost every reason why you should keep cellular phones in the building.

Furthermore, I am confident almost a hundred percent sure that you probably haven't heard if in this perspective. {Say for instance you live with you grandparents and one of them has had a heart attack and you're the only so one who knows their information and your aunt or some one needs the information for the hospital questions how are they going to get in touch with you most likely they don't no the school number only number they can think of is yours cellular. How can you not feel that they're is a need for cell phones after this letter.
