Many people, including nasa, believe that " the Face" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.

First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.

Secondly, the only reason it "has" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.

Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.

Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.

Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.
