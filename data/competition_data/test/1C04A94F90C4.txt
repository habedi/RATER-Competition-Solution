In "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" two men joined a program called Seagoing Cowboys. It is an oppertunity to send food supplies, animals, and more to the people effected in World War II.

Some reasons you might want to join is being able to know you did something good by helping out those in need. By shiping food to people who are starving and giving them materials to build them shelters could really help out many people.

Not only knowing that you did good in someone's life is not all though, on the boat, you can go places and see places that you may not be able to see. Taking care of the animals can be fun, too. You can play with them and have some fun.

You can have some really interesting oppertunities too while your on the boat if you join the Seagoing Cowboys. You can see some amazing places and objects you may never see if you weren't on the boat with the them. Learn something new everyday while your on this boat! In paragraph 9, Luke said, "I'm grateful for the oppertunity." Also in paragraph 5, Luke said, "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice Italy, a city with streets of water."

Not all of the Seagoing Cowboys is all work though. During return trips you can have a lot of fun. I paragraph 8, Luke said that the cowboys play volleyball and baseball games in the empty holds where the animals were kept. Table-tennis, fencing tournaments, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games also pass time while returing home.

Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today and learn something new. See something, learn something, do something good for someone else, and have fun!
