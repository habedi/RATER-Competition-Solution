You're running down the field, lacrosse stick in hand. A defender comes up on you, but you feel a rush of adrenalin and sprint to goal. You shoot, and it's like the goalie is moving in slow motion as the ball soars past her into the net. The crowed go wild, and your teammates all congratulate you. You feel amazing. I agree with participating in a sport or extracurricular activity because you make statistical choices that will help you later in life, make new friends, and have fun.

First, you make statistical choices that will help you later in life. When you play a sport, you need to make smart passes, shots, and strategically plan out plays based on who you're playing. you'll also need statistics later in life for a job. When I played Rec Lacrosse, there was a team from Lexington that was really good. If we had used the same plays we used for them on Blue Ridge, then the game would be a struggle.

Next, you make new friends. When you're part of a team, you bond with people and you're more of a family then friends. When I did Marching Band, the members were around each other for seven or eight months, so we got really close to each other. I still talk to my Marching Band friend for advice, and you know they'll sick with you when you need it.

Lastly, you have fun. When you get the feeling of adrenalin, you start pushing your self to get better, and you have way more fun. Some away competitions and games, you get to stay in a hotel room with no parents, and I've been to the beach for Marching Band. If you try a sport and it's not right for you, do a sport that makes you happy so you can have fun.

Sports and extracurricular have really helped me get through the tough times of middle school. I know that if I were a principal, then I would defiantly make after-school activities a requirement. If you want to have more friendships, be statistical, and have fun while you can, then you need to join an after-school activity.
