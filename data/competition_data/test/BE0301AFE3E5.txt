Hey! The names Luke Bomberger,And it's really "cool" to be a Seagoing Cowboy,How bout' you be one to? When your a Seaging Cowboy you can go and explore places that look interesting to you,oh...and I went to Veince,And I guessed it was pretty intersting and also,Italy and China. I "graduated" in highschool and I had two part jobs until someone offered me a job as a Seagoing Cowboy,Well..I couldn't resist,but to say yes.

Anyways....

Theres also different reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys,its not all about exploring new things if you already knew, You can learn play stuff like "sports" or learn values or get some pointers of working as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Will you ever help someone,So we can make it seem like were "useful hard workers"? Hope so.. :|

But....

Im glad to be a "Seagoing Cowboy",And I hope join us and we can do lots of things together to help eachother out,remeber im Luke Bomberger and Im a Seagoing Cowboy!

Bye Bye :P
