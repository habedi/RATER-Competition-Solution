In my opinion, you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. As a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to explore many new places such as the Atlanic Ocean, new places in the United Stated, and China. To cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, it only takes around two weeks, and about a month to get to China.

Caring for animals always kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship we were traveling on, and all of the stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on my aunts farm helped prepare me for hard work, but not for all of the dangers of the sea. Takes my word for it, being a Seagoing Cowboy, was one of the best expiriences of my life, and I know you would enjoy doing it too.
