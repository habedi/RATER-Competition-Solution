When most people think of space programs in the near future, they often think of missions to Mars. However, this is not the only option. Many scientists at NASA are working to create a Venus space program. This research is supported by the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus". The article does this well, by providing factual evidence, deterring counterarguments, and rethinking the problem to be easier to address.

One of the most important parts of any claim is the evidence. The article fufills this with arguements that Venus is easy to reach. The author states that "Venus is sometimes right around the corner--in sace terms" (Venus 2). They also used evidence to address the problem that Venus is inhospitable to humans. on the surface, Venus is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, but the author points out that a vehicle at a much higher altitude would have a temperature of around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

That isn't the only way problems such as this could be averted. The author also includes some NASA research on elecronics and mechanical computers that use no electricity and don't easily break.

All of these now solved problems have deterred scientists from finding ways to research Venus. The author addresses this as well. They say that "maybe we should think of them [the problems] as challenges"(Venus 6). This way of thinking makes getting to Venus seem much more achievable.

With all of these good traits of an article, the author argued that researching way of going to Venus is a good idea after all. In the end, only time will tell whether humans get to Venus or Mars first.
