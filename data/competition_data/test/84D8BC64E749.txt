Dear Generic_Name,

I am writing to you today to discuss your recent decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe that students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities. Doing so can cause stress for students who are already taking challenging courses, and it can also disrupt the students' parents and the town in order to accommodate for transportation. Additionally, some students may be unable to afford taking part in extracurricular activities. Requiring that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity is unwise, hindering, and futile.

For example, many students are enrolled in challenging courses. These classes are challenging because of their workload and computational difficulty. Consequently, the students will only be more stressed with the addition of an extracurricular activity on top of their schoolwork. This extra layer of stress may cause a decline in the overall academic performance of the students, which in turn will hurt the overall academic performance of the school. The stress may also harm the students' health by causing a lack of sleep. Thus, requiring the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is unwise.

The students are not the only ones to suffer from your decision. Their parents, too, must disrupt their schedules in order to accommodate for the students' transportation. The extra amount of traffic is undesirable for the parents and the town. Additionally, the fuel that is spent on transportation is both costly and harmful to the environment. Essentially, requiring participation in extracurricular activities only hinders the parents, town, and economy.

Lastly, some students may be unable to afford participating in extracurricular activities. Sports equipment, costumes, and paper are all examples of costly items that many extracurricular activities require funding for, often from the participants. Some students cannot even afford their own lunch, so it is physically impossible for them to take part in an even more costly activity. It is futile to require the students to participate in extracurricular activities.

Some may argue that extracurricular activities are worth the time and effort because they allow the students to experience real-life scenarios and develop teamwork and sportsmanship skills. These are valuable and necessary skills and experiences, but not at the cost of the students' health and stable mental state. If the students wish to participate in the activities, then they should, but students with too much work should not be forced to add another activity to their plate.

In conclusion, I disagree with your decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This requirement can cause the students to stress, and it also hinders their parents' work and the town traffic. Some students may not even be able to afford participation in extracurricular activities. Thus, I ask that you reconsider your decision because it is a hindrance to many, unwise, and ultimately futile.

Sincerely,
