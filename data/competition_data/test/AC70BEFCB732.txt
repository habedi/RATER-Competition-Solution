During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education.

When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students.

A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project.

In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses.

Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.
