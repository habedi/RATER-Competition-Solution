One reason why being involved in extracurricular activities benefits you is because it's overall good for you. It can build time management which is a really important skill to have as an adult.

When you have good social skills talking to people and being social builds your self esteem and confidence and your mental health is just as important.

Participating in these extracurricular activities is actually really helpful for your future. Colleges love to hear you've done extra things. Even if you dont plan on going to college the extracurricular activities help you shape your life and see what you would like to do.
