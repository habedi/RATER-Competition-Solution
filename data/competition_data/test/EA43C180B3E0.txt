Statistics show that when a community has given up the use of cars that the amount of polution will go down, excersize levels increase meaning weight problems will go down, and in addition to this, there will be an increase on all round living enviornment and secure a higher quality of life for on coming generations. Why go through all this frustration when the alternative is so near to us. Its simple we don't have to.

Polution is a huge problem in this ever growing world. Its not solving any thing nor is it leaving things better for our new generation ton come. In places like Paris, Bogota, and Vauban Germany these few inovative pioneering societies have given up the past ways of driving and have looked on to better pastures. They ahve reduced polution, the ever growing smog and the relience that man kind has found in automoblies. having a over populance of cars in one place or country can be the game changer when it comes to polution increace if we would just deal with these few over populated areas we would reduce this global warming affect. 12 percent of passenger cars in europe and 50 percent of cars in the US are responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions.

As well they have a no unneccesary congestion, or disruption of the peace of their homes. All this alows them to have a high Quality of living they get more excersize time seeing that they walk every wher. This is solves the huge population of growing obesidy in modern countries. In places like Columbia there was a huge decrease in polution, on a car-free day. Millions were seen biking skating, hiking, and taking the local bus to support the new idea of car-free societies.

When living better it's just as important to excersize as it is to to have a clean and stress free enviornment. The every day problem of missing the bus or getting to work to late is a huge hassel to deal with. Your problems would over with out the use of cars this ensure the percentage of stress to decline. I'm not promissing a life care free but if if it can help why not. "It's a good way to take away stress and lower air polution," a direct quote from a man who has this car-free life. Yes real people are doing this and Yes the results of it are positive. 94 percent of perticipants have agreed that there quality of life now is better than before.

Its not a hard choice to make we either live in this world the way it is now and watch it come to a end, or we make the change that we want to see in it so tommorow I'm asking you instead of driving to work alone take a bike to work with a freind or simply reduse the affects and ride with a bunch of friends or take the bus. Its up to us to see that this world is taken care of so help me to the change.        Â
