First,If i was a scientist at NASA talking to others about them truly believing the Face wasn't created by aliens. I would tell them aliens are not real in the world we live in today. I would also tell them that if aliens was real they would not be able to create Faces. I would also ask them what made you believe aliens create the Face. I would wait for everyone to respone to my question.

Second,I would tell them that i truly dont think that aliens can create things like that in any way possible. I would also try to persuade them to believe what i believe such as aliens are not real at all. I would be trying to figure what they are saying .I would then ask what facts do they have to prove that aliens can create faces. Conclusion,I would have facts to prove my point such as it's a human head and it has a nose,mouth,eyes so their is no way possible an alien could of made the Face.
