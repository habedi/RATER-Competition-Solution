Students would benefit from distance learning because they do not have to worry about the distractions that normal high school brings, students can fit learning into their own schedule, and students can learn in a more comfortable environment. Who would not like to learn from their own home? Especially when normal school is such a drag to even attend and it leaves you feeling like a dried prune by the end of the school day. Distance learning should be given as an alternative for normal school because it can really benefit the students.

Normal school is too much of a distraction. It is a distraction to the point where it is too hard to concentrate in class. Eventually when you are having a hard time concentrating your grades start slipping which would be a horrible scenario. One of the reasons a lot of students have a hard time concentrating in regular school is that people are distracting, for example last Tuesday I had a hard time learning in math class because my peers were being really loud and kept trying to have conversations with me, this made it almost impossible for me to keep up with my teachers presentation of radicals. Additionally regular school has way too much drama which can take your focus off school and put it on the latest gossip instead.

A major benefit to distance learning is that students can fit learning onto their own schedule. Learning on your own time is light years better because you do not have to wake up at seven thirty in the morning feeling like a zombie because you stayed up late last night doing homework. Instead you can sleep in a couple extra hours that way you feel more energized and can maximize learning. Furthermore If you have something important to attend to for example, like some family matters you can just fit your learning around that. Also if you been having a horrible day and struggle to find the motivation to learn, with distance learning you can take the day off and save the school work for the next when you are feeling better.

In addition students tend to find distance learning a lot more comfortable than regular school. Who would not want to learn in from the place they feel most comfortable at. In distance learning you do not have to worry about putting on make up, having a nice outfit, or just looking good in general because its not like people other than your family are going to see you. Also a major problem with regular school is that students worry too much about what their peers think of them which can in turn bring them self confidence issues. while in distance learning you do not have to worry about what other students think of you because either way you are not going to see them.

It can be said that distance learning is not the most comfortable option when it comes to learning because you cannot see your friends which is what a lot of students around the globe look forward to. That is not a problem with distance learning because you can either invite you friends over to help you out while you are learning or you can just hangout with them when you are done learning. Another choice could be to fit your learning around hanging out with your friends. When in comes down to what type of learning parents should really consider distance learning because it is the best way for your child to get an education due to the fact that you can learn on your own time, you do not have to worry about being distracted, and you can learn from where you feel the most comfortable and safe.
