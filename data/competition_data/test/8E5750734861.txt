World War ll was over and alot of damage was done to many countries. Some countries didn't have any food, animals, or supplies. So, Seagoing Cowboys, which are a part of the UNRRA, travel back and forth on a boat that carries a cargo of about 300 horses and enough food to feed them. This is a tough job for just a few guys becasue the animals need food, water, and their stalls had to be cleaned.

If you were a Seagoing Cowboy you would have alot of amazing opportunitys. In the story Luke states in paragraph five " Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing China and Europe. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."

You would also get to help people. You would get to take things that families need to them. Lastly, you could also have fun! On the way back when you don't have any cargo, you play or do fun activites. You could play baseball or volleyball where all of the animals where at on the way to your destination. Also you could box, fence, read, and have table-tennis tournaments.

Some people say they would not want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because of the long trip, but if you were doing fun activites such as reading, boxing, fencing, playing baseball, and taking care of the animals time would pass by. You also have the opportunity to see many new things. You could see China and Greece and lots of other countries. They also don't want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because they think you don't do much, but you get to take care of the animals and play games.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun. You can help others and serve your country also. You would see many new sights and do many fun daily activites.
