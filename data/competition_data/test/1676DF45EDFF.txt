yes this may seem like the aliens did it so it can think its no real , but you have to look at the facts around it. This was taken 25 years ago. This is just a natural landform because its a pixel image , it also reveals as a rock form can be many different objects ,and they can prove it with science equitment.

The face of mars is a pixel image .It is a exact degree angle span. " malins team catpured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution .Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 mters . compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. "As a rule of thumb , you can discern things in a digital image 3 times biggger than the pixelsize, he added". This tells how the image s an exact formation at which you can tell. Aliens wouldnt be able to do that , it can also be a different object other then a face.

this also can be many different things other then a face. It states ".. but the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusua shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation."..."so if there were objects in this picutre like airlanes on the ground or Egyptains-style pyraids or even small shacks , you could see what they were !". This shows the imaghe can reveal anything. Aliens coukd not make anything if they knew what they were gong to make .But scince can also prive that .

Scince equitament how the image can really come off as. For example "...which resembles a human head .. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes , nose and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars....Thousands of anxious web site sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL wed site , revealig ... a natural landform. There was no aien monoutment after all." This proves that there was not alien monoutment face, just a face.

This may seem like aliens do live onmars , but think stuff does land on mars , it could just be a similar reflection. Thankful that scincetheorys can be proven wrong or right.
