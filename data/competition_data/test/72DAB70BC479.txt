Dear Principal,

I think students should be required to perform community service. They all should be required to perform community service because it can help make a change to others.

Like if students help tutor other students or some students clean up litter around the city. It all can help make a change. Students can help elementary school children so they can understand more and succeed in learning of school. Other Students can help clean up litter to keep the place clean and so it looks nice, Go Green. Some students can Recycle things so it can be useable again. Other students can do something and raise money for the school need or for a charity to help out. Be a part of something, help the world be a better place. If you do something nice, you'll get something back in return. Help a hand and make this place even better. Be helpful with others when they need help. Performing in the community service is a important part of life, you can help yourself and many others. Helping is a kind thing to do with other people around you. Even helping just a little can lift someone's spirit up so high. Like they all say Sharing is Caring.

Sincerely,

Student
