This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.

The only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says "Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?

Scientists say that in paragraph 12 "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.

But, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. " The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze". So right now it shows that there could be a possibility that aliens could have made the Face. This one piece of evidence could be the evidence they are looking for.

In conclusion, no one knows what made this interesting Face on Mars. But we do have a lot of information about what could have made it if it wasnt aliens. When we don't have a lot of information here, we can not really think what this Face was made by. All in all we think this Face was made by simple natural landform.
