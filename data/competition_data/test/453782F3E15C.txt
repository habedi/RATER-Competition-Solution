Most people wonder will technology come in handy to read emotions? I believe it could one day. Look at it this way what if we were able to use glasses that had a computers chip in it like spy movies but instead of it being high tech it could read expressions. For instance the article Also states "Using video imagery, the new emotion- recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)." One could possibly imagine how useful it could be for those who are in relationships most guys would know what im talking about because its hard to read ones girlfriends expressions weither they say they're fine when in reality they're not. Just imagine how easy it would be for people to talk about how they really feel when someone that is willing to listen to them about whats on their mind.

In conclusion the world even people will get revolutionized with technology that can read facial expressions.
