Did you will like to finish your High School ,Collage ,and specialize in other carrer? I know somes Schools and Colleges offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from by way online. There are students that work ,and have a carrer and they want following study with other carrer. Students need to finish High School and College.

I agree with that the students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home, jobs or any other place because , I think that is a good opportunity for the teens ,and adults that want a better future .In the first place,some students have a job. The first thing is that students don't want or they can't go to school, and prefer work every day for make money or because don't have the posibilities of go to school and have to work for help their family, I know some cases about this .The second thing is that students take their classes during luch or after work because don't have time for make the homework or study for tests or anything else.

In the seconnd place,some people that are students have their own family and can't following study. I know that have kids,and they need to work for their family ,so they can't study ,and decide to take High School or College via online because don't have the opportunity for go .Also I consider that is more economic for the student that go to the college .

In the third place ,opportunity for a better future .I know that for to many students is more easy study online that go to school ,and decide of them search information for may graduate online because in the United State the College is to expensed and there are many families that don't have mony for pay ,and also some of them don't have paper legal and this to take off the opportunity of study a carrer or be somebady in the life.

Finally,the students should be beniefit from being able to attend classes from home or any other palce .In this way they can will helped ,and finish their study and they can do any other thing in rest of the day and for moments be in the College or High School in a easy way .
