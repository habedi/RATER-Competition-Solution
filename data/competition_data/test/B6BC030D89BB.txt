Beause in A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves luck creaked his ribs beacuse he have to check on some animals and then he fell and he thought he was going overboard but metal stopped him and he was happy to be alive. If you love to travle and be on the sea then this is a perfect job for you. On the job you go to new plarts of the world.

why you shouldn't join is because you might fall overboard and noone might noice that you fell. Or the ship might fail at working and sink and you might not have a boat incase that might happen. What if the ship gets hit and you all start to sink.
