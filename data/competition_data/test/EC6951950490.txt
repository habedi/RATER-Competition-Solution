The advantages in limiting car use is very important.  we would have towrroy as much as we do about drunk drivers or someone dying becasue of car crashes.  We alwys hear on te news about how someone was killed by drunk driving if we limit car usage the deaths of people would be at an all time low.  Also limiting car usage would also mean not as much polution.  we breath in a lot of polution through the day because when trucks drive by all that black smoke goes up into the air that we breath in, that can't be good for our bodies.

Anoter example would be gas, we always complain about how much gas is if we limited cars then we wouldnt have to pay for gas anymore.  To have cars we pay insurance every month if we didnt have cars imagine on how much money we would be saving, on not paying for insurances or gas and other things we need for our cars to be in good shape and safe for us to drive.  Another thing is walking or riding bikes t get to point A to poin B would decrease the chance for obeasty.

I think less crime would happen if we limited cars. For example less peope would be hit, it wouldnt promote drunck driving, it would help the population, and we would have less money problems.  Amerca is in debt so if we limit car usage we could pay off that debt and we would be helping te world at the same time.  By not poluting the air, Our bodies would be in better shape because we would have to walk or ride ikes to get somewhere.

In conclusion, I think if we limit car usage America would be a better lace to live in.  Not as many deaths, money problems, or polution.  In my essay I listed examples of how it would help the economy and people around the world. The world would be a better place with no cars to worry about.  money would not be an issue for most of us wwe would have one less thing to worry about.
