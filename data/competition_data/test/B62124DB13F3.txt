My response towards the policy of students having a B average rather than a C average shouldn't be allowed because a C average is what most students have and if its raised to a B average than students have to work harder to maintain that average. If the principal considers the average grade to participate in sports and/ or activities should be raised she should at least give us the reasons she feels the average should be raised. I disagree with this because it puts on more work for the student wanting to join a sport, activity, or even both I feel the student shouldn't work so hard on his or her grade just so they can participate in a sport and\ or activity.

A question I have is what if a student has a bad average then realizes that he or she want to participate in something then finds out they don't like what they joined at all. Then the student will feel that they did real hard work for nothing and doesn't like the fact that their school makes students maintain a high average just to join and participate a sport and\ or activity. I mean who knows what that student might do maybe change schools or beg parents to go into independent studies or worst of all drop out just because they don't like the fact that they have to work so hard just to join a sport and\ or activity. It may or may not happen, but there's always a possibility and chance it may happen.
