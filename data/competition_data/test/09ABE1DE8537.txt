The summer projects should be teacher-designed. Due to the fact that if it is student- designed, students would take advantage and make it too easy. So in elementary school a teacher said to make our own projects during the summer, so some of the kids decided to do a project about books, so those kids did a summary about a book for babies. Those kids did a summary about the cat in the hat. Therefore, the kids passed without learning anything, because it was too easy. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

Sometimes students might make it too easy. The students designed their own projects. The projects were about reading any book they wanted. Most of them picked kids books. So on the first day of school they all got good grades for doing preschool work. Due to that the kids didn't learn a single thing all summer. Some teachers believe that the key to success is hard work. So thats why some teachers will make students do summer projects hard so the student can retain and gain more knowledge. In elementary school there was a teacher that during any break we had like winter break, spring break, and summer break, she would give us a very hard project and every time she would give us the project she would say, " I am making you all do this work because i want all of you to be successful."

Students are willing to take advantage of easy work. Teachers just want their students to grow up and be successful.

Some people would say, " What if the students decide to make the work harder." Most teachers give students summer projects to keep the students mind strong. Junior is in high school and he decides to make his project hard so then he can learn more information. Sometimes a person doesn't need to work harder when they can work smarter. Generic_Name was trying to work on a packet his teacher gave him for summer but it was too much, so he asked his friend to come over so they can work together. If a student decides to make his project harder, then they will have more of a challenge. Some students begin to forget everything they learned at school so the projects are to keep their mind strong and educated.

Well if the student makes the project too hard, then they won't be able to enjoy their summer break. The summer projects are pointless, because they are going to relearn everything in the beginning of the new school year. Generic_Name decided to make his project as hard as possible and due to him doing that it took him all summer to finish it. so during the end of the school year, my class was learning complex math equations, but then towards the beginning of the new school year we began to learn about complex math equations.

Summer projects shouldn't be student-designed, but instead teacher-designed. Back in elementary school kids used to take advantage of student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects aren't too easy but also aren't too hard.
