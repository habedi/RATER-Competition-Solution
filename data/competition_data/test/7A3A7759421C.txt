No not really that has nothing to do with the classroom and a lot of kids feel the same in a classroom. The kids in a classroom that i see or seat in are mostly bored or tired,but some kids are awake and have their eyes on the board or teacher to learn.

I think this would be a waste of time in the class unless you are useing youing it on little kids. Most of the older kids are way past a computer that can show a happy or sad face . I have a fine time talking to people in the real world not a computer,if a computer made a weird face at me i would probalby get up and walk away from it. This is kind of dumb i think you should be able to know or ask some one about their feelings in the real world not on the computer pull up a weird face to show how they feel. I strongley dislike this in a lerning zone because then how are kids to know how other people feel without the computer telling them,with a happy,sad,and mad face coming up on the screen. This is somthing a human should know how to tell human feelings.
