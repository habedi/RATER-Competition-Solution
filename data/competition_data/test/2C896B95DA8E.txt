Dear Principal,

I don't think cell phones should be allowed at school at any time. The reason i think this is because; it would be unfair to others, some people would take advantage of it, you should be studying or finishing work during your free time, having phones out at school could cause many problems, people would use phones to cheat on test or class work, and grades would start slipping in with many people because their phones would distract them from doing their work.

Some ways it would be unfair to others is; those who don't have a phone wouldn't have the same advantages as others, while others are at free time or lunch the people in class wont get to have their phones, and those that don't have free time won't get to use their phones.

Also, some kids would always have their phones with them and they would be texting instead of paying attention to the lessons. By doing that they wouldn't learn a thing. Therefore they are taking advantage of he privilege given to them.

Free hour or free time should be used to study or make up on late or unfinished assignments. Free periods or free time is given to you for certain reasons, it is school time still, and you should use that time for school work not for social time.

Having cell phones period causes problems imagine what it could do at school. Rumors and gossip will be spread around way more and a lot faster then without phones. Cyber bullying and fights will happen more. Phones may possibly be stolen or lost and that would not be good.

Some people who aren't in class and have access to their phones might help someone cheat on a test or just the class work they have, and in that case grades from many people would slip because they aren't actually learning. Without students actually learning the school might start to look bad.

I hope you agree with all or some of these conditions. I honestly believe cell phones and schools were not meant to be together.

Sincerely,
