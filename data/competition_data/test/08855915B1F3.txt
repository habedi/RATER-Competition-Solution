Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Today, we talked about changing the school policy to where students have to have at least a B average. I don't believe that is right, the basketball team is already short of people if you were to change the policy we probably would not have enough people of one team. Also, student have the right to have a C, it is not failing. I am here to speak for the basketball team and soccer team.

I state that we do work hard on our grade and have our heads in a book. I believe we can work harder to get most of our grades to a B average. Before, you agree to this policy i believe you should strongly suggest reconsidering this strong demand. If you do say all students must have a B average then you might not have enough people on any sport except track an tennis.

Therefore, we did not even have a soccer team an now that we get one it might be cut in half. Then there will after a while there might not even be any sports. So, by the time the kids get to the high school they will not have learned anything (sports wise) which will bring the sports ranks down a Duncanville high school. But, some parts of me agree with this there might be an good side in this i just cant see it yet!
