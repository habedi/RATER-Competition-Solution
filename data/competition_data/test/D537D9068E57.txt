In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is the second planet from the sun and is known as the evening star. It's a plant that is easy to see far away but hard and dangeorus to see up close. The authors gives a lot of reasons why Venus is important and different why to learn more about it.

Some reasons Venus is worth sudying is it's the closest planet to Earth by size and density. Not one single spaceship was been able to land on Venus for more then three decades. And some people belivie this is because no one has survived on Vanus more then a few hours. The artice said it is dangerous because clouds od highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The temperature on Venus is averaged around 800 degrees fahrenheit. And the atmospheric pressure is 90 times what we experince here on Earth. A lot of scientist feel that venus is the plant that is the most Earth-like. Becuase the Plant has a rocky surfaces and have similar features like mountains, valleys, and craters.

So this is the details I found to support the idea of studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. And I feel in a couple of years it's not going to be dangerous anymore. I feel this way becuase NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. These are simplified electrons made of silicon carbide and mechanical computers. And this are going to help becuase they are going to last longer on the surface and you won't have to get out to sample the rocks, gas and everything else. And they are going to be more powerful, flexible, and quick.
