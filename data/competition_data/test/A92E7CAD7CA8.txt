Luke, the man that shipped 335 horses, and enough hay and oats to feed them all. People should sign up to be a Seagoing Cowboys.

The reason people should sign up is you are helping other nations rebuild them selves. you are helping nations rebuild them selves by rebiulding houses, farms, and shops. You are also helping by sending animals to the other countries, so they can start a farm again. It is also helping people recieve food for their emty stomachs.

If people don't sign up for the UNRRA the nations will fall to the ground. People will starve, if they survive the harsh cold winter. Did I also mention the harsh cold winter that thousands of people will die from if they you don't help!

What you will be doing on the ship is feeding, and wattering the cattle thwo or three times a day. Second is you will also have to keep night watch, and take care of the cattle. Third is you you will be on nine trips stopping at different nations. if it is a rainy day you need to be careful, because you can be injured or killed.

Another reason you should join is you will be travalong around the world shipping cattle to other nations, and farms. When all the cattle is off the ship you can have set up some equipment to play some storts for example. Volleyball, ping pong turnaments, and much much more. The trip will also open up the world to you, because you helped thousands of people around the world. It will also stay with you making you happie.

In conclusion all the horses you shipped will make thousands of people happie. It will also rebuild nation, farms families, and cities. The horses will be breeded, and also used for transport. Anyways please sign up to the UNRRA America! Thank you
