Face on Mars! Natural landform? or Created by Aliens? I believe that the structure is a natural landform. NASA would not want to hide life on mars. They have been researching for years to find life on Mars.

NASA has been researching Mars for years looking for living things. Nothing was ever found. So, why believe there was ever ancient civilization on Mars, if through out all the research, nothing was ever found. Some still disagree and believe that there is new life on Mars. But, in order for there to be a new there has to be an old.

When Garvin decided he wanted to get a better look at the face on Mars himself, he also agreed that it would be a natural landform. He used a digital image three times bigger that the pixle size. Therefore, if there were any signs of live, shakes, houses, aliens, ect. you would be able to point it out from the picture.

Yet, there was still nothing found. Although some people still believe aliens live on Mars, and aliens created the face structure. There is proof that you can not spot any digns of life on Mars. So, therefore, we come to the conclusion that the structure was a natural landfor, that just so happened to look like a face.
