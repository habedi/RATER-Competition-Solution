What is it? "Unmasking the Face on Mars" is an article that explains to us what the face on Mars actually is. The "face" on Mars is actually a type of landform called a mesa. It was proven to us by the revealing in 1998 and the 2001 image.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia while Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) took pictures of the landform. The pictures were ten times sharper than the one picture the Vikings had revealed. When the image had first appeared on the JPL wedsite, thousands of anxious web surfers were disappointed. The image revealed that the "face" was actually a natural landform. "There was no alien monument after all."

It was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia on April 8, 2001, when the Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the landform to snap a picture. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field view," said Garvin. The team had captured a clear picture using the camera's maximum resolution. "Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." That image proved all those wrong of who thought of it to be a "face."

So, the "face" on Mars is actually a type of lanfrom called a mesa due to the revealing in 1998 and the 2001 image. Both of those images proved to us that the "face" was not a face or an alien monument, but an actual landform. Also, if your able to comapre it to another landform, like in paragraph 12, then you understand it pretty well to know what it actually is if you've done the research.
