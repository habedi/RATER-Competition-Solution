There could be reasons of how you can join the program. There is a lot of reasons. Luke had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Luke signed up to join the program, which is, UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrations). The program hired "Seagoing Cowboys."

The program hired "Seagoing Cowboys" because they can take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and his friend signed up and they went to New Orleans. They found horses there. They keep on going to places, that was like an adventure to them. They keep on going and they were arriving to Greece for their second mission.

Luke turned 18 before arriving to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said, "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special." Luke was also taking a ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water too. He was looking at a lot of things in Greece. His next stop was at China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlanta Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was so busy taking care of the animals. He took so many adventures. Being a Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him.

There was a lot of adventures going on. It took him years to go around the world and explore. He was great of being a Seagoing Cowboy. He even loved to going to this mini adventures. It was a great experinced.
