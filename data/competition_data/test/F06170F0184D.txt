Every student loves summer vacation. They love Staying home relaxing, going out with friends, swimming at the pool, and so much more! What students do not like during summer vacation though is school related projects.

Students are giving projects during the summer to make sure they continueÂ learning and improve their education. That is not always fun, especially for students when they have summer break.

Everyone loves to relax and not do anything. That is what summer vacation is for, it allows people, especially students to have some quality time off. Students do not always do their homework, from personal experience that is true. That is why they have less chance of doing projects during the summer when they can be relaxing instead. If they are giving the option to select their own projects they desire, they will more likely finish the project and have fun while doing it.

That allows students to stay interested in a certain topic they love to learn about. This makes projects during break way more fun, and it increases the chances of students doing the projects. From personal experience, learning about topics I am passionate about or interested in, makes it way more fun to research and learn about.

People might disagree that students do not don't care about their projects, or that they won't do it, regardless what topic it is about. That is false, humans are curios creatures, learning is part of the everyday life for everyone. Learning is fun and it helps individuals develop as a person. Students are more likely to work on projects that is important to them, topics that they love learning about.

Everyone enjoys time off, but there is times when everyone has to do work. During summer break, students have time for both. Summer projects will help keep their minds ready and assure they learn during break, while they also have time to relax. Students will increase their effort in projects if the topic is more interesting for them.

They should have the choice to choose what projects they want to do on their summer break.
