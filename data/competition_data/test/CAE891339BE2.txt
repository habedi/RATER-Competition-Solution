Twenty five years ago , NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet.

There was a face on mars but it wasnt really a face it was a mesa. But to me it kind of looked like a face popping out oof the mars planet. But it is kind of wierd that someone pictured a face on the earths planet like that. I think it became popular.

Some scientists believed it was an alien articraft, but it probably was but i think it wasnt. I just think it was a rock shaped like a face to me. The face of mars is located at 41 degrees norht martian latitude. If i was in space i wish i would be the first one to discover that face because i could probaby get famous or get a lot of money. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.

What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. But thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. There was no alien after all. But a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see.

But the caption noted a huge rock. No face at all.

The Face on Mars has become a pop icon. So it is popular. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. That is amazing this face on mars has a become very famous and very known. Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide.
