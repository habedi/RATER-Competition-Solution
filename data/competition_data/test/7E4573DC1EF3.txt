Facial Action Coding System is a form of technology that people are using to be able to tell how some ones feeling by using a computer to constructa 3d model of the face and study all the muscles in the model to see what you are feeling. i just going say it this just sound like a waste of time and money.

it a waste of time because i think we could be able to do more thing then finding out people emoitions instead we could have be able to help out people with cte of any other major pshycologic disies instead its just focussing ono emotion and yes i understand emotions can help us diagnos people with those issues but all i hear i this passage is about emotions nothing else . this is also a huge waste of money,why the technology being used sound like its cost a bunch of money to produce.
