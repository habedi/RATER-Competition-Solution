The author of " The Challenge of Exploring Venus " supports his idea in a great way. He uses Facts , Desriptive Language , and a Comparison. These three things help a reader understand and better believe what the author is telling them. Without any evidence the reader wouldnt understand what theyre reading. The author also made sure to inclue dates of things which is an important stradigy.

The facts that were included in this passage made you really open up to the idea of Venus and the dangers. One of the facts i read were in Paragraph One Sentence Three where it said " In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. "

When you read this you already notice how warm it would be there. In Paragraph Three Sentence Three it tells you the exact tempature is 800 degrees and the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. After reading this you can already tell that it would be super dangerous. Another danger is what you read in paragraph three sentence one it says " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus " In this sentence you can tell its dangerous even by the wording. carbon dioxide isnt good for human bodies either. The other way the writer supported his idea was by using Descriptive Language. An example of him using that is in Paragraph Four Sentence Five it says " The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters." this tells you how it would look and be like on venus. The last way is using a relatable comparison. The author did this in Paragraph Five Sentence Five. it says " but the air pressure would be close to that sea leval on earth. "

In conclusion the author did a great job including facts , camparisons , and descriptive language.
