Dear principle,

It is important to require every student in your school to take on a community service project for the following reasons. first of all the community pays taxes and helps fund your school so it is important to give back. Secondly, it is important for a community to work together, Lastly students need to perform community service because it would help educate the members of your school.

To begin the students in your school need to perform a community service because if the community helps fund your school, and all the activities that the kids in your school get to enjoy are because of the taxes that the community pay. it is your responsibility to repay the community for helping you run a school. also if your kids don't give back to their community then the community might frown upon your school. If your school is disliked in the community then why would they support your school, they wouldn't. To keep your school well liked among the community, you need to have your kids do community service. Those are just some of the reasons that it should be required for every kid in your school to perform a task for the community.

Another reason that the children in your school should be required to complete a community service project is to keep a healthy, selfless community. If everyone was just out for themselves and no one else where would the world be, not in a good place. Although if the members of your school step up and take responsibility for not only themselves but for the well being of other people than your community could thrive and that could help the members of your school realize that if everyone helps out just a little bit that you could achieve great things. That is what i think of keep a community chaos free helping each other.

Lastly, if you require a community service project to be completed in your school than the members of your school could see the effects of it first hand. They could experience the joy of helping someone that is either unwilling or unable to help themselves. That would open their eyes and allow them to continue helping not only their community but the world as well. By seeing the effects first hand your students could be inspired to continue helping people with their troubles. If everyone helps just a little bit than the world would be a much better place. That is why your students should be able to experience the joy of giving back to their community.

In review the reasons that you should require your students to complete a community service project is to help fund the school. Help keep the community free of turmoil, and allow your students to experience the joy of giving back first hand. Those are the reasons that you should require a community service project to be completed by the student at your school.

Sincerely,
