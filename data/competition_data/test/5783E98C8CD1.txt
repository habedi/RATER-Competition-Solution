Ever tried to walk a block to the store to get some things or walk to a friends house just cause it was so close? Many people don't nowadays because their are motored vechicles available for you if youre over 15 with a license or permit. We have to start reducing our car usage. Their are always many alternatives that can not only be relaxing and stressless but better for our enviroment. Some good alternates to driving would be to walk, bike, ride the bus, subway, train, or jog.

There are many advantages to reducing the usage of cars but one of the biggest may be that we are harming our enviroment, half of the air population in the United States comes from vechicles. We can't keep continuing to ruining our future generation's home. If we use cars and increase our car usage the effects of this are left for our kids and grandkids to clean up after.
