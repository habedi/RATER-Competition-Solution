Some schools offer distance learning as an option fro students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I disagree with students being able to have distance learning at home. students could do nothing at all, get in trouble, and not have good experience with people if decided to go to college.

Students could do nothing at all if their supposed to be home learning. A couple examples: opportunity to play around, be lazy, and loosing education and knowledge. Teens are not responsible at home to learn. Most dont even do homework at home s why have students have control over it. Adults needs to manage that. Teens brains arent fully developed so they dont take much serious. They like to play outside, play video games, and sleep at the wrong times when students are supposed to be working. Students would just loose their education just worst then most do at school.

Another reason, students get in trouble entirely to much. Imagine having them not in a classroom learning, but instead not taking control for themselves and messing around outside a school on a daily. Could break laws like speeding through traffic, being a daredevil doing things that could get them in jail and loosing their chance to graduate on time. Having them home isnt a good idea and doesnt help them. Some student need to be taught directly to them or just in a classroom. It is known that when taking a test, quiz or classwork another teacher takes kids out of the classroom to another class that needs to helped direct or read to them.

Finally, students wont have good experience with people if they decide to go to college. Individuals wont know how to interact with other students and could be teachers too. A student does to college and is in a big class that has 200 other students in it and that has to present a project. Being home in the pasted years is disturbing to their work ethic and other students is peer pressuring them and rushing them, but their so afraid to go on with their project. College is an experience where you have to communicate with people. Wanting to be in clubs, sports you cant communicate because you were at home and not in a classroom doing work preparing you for the real world.

Go to school, have face to face conferences, experience a work ethic around people. People would take that more serious.
