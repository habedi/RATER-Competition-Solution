Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that if you kids use there phones in school the will more then likely cheat on a quiz or a test. I have herd of kids from different schools who have been able to bring there phones to class. Of course they over used it and cheated on homework and the where getting on the internet and looking up bad things and more kids were becoming bad. The teachers were just done dealing with all the kids who were cheating on test and texting in class. I also think that if we could bring our phones to class that it would be good for some kids because then we could text our parents and tell them we need lunch money, homework, backpacks, and anything we left at home. Today i know kids in our school that text and call people during school hours, i' m not going to say any names but kids do it all the time and personally, knowing all the kids i know, they will completely over abuse this if we allow it at SCHOOL_NAME.

I am still going to go with Policy 1 because I use my cell phone in the hall or at my locker sometimes. My cell phone is always in my pocket turned off i call my mom or dad to ask if they can bring me up my lunch money or homework. If you let kids bring there phones to school, and they promise to use them in a needing time. I have fear that some one will break in to the school and/or the school will catch on fire so I always keep my phone in my pocket and i have the police on my quick dial on my phone. I would hate for someone to break in and no one is able to call 911 so i think they should allow kids to bring there phones to school.

But what makes me really mad is when teachers say "Ok kids put your phones away and spit out your gum and no drinks in class." and they are sitting in the front of the room texting and drink diet soda and chomping on some bubble gum. That is just one thing that grinds my gears. they are so hypocritical sometimes. I promise to you that this happens to me at least two time a day a teacher catches a kid with gum and tells him to spit it out and then the teacher starts to chew on a piece. Last year one of my English comp. teachers was drinking a redbull and eating resses peanutbutter
