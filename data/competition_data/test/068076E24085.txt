There are many times I look at my friends and i see something is wrong, ask them what is wrong but they say nothing. I feel like in doing this and having something that can tell emotions is a good invention. I could also be a bad invention too. We have never had an invention like this before so it could be very interesting.

When it comes to a device that identifies human emotions it is a sticky situation as to if it is good or not. Many people do have this issue where they feel they need to know someones emotion but they cannot read them. I honestly do not believe this device will really come in handy in every day life. I do not see someone talking to their friend and saying, "what's wrong?" Well actually do not answer that because i have a great facial action coding system that will tell me how you feel. No one would do that. It is strange for anyone to do that. In school there is also no serious need for this system many student are either sad from a break up or tired from lack of sleep. There is not much that needs to be seen in reguards to students. On the other hand i do see it to be a good thing because you can use it for like people in higher power such as the president or the vice president to see exactly how they are feeling. Overall i just feel like it is something neat to try out but it will not be of too much value.

Having something that can tell emotions is something good but it can also be something bad. To me it is a great invention but people will not use it. People will think it is great for a month or so until it goes out of trend and we replace it with the next new cool gadget. This is a cool invention but i view it as unneeded.
