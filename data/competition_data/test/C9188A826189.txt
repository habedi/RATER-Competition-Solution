Could the Face on Mars be made by aliens? Sorry to say but no the Face on Mars wasn't made by aliens. Back when it first was foundby NASA's Viking, in 1976, I bet a lot of people thought that it could be made be aliens. Since then, NASA has confurmed it as a natural landform.

The picture from the Viking in 1976 was not clear and had 43 meters per pixal. Now in 2016 43 meters per pixal is like anchent to us. In 1998, NASA's Mars Global surveyor (MGS)

took another photogragh of the Face. The picture was a little more clear but NASA still couldn't tell forsure that the Face was a natural landform. In 2001, NASA's MGS took another photogragh of the Face on Mars. The picture from 2001 as the most clear picture of the Face and the latest image of the Face. Each pixel in the 2001 photogragh spans 1.56 meters. That is much better quality then in 1976 with 43 meters per pixal.

Since 1976 NASA has had two other oportunities to get a picture of the Face. NASA confurmed that the Face is a natural landform on the planet of Mars. The picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These landforms are common around the American West.

The Face reminds Garvin of the " Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. NASA has confurmed that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.
