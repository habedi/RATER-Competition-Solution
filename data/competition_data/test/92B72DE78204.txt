Dear Principal,

I understand that you are trying to make our community better with community service ,but forcing students to do this I believe is not right. Some students wish to do community service but do not have the time to do so.

They might have a job after school, or have to take care of younger siblings. Also after school is a time when children like to hang out with there friends and family. Children also take time after school to do homework and relax after a hard day at school. Children who are a little slower might ask teachers for help after school as well and if they where forced to do community service there grades might suffer. My friends and I hang out after school and help each other with our homework ,if we had to do community service we would be able to help each other with our homework and would never get to hang out. For those people who have to watch younger siblings after school the might get in trouble with parents and there younger siblings would have to stay home alone. Students who are slower wouldn't be able to stay after school and there grades would suffer because the don't get the help they need.

Some students love doing community service when they have the time but some children never have time to do community service. This is why i think forcing children to do community service is a bad idea you never know what will happen to one student there grades could fall, they might loose friends, the could get nerves, and some would never have time to hang out with family's.

senecraily, your student
