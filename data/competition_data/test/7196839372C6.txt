i think that we should use technology to read students emotional expressions because now we don't really see what a student might be feeling so thats why we have technology and with the high techology advances we have now we can try to atleast see what a student might be feeling like or atleast try to figure out what he is feeling or how he or she might be feeling. and it all works out because now researchers have computers that construct a 3-D model of our faces and all 44 major muscles in the model move like human muscles. even though most people dont show that they are happy or upset most of the time they might be and thats why the researchers perform an impressive calculation each day. also i think using technology is the best idea because what else can we use to read someones facial expressions besides the fact that we can recognize some but not all facial expressions.
