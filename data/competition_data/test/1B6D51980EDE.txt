Technology has become a crucial part of modern society. The online revolution has reached nearly every industry across the world. Throughout this movement, new industries and companies have been created that were never imagined before, and others have been made obsolete. In today's world, technology plays an important role in everyone's lives. For this reason, it is necessary that children be taught how to utilize technology. Although some believe that schooling should remain traditional, there is no better way to benefit children in today's age than introducing them to technology through online classes within their schooling. Online classes would instill critical life skills, such as self motivation, increase attendance, and prepare students for the work force.

Online classes are a great way to teach self responsibility within students. When taking an online class there is no teacher in the room making students get onto their computer and finish their work. Instead, they are responsible for motivating themselves to do so. Additionally, experts say that life long habits are formed at a young age. So learning to motivate yourself to get work done is a great skill to learn young. This will also help students learn to cope with procrastination. When students who have taken online classes reach college, their prior experience with procrastination will prevent them from falling behind like so many students do when, suddenly, there is no one looking out for them as their parents used to. Online classes instill self-motivation and responsibility from a young age, setting students up for future success.

Today's schools are plagued with attendance issues. Not only are students skipping school, but many others are forced to stay home sick, causing them to miss valuable education time and setting them back in class. This is prevalent today more than ever when entire school districts are closing due to the recent Covid-19 outbreak. However, if classes were online they would not be missing any schooling. Students could simply work from home and continue on their path. Some schools have adopted this, such as those in South Korea, where classrooms have transitioned to online until the outbreak passes. Another benefit to at home schooling is the ability to work at your own pace. Students would no longer feel left behind in the classroom, and encouraged to stay home because of it. In the same token, students who feel they are wasting time in class because they are so much faster than others, would have the ability to work at their own pace. In conclusion, online classes would increase attendance by allowing students a more flexible schedule and empowering them to keep participating even if unable to come to class.

Modern offices have rapidly transitioned to the internet in recent years. Companies who once required their employees to come into the office every day now allow them to work from home. Additionally, meetings that once occurred in person can now be done through online video conferencing. Modern jobs require workers to be flexible and able to work online. Some employees do not even receive offices anymore because they save the company money and simply are not necessary. Online schooling would give students experience in this modern work space. These students would be experienced in video conferencing and other necessary skills which will be required of them in the future. Additionally, students would have the benefit of working from home like many employees do today. Working from home would not only allow students to learn in a more comfortable environment, but, would also help solve the issue of over crowded schools.

In conclusion, empowering students to attend classes online and from home would help set them up for success in the future. Students would develop crucial life skills, as well as experience beneficial to the modern work space. Additionally, online education would save time and money for students and schools alike.
