The use of cell phones are important to teens, children, and even adults in everyday life. Although sometimes it may be dangerous to use cellular devices while you drive, we also need them for important decisions. These reasons vary in situations where we have calls, GPS, or even change the song that you might not want to listen to at the time. Therefore, the use of cellphones while one is driving is important.

A GPS (global positioning system), helps lots of us drivers pinpoint our location, and take us from one place to another. However sometimes, we may need to change our destinations or even stop the route while under the control of a vehicle. For example, say if a lady was driving to a destination, and she started to change the location because she typed in the wrong one, that would be a good reason as to why us humans should be able to use our phones while we drive. Without us being able to use our phones to do so while we drive, we could all possibly end up at different places than we expected to be. This can go as far as to restaurants, stores, and different people houses.

Phone calls from our family, friends, and even ones who you work with are important to pick up while you're driving. To help out with these situations, you have equipment that can be placed on your window so you won't have to look away from the street to answer your device. For example, if you're receiving an important call, and you are aware that you cannot look away, this object will help you and make it easier for you to be on your phone. By doing this, this can reduce the chance of injuries and accidents by allowing someone to focus on the road and a important call at the same time.

Using your phone to change songs on the radio or your own device is significant. For example, you can have kids in the car and the song might have inappropriate words for them. Because of that, you may have to use your phone to change songs if it is off the device. Also, if the person doesn't want to listen to the songs that are playing, then the need for someone to be able to use their phone while driving is important to us.

In conclusion, the needs that we have to access our phones while driving is necessary. If we weren't able to answer calls, use the GPS, change music with the object then things would be different. We could have emergencies and problems that needs to be taken care of as soon as possible. Therefore, the human race should be able to use their phones while driving to accomplish these needs. If car manufactures could make the hands free device more safe for us drivers, everybody should be able to use their phone while driving.
