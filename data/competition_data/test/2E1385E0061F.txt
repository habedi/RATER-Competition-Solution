Student-designed summer projects are the way to ensure continued learning over their own summer break. When dealing with summer projects they are often described as tedious, inconvenient, and boring. Due to that assumption, summer projects are rarely completed throughout the summer. Students view the summer as their personal time off and would much rather enjoy that time then waste it on a difficult, time-consuming chore. Unfortunately, not completing your summer projects stops a students summer education (which impacts their overall education) and starts a students school year off in a negative, empty-handed way. To prevent that the simple solution is to let them take complete charge when it comes to their projects. Letting students design their own projects means making summer school projects enjoyable, challenging but understandable, and time-convenient.

Firstly, a student will enjoy work more if they can personally relate to it. Teacher-designed summer projects are viewed as boring and unexciting, and due to them relating to the work of the class they typically are. To produce an enjoyable summer project a teacher must find something each student can relate to and include it. Unfortunately, a teacher cannot relate to every student in that way and the disconnect begins a dislike of the work in the student. Once that initial dislike is started it's difficult to get the student to complete the work. However, if a student can create the work they want to create, they're going to do so because only an individual student can relate to themselves in such a way. With a student-designed summer project the student can personally relate to the work, find it enjoyable, and feel encouraged to participate and complete it thus starting the continued learning.

Secondly, a student will feel encouraged to complete the work if they understand it. When dealing with a teacher-designed summer project it is usually created to enlighten and prepare students as to what their coursework is going to be like. As classes go up so does their difficulty level. This explains why teacher-designed projects are challenging, especially for someone who has yet to take the actual class. A fear of failure and a lack of understanding can make any student want to neglect and not complete their work therefore putting an end to their summer break education. Giving students the right to create their own coursework means they can challenge themselves personally and understand it perfectly. Only students can know themselves well enough to classify their own difficult level and ensure their project reflects it. By doing so they can create practical, efficient work that is related to the coursework and understand it in their own way, much like what they would eventually have to do in the actual class.

Finally, a student-designed project can ensure that a student will have enough time to complete the project. When a teacher designs a summer project they must make sure it covers enough information and takes up enough time. That can be stressful for students who don't have their entire summer off as most do. Students who work jobs, leave and visit other places, or even babysit their siblings don't have the same amount of time as most students and can feel overwhelmed by their inability to balance everything. That stress will force them to delay or discontinue their summer projects and put an end to their summer education. To prevent that a student-designed project means a project that can incorporate the individual student's schedule in and ensure they have enough time to complete it. Incorporating a busy student's schedule takes the stress off of their back and encourages them to put the time they have into creating an astounding summer project.

Many could argue that a student-designed summer project will produce an unreliable project. Students can get lazy over summer break and decide to take the easier route instead of actually applying themselves. In the case of something like that occurring the only person the student is hurting is themselves. If the student chooses not to apply themselves they are putting themselves at a disadvantage. Taking this opportunity for granted will just ensure that a student's school life will not be any easier because of the grade they receive on it, and their lack of understanding with the coursework. Others could also claim that a student-designed project will not meet the required guidelines of the coursework but that lack of effort once again only hurts the student.

In conclusion, A student-designed project is a project that will encourage summer education by making summer projects enjoyable, understandable, and time convenient. Encouraging student to create and find new ways to understand difficult things guarantees them way to overcome the same trials throughout life. The ways to make summer projects fun and less work are simple and should be applied in every school that wants an efficient and practical summer education and students who will grow into well-rounded adults.
