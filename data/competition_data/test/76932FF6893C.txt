Dear Principal,

I believe all students must be required to do community service. Community service is a good thing. Community service can change the community and make it better. Community Service can help make kids be more respectful and Community doesn't have to be a really hard job. Community service can be fun. Some fun ways of community Service is baby sitting, mowing yards, picking up trash, and walking a dog. You may not think these jobs are fun but they can be. Like Baby sitting, it can be fun because you can play with the baby and when it goes to sleep you can basically do whatever you want to do. Mowing yards i think is a fun job because you get to ride around most of the time. Picking up trash is a dirty job but can be made fun if you bring a bunch of friends and do it together because you will most likely be laughing the whole time and it time will go by fast. walking a dog is fun be cause you get exercise and you can play with the dog.

Most people think of Community Service as work but i think of it as an opportunity to help others and become more respectful and to have more responsibility and pride in what I do. Think of it this way some people are disable and they can pick up around the community and make it clean. But you can and if you get out there and do it you and the rest of the community can see a beautiful Earth like God planned for it to be.

Sincerely,

A Student
