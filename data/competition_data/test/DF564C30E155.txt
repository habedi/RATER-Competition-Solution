Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that community service is a great requirement to obtain with the students. There are a majority of students that believe that this is a reasonable decision, however, there are some students that think that it is an irrational decision.

From my perspective, I would do the work because despite the fact that I play a lot of basketball and volleyball leagues at once, even I can fit in some community service. I don't believe that it is a matter of being able to fit it into your schedule, but a matter of being motivated to participate in these events. In the past I have taken part in some community service activities, when I reflect on those memories I have come to realize why some young adults as well as children do not like them. This is because there are two different types of community service events. One's that you can take part in and enjoy and ones that are boring that you have to put up with anyway. These can be fit into categories for different people interests.

Another variable is the benefit of participating in these events. Sometimes if there is no positive end result applying to themselves or benefit of participating in these events than children will prevent any way to help. If we can some how create realization and open peoples eyes to the opportunities that are right in front of them than that will reduce the population of children preventing the work. The benefit can be a prise or maybe just make them conceive and hopefully treasure how they've contributed to helping a cause or what ever the situation may be.

If you can identify the type of kid that you are dealing with than I believe that community service will be much easier to with hold within ours and many other school districts. If we can start by sacrificing time to help out than we can influence other districts and hopefully it will spread like a wild fire and create a community of children helping. With many children taking part, this may become a volunteer choice for many children or just make it an easier experience for them to acknowledge.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
