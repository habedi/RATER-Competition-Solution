Community services

Dear, TEACHER_NAME i am sending you this letter in response to your requirement that all students do community services. In this letter i will tell you what I believe are the pluses and minuses of community services are. I will also tell you about what i think the overall decision should be to make all students happy.

Let me start of with this I think community services are a good thing for kids to do in there spare time because it overall benefits all people in some way. So with that i know that some kids probably already do community services and some kids probably have never heard of community services.

The benefits of community service are they help the people in need or help keep the earth a clean place to live. For example if you are helping out a homeless shelter you are helping out the homeless people to make there lives better. If you are cleaning garbage then you are helping save peoples lives because it stops polluting the air. So these are just two of the many ways that community service is good.

I don't really think there are necessarily anything bad from doing community services but i think there are many kids in this school that after school the have to go to sports and then get home and have to do there homework and then on weekends they have family stuff or sports tournaments so they just don't have time to do it.

So i believe that the overall best solutions is that you encourage kids to do community services and maybe have one day every month that the kids take two hours of school to go outside and clean up or go on a couple of field trip to homeless shelters or other places like that so that the kids fell good that the did something good for another person. And then they wont have to miss the other things they love to do something like that.

Thanks for taking the time to read this letter

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
