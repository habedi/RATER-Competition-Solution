Students should have a b average to play sports.

am going to tell you why i think they should have b average to play sports. I hope you will think the same when i am done with this.

These are all my opinions why i think you should have a b average to play sports. One reason i think you should have a b average to play sports is because you cant just focus on sports you have to focus on school to. another reason i think you should have a b average to play sports is because you have to earn that privilege to play sports so if your messing up in school you shouldn't be able to play sports. The next reason is because you don't just go to school to play sports your there to get good grades then play sports.

In conclusion, those were all my opinions why i thought we should have a b average to play sports. I know not all people will agree with me but you have nothing to worry about if your playing sports and you have a b average. I really hope you considered about siding with my opinion.
