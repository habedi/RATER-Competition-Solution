Would you want to do a summer project that is either teacher-designed or student-designed? I chose a student-designed project. It gives students the choice of what type of project they actually want to do. The project they'll choose can relate to an activity they may be doing over the summer break. Also they can show their creativity and knowledge on the topic or subject.

First, by choosing the type of project you want to do, it would make you interested in doing the project. When teachers assign projects not everybody is interested in doing them. By being uninterested, they wouldn't give it their best effort. Also, being able to chose the way you do the project or the topics you select, will make it a fun and enjoyable project. Every student is different and would want to do their work differently from others. Having many topics to choose from gives a variety of projects to do.

Secondly, they can choose a project that relates to an activity they may be doing over the summer break. Having fun during summer break is what all students look forward to. They might not want to think about school work or even do it. By doing a project related to what they're doing during the summer, can make them willing to give it a try. In this way students can still enjoy their summer breaks and complete the project as well.

Lastly, students can show their creativity and knowledge in the project they give. Letting them pick their topic of the project can show the teacher their knowledge on what they've chose. By making posters, slide shows, poems, models, and even booklets can express how creative you are. Showing how much you know about the topic in your project you can make a good grade and feel successful by completing it. Even though projects can seem a little boring, creating your own the way you like it is much better.

In conclusion, having the students assign their own projects is more convenient than the teachers assigning the project. When teachers give assigned projects not all students want to do that topic. Students will have the freedom to choose their own project to do in their own way. They can make the project on anything they're interested in. In these ways students can still enjoy their summer break. While all having fun and enjoying the sun, the project is sure to be done.
