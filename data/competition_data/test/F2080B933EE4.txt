Dear Principal,

I in high school and the principal told all told all the students that we can bring my cell phone, but I can use only in lunch time or when I have free time. The principal was telling all the teachers that is a good idea for all the students in high school. Reason that all students have time to play with the cell phones, they can pay more attention all their classes and they can pass all their tests so they ca go to college.

In addition, all students don't have to stay bored in lunch or free time so they can play with the phones. for example if students can't bring phones every body tell every one that these high school in not fun that is so bored. Cell phones is not but. bring cell phones not affect no body. in all the school every body have cell phones. have cell phones so guys can texting an talk and this a communication that every body need.

on the other hand, have cell phones all students can pay more attention in their classes. most of the parents tell her or his son that if the pass all her or his classes they can get a cell phone wherever they want. so students can pay more attention they can do her or his homework, they can get good grades in high school and they can have permission to go the shopping or vacations or best her or his parents can buy a car that every guy in high school want to have a car. 85% of the students used cell phone within permission they get ISS

and the other 15% students used but is the principal can watch they.

furthermost, every student with cell phone if her or his parents tell her or him you have to pass all your test and you have to go to college next year you can get a cell phone. parents sometimes tell her or his son if they can bring a cell phone so students can say yes now the principal told all the students that every student have permission to bring a cell phones to school and just students can use it during lunch period or free time.

As you can see, bring cell phones at the school is a good reason for the school so students can get a good grade and pay more attention in classes and it is good that students can have time to relax to play with the cell phones and they not have to use the phone within permission in the school .Take your time to read this letter ,for that you do for us that we can use the cell phone.

sincerely, student
