Dear Principal,

I think it is a great idea for our students to perform community service. We always talk about why the trees aren't growing, why our grass is dying as well, and why the population isn't doing so well! There is your answer, its because we let things just sit around on the ground and it effects our environment. Whether students have better things to do they should, want to help out with our community.

It would be good for us to do research on. To see how coke cans, snack bags after snack, seeing people throwing things outside the window as they ride by. Did you know that a paper bag can effect the environment? Would you want to walk around and see trash everywhere? You see people out on the side of the roads picking things up, I think we should get out there and do the same. Some of our students, well most, don't realize that its bad for us to inhale the bad aroma. Nobody's environment is perfect, but we all know that there is always room for improvement. Our teachers, could make up a project and let us tell the class what we learned from community service?

I also think it would be great because we can set good examples for other people and show other people that you can miss out on your weekend plan every once a while and put our community first for a change. On television, we see people gathering around and planting flowers, and recycling. That is another great way to help, is to recycle. My little cousin watches "Disney Channel" and there are always shows that come on when people are picking up trash from hurricanes and things that are being polluted. There are many ways to help around, doing the simplest things, its just the thought that counts. Sometimes my little cousin and I go walking around and just to help people we pick up things, anything that we see, that is polluting the area.

I think this is a great thing to do. We can learn so many things. We always talk about how we can't wait for summer and spring to come, so we can go outside. Well while we are outside we can help and just pick up things. Maybe field trips could occur while doing this. Then, people who are really involved then maybe we can have a club. I think, honestly, this is a great thing to do. I am here to help 100%. I hope we end up doing it.
