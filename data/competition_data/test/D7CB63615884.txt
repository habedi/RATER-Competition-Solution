People use their cell phones for just about everything. Citizens on the daily, use their phones for GPS, texting, calling, social media, etc.. There are pros and cons to using cell phones while driving, also depending how you use them. But if I had to choose in between the two, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle unless there's an emergency, and here's why.

Accidents happen every day and it is very rare at times, that people make it out alive. People are dying almost every day from car accidents because of cell phones. About 30 percent of accidents involve talking, texting on cell phones. That should send a message to people saying, " Hey, stop texting and driving". When you decide to use your phone and drive, you've basically just decided to put not just you, but someone else's life at risk.

Take consideration in your passengers, pedestrians, and other people's operating a vehicle life. It does not take long to pull over or park your car to take care of whatever was so important that u had to put other lives in danger and pull your cell phone out. You need to really think about what's really important when your want to pull your phone out. And let's not just skip over the fact that is illegal. Being pulled over or caught on your phone while driving can affect you, negatively.

With driving and using your phone being against the law, if you are caught, you will get an automatic fixed penalty notice, three penalty points, and a fine. And if your license gets suspended and you continue to drive, it's an additional 6 months. So slow down and really ask yourself is this worth picking up the phone right away to text your boyfriend/girlfriend back. Is this really this time to call friends and make plans? I would say it's a lot to think about but it's not. Just do the right thing.

Imagine not making it back home to your loved ones. Imagine what you could cause and put other people through that they didn't deserve, because they were doing the right thing. Or put yourself in their shoes. Just think about it before you decide to pull your phone out and possibly cause accidents maybe death. We can prevent things happening like that if we just do the right thing. Is the cell phone worth it? That's a decision for you to make. But I would tell you, " No, we as drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle".
