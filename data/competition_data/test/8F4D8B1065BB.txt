I think that the principal should not take away sports privileges because some students are dedicated to the sports that they play and if they can't play them because there grades are to low they might drop more because the sports might help the students focus on school projects and work. If half of the students can't play in the sports they might have t forfeit the matches because shortage of players. Some of the players use sports to take there anger out on the games instead of on people and if they cant do that they might start to take there anger out on some of the students. If half of the players cant play because of there grades they might lose out on a scholarship they are trying to earn by being monitored during the games. I don't think it is fair to take away these rights from students who have trouble in school. If they are going to put a rule I think it should be "students must show effort or improvement on there grades in order to keep there individual privileges of sports and other activities". The students should not lose the rights to sports and other actvities.
