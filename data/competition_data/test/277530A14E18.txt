Should all students be required to do an extracurricular activity

What are the pro's and cons about making every student do an extracurricular activity? So requiring every student do an extracurricular activity is good if the students want to make new friends or be active, but what if the parents can't pick them up in time or can't find a baby sitter? Extracurricular activities are great for being active and not just sitting around at home watching TV or playing video games. Some students have a hard time making friends or talking to other people their age so if they are around people their age more often they will get more comfortable around them and start having conversations and making new friends. But sometimes the parents can't pick up their child, or the parents will need someone to watch their younger kids because they can't afford a baby sitter so some kids would'nt be able to do an activity.

Homework is an important role too because sometimes we have too much to do within the short period of time from when we get home to when we go to bed. By the time you eat dinner, take a shower and whatever else you need to do you don't have much time for school work, so if you add an extracurricular activity into that you only have a couple hours to do the other things. People should be able to sign up or not sign up for whatever they want. You never know what its like at their house or what they're like, so if they don't sign up for something for whatever reason just let them be.

Most kids already do things outside of school like go to basketball games, play sports, make art, ride bike, play outside, hang out with friends and a lot more things. I like to go to basketball games with my best friend or skateboard, sometimes i try to draw and i take boxing lessons. I am not signed up for any extracurricular activity through the school and i am active. The people who don't do any activities shouldn't have to sign up for anything but it would help if they did fun things on their own time.
