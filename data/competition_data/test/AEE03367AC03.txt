Being able to attend a class from home is a poor idea created by schools for students that cant attend school.

Recently schools have created online classes for students who cant attend or when the school is closed. Although some say that a student being able to attend a class from home can benefit their mental stability or there transit.

Attending a class from home promotes being lazy, allows more distractions and can take the drive out of a student.

Some other reasons would be. Not having to attend classes makes the student lazy. The students no longer have to rush to class, or wake up early. Theyre almost encouraged to become more lenient with the work. Also the classes can be completed at any given time allowing severe procrastination to kick in. Taking these online classes you begin to lose the school social life by not actually attending. A key part of any school is the meeting of friends and peers along the way but staying home all the time, you obtain little to no social in school life. knowing your teachers can bring along relationships that can help you out later in life such as a recommendation for a job. Attending from home offers more distractions. some would argue that school is the more distracting place for a student but at home your own freedom can get the best of you and lead you away from your work without someone pulling you back in.

There is a variety of reason why. Being away can free a students mind even with the stress of school.

Allowing a student to be away from their regular home lifestyle can benefit their mood as well as showing them something new in life to keep there mind creative. staying at home offers little life experiences that any kids deserves to experience. It takes away drive a student need to succeed . They no longer have to make a class a priority since they have all the time to complete it, and they begin to lose interest in trying to make sure they are doing the best they can to succeed. Taking an online class just doesnt involve you and keep you in the loop like a regular class will. It could leave you almost less knowledgeable then actually attending. You only retain the information that the online videos or prompts give you, you dont get to here the extra knowledge you could learn in a more interactive environment.

Attending a class from home can leave you lazy, finding more distractions, and it can take the drive out of you.

although some may disagree and say that online school can benefit ones stress levels and take care of housing and transit they are mistaken. Online school can and will be useful in desperate times, such as when theyre is a epidemic and schools need to close and students need to complete there classes somehow but on a note of simply not being able to attend school it can ruin the school life for someone and remove vital things it takes to be a successful adult.
