I believe that if a student can focused at home and do there work and find it more easy, then yes I think this would benefit a lot of student who can't always find a ride to school , wakes up really late, teen mom at home , or is a student who cant be in school because they got kicked out .This helps out a lot of people with situations at home or at school . I feel like if I was to take this position I wouldn't be able to forces because I get too distracted at home but if I was in school I would be more focused but for other its is different because they might think the opposite , maybe they can focus more at home and they might think coming to school is a distraction for them. I also believe that if the students dont understand what the program is showing them then there are always other resources like the video conferencing as provided . You dont nesserly have to see each other face to face and you could always ask others for help when needed in both situations.
