Are activities good or bad for you?

I am writing today about why I think that we should have extracurricular activities and why it is important to have this decisions and why it is god for you.

I agree with the decision that you should have at least one extracurricular activity because If you take the activity's like sports, band, yearbook or another activity's then you can find out what you like and do not like. It is good for you to find out what you like so you can have practice and find out you really like it. If you take a activity like sports, band, yearbook or another activity then you can find out what you like and do not like. I think that if students take a extracurricular activity then get to try new things that they have probably have not tried before. If students participate in activities they will get to meet more people that like the same things.

Students that do an extracurricular activity can be themselves and express who they are and who they what to be. If the students participate in the decision then they could help their future and find out what they want to do when they grow up. I think that if the students follow this decision they will have fun and do better in school and have more time do. what hey want to do

I predict that if students do a activity in school they will want to try more of the activities. This is a good and the students should like it that they get to have the extracurricular activities.

In conclusion I agree with this decision you should have activities to participate in,

It is good for students to try new things that they have not tried before.
