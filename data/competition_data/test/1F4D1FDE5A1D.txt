I think that we dont need to keep the Electoral College because it is not a good way for people to vote.

I think how we should vote is by a majority vote where whoever wins the popular vote from all states will win the election and become are president. So whoever gets the most votes per every state that is who will win. One reason why i dont think we need to keep the electoral college is because in the second sorce in paragragh 14 where it says "It's official:The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." It tells you that the electoral college makes it to where no matter who wins the popular vote the canidate will not win if the electoral college wants something different to happen.

"The Louisiaa legislature early succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)" i wanted to bring this up because if the Electoral Colege did what they were trying to do then Kennedy never would have been the president and who knows what the history of that presidency would be today. The electoral college is good at some times but i think that who ever wins th popular vote should automatically be the president.

In the second sorce paragraph 2 it says "What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!" According to Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but did not win the presidency because of the electoral college.

Over 60 percent of the people that vote for the president would rather have a direct election than have the electoral college becuse the electoral college does what they want and they do not listen to the people.

I just think we need to no longer use the electoral college and just go by what the people of America think will be best for this country.
