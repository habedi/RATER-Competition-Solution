I believe students can benefit from distance learning or otherwise known as "

home school".

And there are three reasons I say this. First, is you won't have to worry about being late, because, you build it around your schedule; second, are due dates. Due dates always mess up everything, because you try to focus on that one thing and end up not doing anything else. And lastly is work ethic. When doing work at home you tend to get done quicker and with less talking you can understand what exactly you're supposed to be doing.

Now we all hate having to wake up early, pick out an outfit, and do all that other nonsense five times a week for ten months. And on top of that you have to be either ready to be taken to school by parents, by bus, or by walking there yourself, which can be very upsetting most of the time. But, with home schooling you won't have to worry about missing the the bus or walking in the rain, you can just wake up do what you have to do and start your online classes for the day.

Next, s something nobody likes, the all dreadful due dates. Due dates suck, and tend to put you on edge. I know this because every other week I have a new due date for some class assignment, and it stresses me out sometimes, because the work overload can get to be to much to handle and most of the time I just can't take it all.

Lastly, is work ethic. hen you have peace and quiet or you're able to listen to music without any distractions you tend to get more work done, which is why home school is a great option. you won't have to worry about what Generic_Name told Generic_Name orÂ who stole you chocolate milk at lunch, all you have to do is focus on the work you are doing and be done.

In conclusion, home schooling is a great way to to achieve class work and other studies. This is one of the the great many plans out there to help students excel in what they need to in order to become great American people. And if it were up to me , I would choose home schooling over this messed p school system any day of the week.
