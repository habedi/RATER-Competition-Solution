Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, I am in eighth grade and a student of SCHOOL_NAME.

I feel that all students should participate in community service. I feel they should participate in community service because it would look very good on their college application. Another reason why I said all students should participate in community service is because if some of us students aren't told to do something like, pick up trash then the trash will still be sitting their until we graduate. Some students will be glad to community service and some students will refuse or as they say "buck." I feel that most students that have been doing what suppose to be doing and also has been helping around the school should be rewarded.

Some students think community service is a punishment, but it's not. I know sometimes you think picking up trash is nasty but it's not only helping you, but it's helping the community and your planet. Not all community service is picking up trash sometimes it's recycling or car pooling or even just turning off a light when you leave a room. I also think everyone should do community service because wouldn't it be nice for a change to see all students do work.

Community service to me is a change. We make changes everyday, but when we make those changes think about the world and how you should help it. If it was up to me community service would be the only options, because some students have time to come out and do community service but some chooses to go home and dent the couch, and that's just selfish. TEACHER_NAME you know when you tell us to do what we are suppose to do, it goes threw one ear and out the other. Why waste anymore time making suggestions and start making orders.

The main reason why most students to do community service is because some students go by their own well and whether do illegal stuff than do community service. This situation should be solved now!

These students are suppose to do work such as community service. If they don't do the work why bother even try to get a job. We waste entirely too much time say ," Don't do this, or don't that." Their going to do it anyways.

That's what I STUDENT_NAME think about community service.
