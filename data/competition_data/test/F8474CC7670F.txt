In the summer when schools require students to complete summer projects I think that these projects should be teacher designed, because if the projects we're students designed the projects wouldnt be as much of a learning process then if it we're a teachers designed project.

first of all why I think that summer projects should be designed by teachers is the learning process of the project. Projects are for students to show what they know and learn more about what they have to research and they would have to take more time in finding factual research about their topics. This is good for students in the summer because it keeps them intact with school in some shape of form and it would keep the students occupied rather than them playing video games, or doing some other thing that rots their brain. To add on by teachers giving out projects in the summer will also benefit the students as well. For example my cousin Adam who lives in newyork was enjoying his summer like any other teen would do, well while he was doing what he was interested in doing he also did not something school related all summer such as reading, researching etc this also too a toll on him because since he wasnt doing anything school related over summer he began to lose focus more in school.

Secondly, why I think teacher should be designing projects in the summer is that it gives them something to do while just doing nothing all summer long. Students could be doing things completely different from school during the summer days, by teachers giving out projects could possibly keep students out of trouble during the summer and it also get their next year of school started off to a great start by them doing the projects. Also by teachers hand out projects in the summer shows that they truly care about their students education and would love to see them succeed and expand their knowledge furthermore.

My third reasoning on why I think ti should be the teachers who design the summer projects is that they are not likely to do projects if they had to design it them self. To add on for example if students were allowed to design their own projects they would most certainly become less focus because they would feel like they wouldnt have to do the project as much or take as serious because they're the ones designing it and not the teachers. By the students designing their own summer projects and most likely not doing could really hurt their school life and their start off grade for the start of the new school year.

Although, some may say that students should be able to design their own summer projects because it allows them to show the teachers what they can do by them self, also lets students work at their own past, and wont overwhelm the students because they get to design anything i their choice. This may be true but like I said before students tend to lose interest and focus more quickly if they seem that the task isnt as important to them. So by teachers designing these summer projects would make it seem more important to the students and it would make them want to do it even more and get benefits out of it.
