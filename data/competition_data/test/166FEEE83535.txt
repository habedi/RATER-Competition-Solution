Luke was 18 years old. He just finished his high school graduation. Luke had two jobs working at a grocery store and at a bank, until his life cahnged.

Luke's friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime. World War II just ended and a lot of countries needed help, so Luke and his friend started to help. The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of all of the animals that would be on the boat. Luke and Don then signed up.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Luke was happy that he was helping people but he was also really excited to see Europe and China. Luke also went to Venice, Italy and he even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy really helped and prepared him for this hard work that he is doing today. Then soon enough, Luke got a new job on the boat. Luke's job was check on all the animals every hour.

Then one night Luke's life almost ended. Luke was going to go see the captain but he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke almost flew overboard but a metal along the edge stopped him.

Luke had fun on board also. The cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

Luke was happy for what he has done. It made Luke more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness always stayed with him. Luke saved peoples lives. Luke is a hero.
