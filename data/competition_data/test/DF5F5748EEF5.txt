Dear Principal,

I think Student should clean up litter because its good for the comminute, good for the environment, and other things. I'm telling you why people should pick up litter.

The first reason is that its good for the comminute. I mean really who wants to sit in a dirty school that has germs and other bad stuff. I wouldn't like that at all because i like to be a clean person and that is just gross to be at a school that hasn't been cleaned up since who knows when.

The second reason is that its good for the environment. It would be nice if people would clean up the environment because I like to see trees and animals but what i don't like is died trees and animals because what people through out of there car window for example soda rings those can kill a lot of animals.

The third reason is that it good for people to do. Like what I just said its good for both comminute and environment. It gets people active and going and its some thing to do when your bored.

That is why I think students should clean up litter. They are helping the comminute, environment, and the trees and the animals. Thank you principal for all your time.

Thank you,
