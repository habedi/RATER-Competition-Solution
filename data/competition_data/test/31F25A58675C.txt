Im against this driveless car thing. Why would u want to have that kinda car to have but you reallycant drive it unless it tells u can. I see they point of when are coming from but personal i would have to say no.

The reason i saw no is becasue i like to drive and i have some reason why i think it not good. First reason is because what happen when ur in the car and when its driving it self down the road you may what to take a nap and your by yourself. Then whe nthe car is driving and it makes a mishap then your in trouble because its your car and you have to pay for it to get fix. The second reason is that when you think for awhile because in the passage it says " Toyata prisu uses posisiton-estimatingon th eleft rear wheel, a roating sensoron the roof, a vidoe camera mountes near the rearview mirrior, four automative radar sensprs, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor." Just because it has all those thing dosent mean it good to have a driverless car. What happens if one of those thing break down and next thing you know you dont have a sensors on the left rear wheel then what happen you crash. The thrid reason is because when are in the car to my personal reaction i want to be safe and want to be on the wheel and not have to car be pushing my gas pedel. What happens and the car gose to fast or to slow and since you have no control of what the car dose then it stil your fault to be in a crash with another car or in the ditch. When im in a car i like to be the one on the gas pedel and to be able to, control my car and not have it go automacly. It says in the passage " in 2013, BMW announced the development of Traffic jam Assistant." The car can handle driving functional at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sesors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." I also say " They cansteer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the raod ahead requires human skills, such as navitgating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. his necessitates the car beign ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a promble occurs." Hoe would the driver be noticefy that there was a promble hhow can the car do that if thye wold tell me why then i would understand and maybe be on there side.

That what i have to say about this driverless car i am not likeing the idea so when have to be ready to have a car be on the crash you will be in the promble to be able to get the money on how they would pay there car. So there one im not on there side at all.
