Ok I see where this article is coming from with the FACS technology,but if you think about it,theres some people out there who probably wouldn't want to be read about there emotions.

Realy if you think about it what do people gain from this technology. In the article it talks about how you can tell by the look of peoples faces you can tell how that friend is feeling. If a person can tell how someone is feeling just by the way they look then what is the point of this tecnology. Also in the article it gives you a number of steps to do while looking in the mirror in paragraph 7,but all of those steps are thing they people can detect already from other people instead of a the FACS techgnology.

Some things are useful in this tecnology,but its just really doesn't show any value on how this can effect other people. This tecnology is really just to show you there emotion,nut in reality ask your self what can you do depending on what ther emotions are showing, for the person who is feeling this way? So in my conclusion this technology to read the emtional exspressions of students in the classroom is not valuable.
