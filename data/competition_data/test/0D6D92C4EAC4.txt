Dear Mrs. Principal,

I think you should use Policy 1.

I feel that it is a much better decision than Policy 2.

Students bring their phones to class anyway, so even if you do try to enforce Policy 2 it will not work.

I find it pointless to not be able to have phones in school.

Someone's mom may be in the hospital, and that person's family may be trying to get a hold of them, but they wouldn't be able to because that student wouldn't have their phone.

People should also be able to know if something comes up, and they won't be able to have their normal ride home.

In Policy 2, I feel that it would be a much safer way to be in school.

It's surprising what all can happen in people's lives outside of school, and the students should be informed!

Some kids have after school activities too.

They need a phone to keep in touch with the person that is said to pick them up after their activity ends.

Plus, teachers have their phones on in class.

We should at least be able to have them on in off periods.

I do think that if students have their phones on, they should automatically be put on silent or vibrate.

There should be some punishment if a phone does go off in class, however.

This punishment shouldn't be too bad.

I don't think it is right for a teacher to take a kids phone if it goes off because no one that I know ever cheats.

They should simply just tell them to turn it off and go on with their teaching.

Most of the time, the student is just texting their mom asking for them to bring in a project or their lunch that they left on the counter.

If a teacher tried to take my phone, I wouldn't give it to them.

Having my phone on me makes me feel safe and secure.

I always like to feel like I know what is going on with my family out of school.

Having a phone lets me be informed.

Also, if I'm feeling bad I can just call my mom to pick me up so I don't have to wait in the nurses office.

Cell phones are like my security blanket; I couldn't live without it.

Policy 2 is the best policy by far, and I believe that any kid would agree with me on that.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
