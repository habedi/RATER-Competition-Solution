The planet Venus is inhospitable at its current state, but is it worth it to find out the truth? Scientists tell us that Venus is averaging temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. Venus has been unexplorable due to these factors with the last mission failing in a few hours, but is it worth the risk? The idea of pursuing Venus is dangerous, but can be worth it to find more about how the geography was similar to earth, and if Venus could ever support life again.

Venus is called Earth's sister planet because it is the closest planet to Earth in density, size, and distance. Humans have tried to explore Venus many times in the past but have all failed due to the intense temperature and pressure of the planet. The planet also has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide which makes it even more challenging to visit. Despite these factors, why do scientists want to visit this deadly planet? Scientists are very infatuated with this planet because it used to be just like earth from a geography standpoint. The planet was covered with large oceans, rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. These are more than enough reasons for scientists to explore Venus because they want to learn more about what occured for the planet to transform from the earth like place. Scientists need to learn more about Venus so they can learn more about our planet too. They are working on ways to observe the planet while being able to come back alive. NASA has developed an interesting idea to send humans to study venus. They want to study Venus by hovering above the planet just like planes fly over storms. This idea would keep humans away from the harmful things Venus has to offer, but there are some down sides to this idea. Observing Venus from above can only do so much for us. Light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, so insight into the ground life of Venus is limited. The biggest down side is the fact that researchers cannot take samples of Venus such as rock and grass back to earth to study. This idea is still better than nothing because anything we learn from this mission is something we did not know before.

The age old question that most people have on planets is "could they ever inhabit life again?" Scientists have studied planets for many years and have seen a variety of things. They have concluded that Mars will be able to inhabit life and have started a program where sign ups are available to leave Earth to help scientists conduct an experiment for life. Venus once held many characteristics similar to earth, but the most important one is that many years ago Venus could have supported a variety of life. The question is what changed? Venus has very hot temperatures and high pressures so it is difficult for scientists to get up close and take samples to study. Scientists are working on different ways to study Venus where they can get closer to take samples. NASA has used some simple electronics made of silicon carbide and simulated it in the chaotic conditions of Venus and it survived for three weeks. This is important because they can use these electronics to send them into the atmosphere of Venus and take pictures and samples from the planet until they find an alternate solution to getting humans past that thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. Scientists also thought of reverting back to mechanical computers to go into the atmosphere. This could work because things that use mechanical parts tend to do better in conditions of high pressure, heat, and other limiting factors. These things could be worth it to the people of Earth because if we determine a way to put life on Venus, the whole world would change.

The idea of Venus' geography being very similar to Earth's and the fact that it could have supported life makes it worth it to study venus despite the dangers that come with it. Venus used to have oceans. mountains, and valleys just like earth, but have no idea what happened to all of those things which make them want to study the planet even more. Life could have been supported long ago and scientists are working to discover a way around the limiting factors to figure out if it could ever be supported again. Scientists are doing everything they possibly can to study Venus and it is only a matter of time before we have the answers we seek.
