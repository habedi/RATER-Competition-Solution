Why we can do what we want after hours.

By Generic_Name,

The idea of a mandatory after school or extracurricular activity is filled with huge flaws. From angry parents to legal trouble, this is me, "pouring gasoline onto the fire."

1. Its a simple idea really. Make kids participate in extracurricular activities against their wills. More money to the school and things that college will look back on and say,

"You were in the yearbook club in 8th grade, congratulations welcome to Harvard!"

In fact collages dont look at most things from middle school, colleges dont really care because middle school dost have college counting courses till about 8th grade. The things they look at are your activities in high school and your grades in high school along with your SATs. This means that depending on the school (middle or high school) this would be for no good reason than to give kids experience and make people pay money for their kids to participate in these extracurricular activities.

2. This will make parents and kids mad. The addition of extracurricular activities means the violation of rights and possible putting people at health risks. Think about it, you miss a doctors appointment because you have to do this or suffer for not attending. You could have people with diabetes not have to correct things to eat after the extracurricular activity running them the risk of high or low blood sugar. Heart and lung conditions also. Its not good.

3. Timing will be off put, if your already part of a sports team and try to balance two of them at once the intersecting times will get you in trouble on both side and will let your team down. Traffic will now be a problem considering students getting back near 5 or 6 and getting out in rush hour traffic. Meaning they get home later and and wont have enough time to work on important work they need for school. Not to mention not everybody can even attend after hour activities, doctors appointments, travel, family matters. This will spiral out of control fast causing parents and students alike to start taking action against the school.

4. A revolt will happen, I'm making this sound dramatic but it will. It will start with a majority of people saying "this is stupid" and not attending these extracurricular activities. This will start taking effect with everyone and now a lot of people will start leaving the extra curricular activities. Then you have to face the parents, very angry and annoyed phone calls saying "I cant pay for this!" or "We have no time on our schedule to deal with this!" Eventually if the mandatory extracurricular activities dont end or become optional. Parents will probably start filling complaints to the school board or Virginia legislators. Did i mention that keeping kids at school after hours against their will is literary kidnapping. An offense of the law. So this will end two ways, cancellation of the mandatory extracurricular actives by the school board or by VA legislation, or parents pulling their kids out of the school successfully lowering the productivity, ranking, and reputation of the school.

So after all of that, do you think its a good idea to make extracurricular activities mandatory? Ill lat you think about it.
