Dear principal TEACHER_NAME,

Most students spend their time and weekends texting, visiting friends, watching television, going to parties and getting into trouble. I believe that all students should be required to perform community service. Being active participants of community service will help students stay or become well rounded. Community service could better the way our towns and cities look. It would also give student an idea of what they would be required to do in high school and college.

I believe community service is a positive influence on all students. Just because it would take up some of students time doesn't mean it will take up all of their time.

Many students are lazy and complain they have nothing to do, if those same students could put there time and effort towards community service their perspectives would be changed. Community service wouldn't only change our community, but it would also change students and the way they view our environment.

Pushing for a change,

STUDENT_NAME
