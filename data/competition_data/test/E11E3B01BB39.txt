The author claims that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because venus might once have been like earth and could be visited in the future. In the article the author gives information about the planet, why scientists want to study it, and possible approaches on studying venus.

In paragraph 4 the article says, "Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." It then goes on to say, "Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth." In order to study Venus, NASA is coming up with ways to study Venus without risking any lives. One such example is a vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above Venus's surface. Another method is simplified electronics that have been tested in Venus-like conditions.

In conclusion, humans may soon be able to study Venus more closely and maybe one day put humans on the Evening Star. It is yet to be known when this might happen but with new technology, or maybe old technology, it is a possibility not worth giving up on.
