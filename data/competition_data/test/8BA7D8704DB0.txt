The new FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could help out in a classroom setting. This software could help teachers make class work that keeps kids intrested and ingaged. The software could also help teachers know which students need help, both in class and out of class.

The FACS software works using the 44 major muscles in the human face to identify "6 basic emotions; happiness, suprise,anger, disgust, fear,and sadness." The computer will make "a 3-D model of the face" of all 44 major muscles. Then as the actual person moves their face the program will measure the emotion they are showing. In a classroom setting this can be used to see if a child is intrested or confused about what they are learning. Then could potentaly "modify the lesson" or notify a teacher that said student was confused or bored during the lesson. This software could also help detect if a student is depressed. If a student if going through something mentally the software can "indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one." If the computer is showing that a student is showing a lot of sad or forced facial expressions then it could notify the teacher. Then the teacher could try to help that student with whatever it is that might be troubling them.

Adding FACS to school settings would help teachers teach at the right pace, keep students on task, even help students become smarter. By reading a students emotions the teachers can help in so many ways. Schools should look into adding a system like FACS into classrooms.
