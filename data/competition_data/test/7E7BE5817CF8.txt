Students work extremely hard on their grades; they study, pay attention in class, and turn in their work on time. My Principal is wanting to change school policies to were only students with at least a grade B average can go to school events, but I am against that. Most students have a grade C average, and they've worked hard to get that. They study just as much as a student with a grade B average. Let me tell you the reasons why I am against changing the school policies.

First of all, students with a grade C average study exquisitely hard on their class work just as much as students with a grade B or A average. I think that it wouldn't be fair to them when a student studied exactly the same as a student with a higher grade average, and doesn't get the same reward. Most students participate the same as others and don't get treated the same way.

Additionally, some students can't remember as much information as other students. IN my opinion, students with a grade C average may study the same amount as students with a higher grade average. They just don't have the same memory strength; some students may have short term memory, but work hard to keep up the good work.

Lastly, students shouldn't be treated differently, because of their grade average. They shouldn't even be treated differently at all! The students with a grade C average are just as talented as others with a higher average. It would make the grade C average student think that they're not worth it. " It" as in not worth being rewarded with how much talent they put into their work.

To sum it up, all students with at least a grade C average should be able to participate in school events. They study and work as hard; also, they put in the same effort. Students shouldn't be treated differently on how smart they are, they should be treated on who they are, no matter if they have the lowest grade average in their group. In my opinion, students who put the same effort in their work as students with a higher grade average should be rewarded as the "smarter" students would be
