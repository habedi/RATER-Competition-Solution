Teachers should design the summer projects for a mulitude of reasons one being they know what was taught this year so they know what level the students are at, they know what the students will need to know for next year, and students tend to slack off during the summer and that would negatively affect the project.

The teachers know what level the students are at and they taught them what they already know. So the project would be specifically designed for them and what they already know. It would be a helpful review for those who tend to forget what they learned last year over the summer. Some of the classes that students take the next year are a build upon on what they learned the last year. For example, Algebra one is the basis for Algebra 2 so that information can not be forgotten. Having the teachers design not only will be a good review for the students. But it will also help prepare them for the following classes.

Whether it is because they also teach that class, or the class is a continuation of what was learned the following year, or they know about the subject of their own volition, or the next year teacher talked to them about it. Teachers know what students are going to be learning next year. So they would know best about what students should be learning about in the summer to get prepared. It is always nice to get a head start on what is going to be learned next year. The students can figure out what they are struggling with now and start researching it and practicing it now so that they don't struggle with it throughout the school year. They can start developing questions now for their teachers and start developing an interest in the subject. It not only helps the students but also the teachers. During the school year the teachers will be able to move more quickly through their curriculum because the students already have a understanding of it.

During the summer students sleep, eat, watch tv, and play outside in the heat. They don't come up with project designs. If they do it's losely put together and later in the summer. There should be a pre-designed project during the summer by the teachers. Not something students freely choose when they think of it. Plus it would take a chunk out of their working time to have to come up with a idea for a project, not everyone is creative enough to come up with a project, and procrastination will most likely occur espicially if students don't have a basis for the project. If they don't know the beginning they can't come up with the ending referring to the project.

The projects should be designed by teachers because they know the previous information learned by students, what the students will be learning next year, and students slack off in the summer because they want to relax. It has been proven that it not only would help students by decreasig their struggle with the information and so on. That it will also help the teachers next year by increasing the rate at which the information is blown through. Having the teachers design it will prepare students for the next year and give them a nice review from the last year. That is why teachers should design it because the have the tools to provide the following for students.
