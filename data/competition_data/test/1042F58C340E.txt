Hello,I am an astronomer at NASA. I am here to discuss that the "face" discovored in Mars is FAKE.

My reason that the "face" discovered in Mars is fake because the area where the "face" was discovored (Cydonia) has stroms their a lot and snow. So, there is a possibility that it was huge landform and the weather wore off the the landform to the point where it was a face. About a month ago we have released the picture in a JPL web site, revealing that the "face" is just another landform.

As of right now we are trying to look at the "face" to look and conclude it is another Landform and not "aliens". we have also found that the landmass is the bottleneck of a volcano so maybe in a few years it will erupt and prove that it's not a face.

Yes, we have made history by taking one little picture that we can't even look at it. If you wanna look at the "face" just look up these coordinates. 41 degrees north martian latitude. maybe you will see it as a landform and not a face.

This the astronomer at NASA, and this me proving that this landform is not a "face". thank you for your time to reading this and goodbye. By the way it is a mesa.
