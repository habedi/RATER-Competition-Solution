Dear TEACHER_NAME

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i' m against you for trying to make it where student can't play sports with out a B average. The reason why is student work hard at school they still do they work but it hard maintain a B average for student even for the ones that do not play sports. I should know i run track for SCHOOL_NAME and i have an A, B, C average in SCHOOL_NAME and it is tough to keep that average. Yes you feel we can do better but not half the student in all the united states can not make a B average . The reason I can cause i put my study time in class or at break or sometime at PE and expository classes. Some student do not get the help i do but keep their average at a C witch is still difficult to do for me and other fellow student in the united states. Think back when you played sports in middle school and high school was it difficult for you or not. I feel you would get a lot more grade pull ups if slack down the grade positioning just to play sports. you said you can still past with a D average, but we can't play sports with a C average. It not right for student who work hard in subjects that they are really learning for the first time and their pasting higher than the ones who past with D averages. So please TEACHER_NAME do not make where student that play sports have to make a B average just to play sports.

Sincerely a

SCHOOL_NAME student
