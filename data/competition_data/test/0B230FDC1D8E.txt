In the story, the author talks about why Venus is a plant that NASA would love to study and know more about, but its very difficult to do that with alot of difficulties and challenges to face wanting the ability to know more about the Planet.

In Paragraph 3 the author talks about The planets surface and temperatures. One reason why it would be difficult to land on Venus, is because the temperatures avarage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atmosphere is 90 times greater than what humans on planet earth ever experienced. The author also states that in his words by saying "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth". Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system, meaning our sister planet is one of the hottest plants in our solar system by far.

Another reason why it would be difficult to land on Venus and study the planet, because in past missions no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Thats a good reason why spacecrafts havent landed on Venus to get the ability to study the planet in more than three decades. In Paragraph 3, the author also states that in his words, "A thick atmosphere of almos 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere". The author also says that weather present additional impediments like powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning strikes and erupting volcanoses seeking the land on the surface.
