This shows that a student can gain time management skills because they are able to get basic house work done and at the same time prioritize school work.

However, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to internal skills a student will achieve like productivity, time management, and responsibility. Additionally, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to external benefits like a chance at higher grades, less distractions, and being able to work ahead. Students should understand taking classes from home can argued as one of the greatest advances in today's society.
