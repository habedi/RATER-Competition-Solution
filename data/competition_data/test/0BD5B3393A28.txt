i think technology that reads facial expressions of emotions of students in the classroom is not valuble. if a student is happy, sad, angry, etc they know what to do to make it change.

technology isnt always right anyways so if the computer reads that someone is happy and they are actually sad then nobody could help that student out. also if a student is confused they have to figure it out on there own or ask someone for help they know how to do that on there own and if there board then they can figure out what to do to get movin and to be happy instead of being board the hole time.

lets say we want to have computers to show the emotions that might be a bad thing like if your opening a present you got and you dont like it that could hurt that persons feeligs and make them sad. so no i do not think its a good thing to have computers tell our emotions.
