In this article I think that using computers to read students facial expressions is a great idea for students in a classroom. It could solve alot of problem that need to be adressed.

In chapter six it states Imagine a computers that know when you are sad or happy.

That right there is something that could help teachers out becuase it could bring up a problem in the classroom they might not see right awayor to help them.

The computer can also detect if a student is getting bored or confused, that is another thing that could help the staff go see what the problem is.

This type of technology could help so many problems going on during school hours, like helping kids if they dont get a subject or dont understand how to do a assignment.

This could also raise the understanding of facial expressions.

In chapter nine in claims that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also helps produces them.

This ends my claim and this is a very productive way to help schools out and other place to.
