I had so much fun and amazing expirences being a Seagoing Cowboy. Maybe you should try it sometime. I have many reasons why. I will put them down below.

In this expirence, I got to help people. I have also crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by the World War II. It feels nice to get to help people for free. It makes me feel like a good person. Maybe you should try this. It is also fun on board. The text states, " Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips aftr the animals have been unloaded. "

Maybe if you gave being a Seagoing Cowboy a try, it might help your future. Also you might even have a story like this one made from it. Give it a swing! Maybe you will encourage others after you tried. It does not hurt to try!
