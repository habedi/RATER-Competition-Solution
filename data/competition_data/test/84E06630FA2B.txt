Well, if i'm being honest with you. I do not believe it is a good thing to do. In certain states, yes. But when it comes to school and kids' education? No. If you put these kinds of computers in schools, all they would do is distract the kids and make them focus on what the computer is doing itself instead of the work. Sure, it can read when you're bored or unhappy. But that doesn't mean it's alright to distract the kids from doing their work.

Alright, so i think it's cool that a computer can tell emotions and how you are feeling and this and that. But in all reality it is just another electronic thing that we do not need in the world. Every year, people and companies come out with more and more stupid ideas for electronics. All i am hearing on TV anymore is about the new iPhones or the new Mac Books. They are cool and all, but you literally just came out with a new one last year. Like it says in the story, "Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."

In conclusion, these new tech designs and programs and electronics are pointless and unuseable. There is no point in putting something in a school that will just distract the kids from learning. Maybe having them at popular restaurants and stuff would help. But in schools? No way. Kids nowadays have a hard enough time learning in school, putting these computers in the schools is not going to help them learn anything quicker.
