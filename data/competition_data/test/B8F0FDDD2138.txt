In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" it says "Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. However it is misleading since Venus is actually a planet." Although people think Venus is a star it is a good idea for someone to study it because not that many people have that much Knoledge on it.

"If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface?" People are discussing visiting the planet because no one has visited it in 3 decades and it has probably changed. In the article it says "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." If someone could go visit Venus and see how it looks now and see if Venus could still have some type of life form on it now. Also they should take people to Venus and see how long they can live there.

In conclusion, even though numeros space crafts have been sent up to Venus the and have not compleeted their mision they still should go to venus and test if it is safe for humans to be on or go to.
