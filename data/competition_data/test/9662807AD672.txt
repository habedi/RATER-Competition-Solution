Dear Principle,

I think it is very important to perform community service.

It means that our school is involved in the environment.

If there is litter in our school, some of the kids could help clean it up.

It would make our school more presentable.

I think it should be an option and maybe there would be a reward at the end of the year for the person that performed the most acts of community service.

Some people actually like to perform acts of service because it makes them feel good about themselves.

They like the feeling of helping someone out.

It gives them a certain feeling inside.

It gives them great satisfaction to realize the job that they did.

On the other hand, some people are selfish and they don't like to help those in need.

They have other commitments that maybe are more important.

Other activities also take time and commitment and maybe performing community service is too much.

They would much rather hang out with friends and do other things rather than help the environment.

I think we should take time out of our day to look around our surroundings and see if we see any trash laying around.

If so, we would take a minute to stop and look around.

These little acts of service mean so much.

Even though they are so little, they can lead to something big.

Whatever you decide to do, I am fine with.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration on this subject.

Sincerely,
