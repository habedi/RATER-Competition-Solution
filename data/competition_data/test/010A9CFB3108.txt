Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should let students have cell phones on campus. For instance a student is walking home and they get kidnapped and they don't have a cell phone with them, who are they going to do. Second of all, many parents give their child a cell phone because what if an emergency happened and they have no phone, who's fault is it going to be, the parents. Last of all, students think that having a cell phone is cool thing to have because they can talk to their friends and on the internet.

My opinion on having a cell phone at school is that their are many cases of kidnapping when kids are walking to and from school. But the school board think that it is not right to have a cell on school campus even if its off, because they think kids are going to disobey the rule and turn them on.

Many parents cant get a hold of their children because they have no cell phone. what if their older brother or sister gets into a car accident, how are they going to contact their son or daughter. Their are many cases of children getting lost and they can't contact any body. Many principals think that a child's family may not get into a car accident because car accidents often happen during party year and family occasions.

We all know that students cannot have cell phones on school campuses, but they all disobey the rule. Many students cheat from their cell phones because they text their friends for the answers. Many students just use phones just to text their friends because either they are bored or they are planning something.

Many students do the same things all over the world, but having a cell phone is a privilege not a right. I think that students should ask their principal if they can have cell phones on school grounds, and if they turn it on inside school grounds then the privilege is taken away.
