The Facial Action coding system is a new software that can tell what peopls emotions are when they are trying to hide them. In the "Making Mona Lisa Smile" article they could find the percent of emtion the artist was feeling just by the way the picture was painted. Do you think its okay to use this sysem in a school setting?

I think its okay to use it in a school setting because it can see the true emotions the students feel. "For instance, you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble acually decribing each facial trate that conveys happy" I thinks its a good idea to have because, some kids really suffer from deppersion and sadness and this computer program can help them get the help they need and to be happy again.

Next, what the computers can do is crazy, they can read your emotional expressions when you are trying to hide them. "Using video imagery, the new emotions-recognition software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or in painted face of Mona Lisa." These computers can read everyones exact emotions.

This coding system could help many schools and students in many diffrent ways. This device could be in the schools psychologists office or in the schools guidence office and the kids could go there to get there face expressions done once a month and if it keeps comig back sad then they could go get the help they need to be happy.

In conclusion I am all for the use of this technology in a school setting. It can help each indivitual in a diffrent way. If someone is feeling sad or deppressed and dosent want to tell anyone then the Facial Action Coding System could help them be happy again.
