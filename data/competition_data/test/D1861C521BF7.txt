Do you remember the first day you got your license? I know I do, and now with all the technology they're trying to make cars that drive themselves. Drivless cars would be fun and all, but how are they going to help us? How are they going to hurt us?

Getting my licese was the best day of my life. I finally knew that I had freedom to go out and drive and have control of what I wanted to do. They're trying to manufacture driveless cars, and I don't see it doing anything but causing problems. There is a lot of responsibility with driving and if this "Driveless Car" crashes, who's fault is it? It shouldn't be the drivers fault, and I don't think manufacturerers are going to take the blame for a malfuncton in the car either.

Driving has never been a real problem in the past for anyone. Yeah there is an occasional wreck or a tragedy, but the only real problem that driving has had is people driving under the influence. If these driveless cars do become a thing, I can see way more people driving under the influence because they don't have to have complete control of the car, then who is responsible for the wreck? The car that is supposed to drive itself, or the impaired driver?

Car prices have gone up over the last few years, and not just in a slight change. Cars used to be reasonably cheap and now with all the technology the companies are putting in the cars the prices have sky-rocketed. The only thing that this driveless car is going to do is push the prices of vehicles up even more, and some people as it is already can't afford cars.

Finally, driveless cars are going to put people out of jobs. There are taxi drivers that drive people around to make money off of it, now what are they supposed to do? Truckers are supposed to transport goods around the nation to big cities, now what are they going to do?

In conclusion, I do not think that driveless cars are a good thing to have in the future, I can just see them causing a lot of problems to everyone in places where they are allowed. Car companies are making driving way to complex as it is, so why would they make a car that drives itself? There is an old saying, "if it isn't broke, don't fix it." Driveless cars in my opinion are not somethign we need in today's world, or anytime in the world.
