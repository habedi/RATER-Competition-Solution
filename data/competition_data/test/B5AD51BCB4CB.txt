In 1976 the Viking 1 aircraft that circled and took pictures of mars looking for potential landing sports for future aircrafts found a shaodwly likeness of a human face on mars. Some scientists believed it to be unnatural and made by ancient civilization on mars. The more reasonable option was that it was just another Martian mesa which are commonly found on the part of mars called Cydonia.

Nasa has proven the face on Mars to be a butte or mesa, common landforms that are found on Earth. On April 5th, 1998 the aircraft Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The Mars Orbiter Camera team or MOC took a picture with a way higher amount of resolution than the first one. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."

Even after proving the public wrong about this conspiracy many were still not satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter on Mars at the time when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Therefore some people believed that the alien markings were hidden by the clouds.

On April 8th, 2001 whatever hope people had that the Martian face was made by aliens Nasa threw away. "It was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look." The MOC team took an extraordinary photo of the face a million times better than the past two. "What the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West."

In conclusion The conspiracy on The Face On Mars was yet only a conspiracy and proven so by Nasa. The picture only showed the equivalent of a butte or mesa according to Nasa, thanks to the Mars Global Surveyor which took a picture in maximum resolution. "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."
