Limiting car usage will help decrease pollution, increase physical exercise, and relieve stress. All around the world, but mainly in Europe suburben communnites are limiting car usage. This has become a popular to do in Bogota, where communties are having mini car-free holidays.

The less people rely on cars the more walking they will do. In the passage "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in botoga" Andrew Selsky explains "Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday. This supports that limting car usage could have a healthy benefit. More exercise for people also means less stress.

Walking is a stress reliver. This is why limiting car usage is physically and mentally good for people. Andrew Selsky supports this claim by saying that "It's a good opportunnity to take away stress and lower air pollution".

Limiting the usage of cars can reduce the amount of pollution on earth. In the passage "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", Elisabeth Rosenthal informs us that "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent In some car-intensive areas in the United states". Limitting car usage is like killing multiple birds with one stone.
