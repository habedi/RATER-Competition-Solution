In "The challenge of Exploring Venus", we are faced with another difficult task. We have had many hard task in our past space wise, from our first step on the moon, to the discovery of Pluto being a dwarf planet. Studying Venus closely is a worthy pursuit because, it's a challenge and who doesn't like a challenge, it would be a exploration many people from generations old and new would like rake on themselves, and possibly we could find a way to live on a planet other than Earth.

Exploring Venus is going to be extremely challenging. For example, the passage says "Venus has the hottest surfqace temperature of any planet in our solar system." This place is going to to be extremely hard to get close to because of the heat. We can't even take pictures because "most forms of light cannot penetrate the atmosphere." Our most high-tech cameras can't even get a decent picture of the surface of Venus.

Many people from the new and old generation are obbssed with space and everything to do with it. Our workers at NASA have created electronics that have been designed to last on Venus and they have survived weels in the harsh terrain. NASA is constantly discovering something new about space. They are even using designs from the past like our "mechnical computers." They are using the design of mechanical computers because the are very durabole under harsh conditions, which is what we're gonna need in order to explore Venus.

The planet Venus is very much like Earth. There are so many energy resources there. "Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels." That is great because if we lived on Venus we wouldn't have to worry about pollutting the planets as quickly as we have done on Earth. Also, we would be able to spread the electricity widely throughout the palnet.

In conclusion, exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit for many reasons. We are going to get there one day with the way our space administrations are working. There is so much we don't know about the planets in our solar system, even our own planet. We should take the opportunity to explore whatever we can as soon as we can. That way we won't go extintic like many thing in our world.
