dear principal,

I think students should be able to bring there cell phones to school and use them on free times cause suppose it is a emergency from your parents and they want to get in contact with you at least they know you have a cell phone the reason i agree with policy one is because in case of an emergency , you just want to listen to music on your free time or you just want to have your phone with you.

In case of an emergency you will have a phone to contact your parent or guardian or your parent or guardian can contact you suppose the school was on fire you would want to let your parents no about it so you can just call them on your cell phone or any other minor injuries you can just aware them about it.

On free time most students will want to listen to music if there bored and some teachers may not understand but music helps a lot of teenagers now a days to concentrate and it can also help you focus but its not that bad you can listen to your music on free time.

Music is one of the things most of teenagers like to listen to so i think we should have cell phones allowed at our school

Most teenagers just like to have there phone with them at all times so they can show everyone or just for them to have like if you want to know the time and the television is off in the classroom you can just look on your phone and if your parents are trying to text you something like saying don't ride the bus today it can be very helpful to have your phone .

A lot of teenagers love having there cell phones so i think policy 1 is really good because of emergencies or any sort of injures or anything you can have your phone with you at all times to call up your parents or who ever you call you so i hope everyone else would agree on policy 1
