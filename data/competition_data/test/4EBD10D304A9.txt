Dear Principal,

Did you know that 90% of student play sports? Well I did and most of the students that play sports at school play with a grade c average. So changing the rules so that only students with a grade b average is not a good idea. My first reason why I believe its a bad idea is because most students play sports and their grades go up. My second reason is that sports is good and healty for kids. My third reason is that students grades stay good while their playing sports.

My first reason why i think students can play sports with a grade c average is that most students who play sports play sports and their grades go up. Student tend to do better in class so the can continue play sports at school because they know that if their grades drop that they would be unable to play sports. Students also try harder to keep good grades so they can prove that they are also good in school.

My second reason is that sports are good and healthy for the students. For most student sports are the only way for them to stay in shape physically but if some students don't have a grade b average then its going to be hard for them to stay in shape because their grades are bad. Also when student play sports at school they usually have more energy for school so they are more pumped at school.

My third reason is that grades stay good. Students usually keep their grades up because they want to continue playing sports. Students become more focus when they are in school because they don't want to fail a class and get kicked of their sport's team. They also try harder to maintain their grades so they can play sports. There grades also become higher then they were because they want to keep on playing sports.
