Dear Principal,

I would just like to tell you my opinion about community service. I think that you should require all students to perform community service. I think that it would be a good idea because there's always people in the world that would love to have help from other people and also just making the community nicer, and cleaner. I think most kids our age would rather go home and go to sleep, or just go home and watch television, but I think community service would really help the community a lot. You should have flyers all around the school telling kids to do community service. I bet if it seemed fun to do, than maybe they would like to. Most kids would probably do community service because there friends were doing it with them, that would also inspire kids to help out a lot if they were doing it with there friends. For some people, they already have to do community service for religion, and other things, but i still think you should make community service seem fun, so kids would actually want to be a part of it. You should also go around to all the teachers and tell the teachers to talk to their students about helping out. Sometimes, if you hear something from your favorite teacher you would like to do it. Well, at least that's what i have to say. I strongly believe that kids in our school would love to do community service, it would probably make them feel better about themselves because they either helped out someone, or helped out something. Just spending a half an hour on community service two or three times a week could make a big change for the environment. Also, when kids do community service, they could also be helping a little kid do better in school and that's a very kind thing to do. I just think telling you this would change things in our school and also change things in other peoples lives. If kids just did community service for about 2 hours every time they do, they could still go home after and do what they want or need to do. Well, I hope you take my advice. I believe that it would be an amazing thing to do for people around the world. That's all i have to say! Have a good day.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
