Dear Principal of SCHOOL_NAME,

As you know of the complaints and suggestions of community service and we have not come to a conclusion yet obviously and people will not agree with each other until of course something is settled and taken care of. Me and a group of students have ourselves come to a conclusion that we would give you the advice to help settle this problem.

The Job of community service can be tiring but a man like you knows that putting hard work into something is a good thing. We have all had something we didn't want to but as we all it is either good for yourself or your community in the end. It can be like a homework assignment in many ways because you may not want to do it but it is for your own good and the improvement of your class grade.

I think that if we put in some effort into this than we can all do a good job and get this over with together. Not only will you just clean but you will also do something good for the general public but you will also feel good about yourself in many ways. You will notice yourself doing something good and have good pride in yourself. I myself and others are willing to help alone or together to help the public and encourage good in all of the city.

Lets think of the future and making this society a place we ant to be in and eventually we will want to help the good of people all the time until it is something we urge to do. That is how little Adults are so lets mature right now to prove the good services we can have happen.

Sincerely, The 8th grade class
