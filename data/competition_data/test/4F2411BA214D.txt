I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it helps us to define how exactly you are feeling. According to the passage it says "In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Liza. The software can identify mixed emotions". This technology was made by Prof. Thomas Huang, "an expert at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate" as said in the passage.

In my opinion i think Prof. Thomas Huang did a great job on making this project for humans and computers to communicate. Lets say if your happy, you smile to the computer this ad will pop-up and they will add another one to keep you smiling and if the next ad frowns you they will do their best to keep you smiling. The project is called Facial Action Coding System, which can detected your expression Human vs technology.

The computer detected

The Mona Liza expression, she intended to bring a smile to your face.

In conclusion these are my reasons why i think the use of this technology (FACS) to read the emotional expression of students in classroom is valuable.
