Well I think it can be a good idea to attend classes from home. if the school offer a distance learning as an option or for example some student can't not concentrate in their classes when students are araund them like friends they are playing around the class that happens a lot on my school thats why une of my friend is taking online classes too because his parent finds out. that he is nat doing good in class.

and i have a other example of my friend that he work during the day and he dosen't have time to go to the school so he is taking online classes during the night from 6:30pm to 9:00pm. and that is une of the benefits to take classes online and now is doing good at work and his classes.

one of the reasons if i had to take classes online is that i van sleep more and i can have more time to do my work because i am one of those people who like to do the work by themself thats why i will feel much better and i don't know how the video conferencing work but its sounds good i think is like you and your teacher are in a video call and he is teaching you thats great becase the student is gonna be paying atention to what the teacher is saying.

and is no ganna be distracting .

thats is my opinion to take classes online it will help a lot of people who has problem in the school or working .
