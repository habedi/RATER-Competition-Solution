Attending classes from home would benefit everyone since they are in a more comfortable and relaxed enivornment,they get to learn information at their own pace and the fear of being made fun when getting a question wrong is gone. This way of learning would make everyone view it more positively and more likely to do the work. Also less chance of distraction because friends are not around anymore to talk to.

Kids will always do best when they are in a positive and caring environment,therefore attending classes at home would for sure give them that feeling. Learning from how would get rid of all the negative distraction going on in a classroom making them lose focus on lessons. That means all around performance of the student can increase in the class. Also if students are struggling they would feel more comfortable asking a parent at home for extra help than a teacher they really just met. Whenever I can't attend school for sickness I go to Google classroom my schools virtual classroom and go over that days materials at my house which is way less chaotic and I can really just focus on what I'm doing.

Some kids don't learn as fast as others or some teachers cover material faster than students can learn. With classes at home students needn't worry about being left behind they have all the time they need to finish learning material. Also students can go through topics that interest them in more depth making their knowledge on subjects better. The students will also get the option of taking brain breaks on their own time not having to ask for permission which would make work done better with a more energized brain. Personally whenever I miss school the work I miss is always a large amount and with classes at home I have more time to catch back up,this helps me because I get sick a lot.

If students are at home taking classes they'll be more engaged because they won't be afraid of getting the question wrong in front of their peers. This is very embarrassing,I've personally have had entire classes point at me and call me names which put me down and made me not wanna say a answer I thought was correct again. With being at home there are no students to for you to embarrass yourself or get made fun of for just trying your best and giving a answer. Also kids are scared of teachers randomly calling on them which makes the classroom a scary place and give students struggling with the material feel down or like they aren't intelligent.

You might say that the students might not to the work but they do the work in school when teachers assign it what would be the difference by just doing the work at home. Some students don't even do the work while their in school. There parents will be there to monitor and make sure all the work is getting done. Also giving them the classes at home will give them more time to learn material which'll increase test scores in classes.

With students students being more relaxed and feeling comfortable difficult kids will be more coroporative,kids learning at their own pace will have more knowledge and kids not afraid to get the question wrong will learn the most helping kids in the classroom be more productive and educated human beings.
