Dear, principal

Is it good to make kids get a B rather than a C to play sports.

It is a good idea but everybody has one or more sports to do.

I don't think it is a good idea to make the kids at any school should go though that.

Sports are fun but it is already a hassle that we have to go to one or more practice already then do homework at 9:00 o'clock. Even if you have to go to practice and the go home at nine or ten and study then wake up and be tired the whole day. Sports are already hard because you have to do allot of activities.

The coaches are all hard on you even your teachers in school.

Parent want the kids to have a B but they don't want their kids working to hard in school activities and other school requirements. All of the parents in the at home are of coarse worried about their children grades. But if u don't have a C in u classes you cant play sports. Even if u don't play sports if u get a C the colleges will look at your records of the parents will have argument about it too.
