Grades are the most important thing to a student, whether they know it or not. The future of a student strongly depends on their ambition and effort in school. Without these traits they will perform poorly throughout the school year. Towards the end of the year, many students are eager to get into their swimsuits and relax under the heat of the sun, causing them to slack off in school. Some schools now require students to complete a summer project to assure that they continue to learn during their summer break. Even though this idea may fix their students lack of education over the summer, this still brings upon an argument. These schools are now debating on making these summer projects teacher-designed or student-designed. Schools should only allow summer projects to be teacher-designed, reminding society that teachers know best when it comes to their students' education.

Teachers know how to help their students understand the curriculum the most. These teachers have gone to college to learn how to teach their students. They know how to challenge their students and give them the best education. A student's education is very important when it comes to getting into college and finding the job that they want. Without the help of a well-educated teacher, the student will not be able to learn and have a well-rounded education.

Teachers are role models to their students. A student needs a role model or someone to look up to when growing up. This helps them know what they should strive to be. Teachers can be a good role model because they have traits that will help you outside of school. A few of those include being responsible, able to work with new people, and understanding to those around them. All of these will help you in later in life, which is why when the student sees their teacher as a role model their work ethic will improve. This work ethic will cause students not to slack off on the summer project.

Some people might say that summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects were student-designed, students could make the project too easy. This means that the students won't learn anything and they will forget what they learned before. On the other hand, the teacher will make the project challenging, but not too difficult, in order for the student to learn the topic. When the student is questioned on these projects it will be easier to keep what they learned in their head, instead of them not learning anything because the project is too easy.

When the student is able to understand a topic, not just memorize it and forget it later, they will have better grades. Grades will heavily impact their future due to a probable need for a college education. Meaning that, whatever the student may want to do outside of high school, it most likely needs a higher education than high school. In the mean time, students can rely on their teachers to help them become what they want to be. Which is why when schools choose teacher-designed summer projects, society will understand that the teacher can have a positive impact on their students outside of school and inside of school by helping them get the most out of their education.
