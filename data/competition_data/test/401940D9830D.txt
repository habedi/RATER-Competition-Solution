Imagine walking into a new school year, having already learned some of the topics your teachers will teach this year and still memorize some of the stuff from last year. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure students continue to learn over their summer break. Should students be able to design what they want their projects to be or should the teachers design it? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will pick educated projects for their students, it will be harder for the teachers to answer questions and grade individual projects that the students came up with their self, they will know for sure the projects taught students things for their upcoming year. Here is all the reasons why the teachers should design the summer break projects.

First, students might pick uneducated projects to do. Teachers will pick projects that help relate to what they learned in the class room. For example, students might pick what they are interest in, instead of picking what they need to learn to better their learning experience over the summer. Teachers are more likely educated than students about what the students will learn in there next grade level. So for instances, they will give them projects based off what students will need to know next year, to further their education for the next grade there are entering in. For these reasons teachers should be the one's to choose the projects for summer.

Second, it will be easier for the teachers to answer question and grade the projects. If a student gets stuck and need help from a teacher, they can email the teacher an ask for help. If it was student-designed each student might have an individual project. It will be harder for the teacher to answer all of the questions, because he or she did not pick the project for the student. If the teachers come together they can figure out the right projects that can benefit the students education. This is another example for why the teachers should design the students projects.

Lastly, some students might say that, by letting them design their own projects. It will not be boring and it will increase the rates of students actually doing the different projects over the summer. It will also make students put more effort into their individual projects. However, if they let the students decide then how will they know if their learning anything from there projects. It will be way easier if the teacher choose it because then they will know for sure they will learn something educational while doing the projects.

In conclusion, they should make the projects over the break teacher-designed, because teachers can give out educational projects, the students can ask questions about the projects the teachers have choosing and it is more easier for the teachers to grade, and they know that the teachers will choose what is best for the students to help them get through the year. To make it easier for the teachers they can all agree on what educational fun projects they want the students to do over the summer.
