Venus is worth studying even though it has various dangers. There are many things that can be learned from visiting Venus. For example Venus is Earth's twin. It is the closest planet to Earth. Astronomers believe that it was once covered with oceans and could have supported life forms.

There are plenty of dangerous things that could happen if someone was to visit the Evening Star.

For example in the article it stated that there is "almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. There are challenging clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The temperature on the planet's surface of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what it is on Earth." Humans cannot endure these type of conditions.

There are more interesting things that can happen if someone was to visit Venus. They believe that this planet is the nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea that involes a "blimp-like" vehicle that is hovering over the planet, a jet airplane that is at a higher altitude to fly over storms. Another vehicle hovering over the planet that would avoid the horrible ground conditions at thirty plus miles above the surface, the temperatures would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit; however, the pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth. Overall NASA has it all figured out they just have yet to try this experiment.

In conclusion there are many benefits to going to Venus like human curiosity will finally be answered. Another benefit is that the scientists and astronomers get to verify if it is really like Earth and maybe get the things they need to be able to visit the planet. However, there are a lot of cons with visiting Venus. It is very dangerous and can harm many people if they are not careful.
