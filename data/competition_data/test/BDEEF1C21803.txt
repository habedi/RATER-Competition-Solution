Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I'm against the possible policy change because most students have a grade average of a c. I'm against this because most student learn different ways so for some students its easy and for others its hard. This happens because everybody mind frames are not the same as others some are more advanced than others are and some are much more slower than the others. With this being said most of the people on a sports team average a b or c because its hard to maintain a grade with all of that on your hands.

If this new policy is made this might bring down most of the athlete's of our school because their average is right at a c or a little higher. This will stress the children out because they will be worrying about their grades and performance as a player. This may stop children from joining a sports team because they know they can't manage their grades and a sport so they just don't try at all because they are discourage by their bad grades. Sport teams will become smaller and smaller because of this policy about the grades because some people can't take trying to handle two things at one time our even the basic work. This may cause for schools to cancel sports all together.

The reason why im against this is because this isn't fair towards the students because everyone isn't made to be smart or dumb but they are here for a reason and the reason mite be for sports. That would be unfair for only smart people to play sports just because you can't make the grade doesn't mean you can't participate in the sports of your school. If this policy is made that would be so unfair to the students.
