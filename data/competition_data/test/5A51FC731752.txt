In the text it is stated that due to the over useage of automobiles our ecosystem is slowing down as it subtly falls apart. some of the people of the suburbs have tried to shrink down on the size to make them more, "compact and accessible", but also at the same time making efficiency easier to get by because of all the giddy inventors and people who would love to just pay good money for a different kind of car that is clean energy and runs well. Many of the people in this passage talked a lot about making some of the cities more dense so more people could and would walk to any place they needed to go with out spending a fortune on the way to where it is they need to go. near the bottom of the main passage the writer talks about the "Enviromental Protection Agency" discussing this topic as said,"Many experts expect publc transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill" it is quite obvious that the people spending so many efforts trying to pass this rule really care about the enviroment and all the beings in it.

Not only have local people in the US have been interested in taking care of the enviroment by keeping cars alienated from the situation. The second passage talks about Paris banning cars from being driven and ho wharmful it was like, "After days of near-record pollution, Pars enforced a partial driving bannto clear the air of the global city". Though a smart idea, it was quite hard to enforce due to the large amount of fines written which were about "4,000" who didn't see very fond of the idea of not driving to where they need to go. Though over time this problem did slightly and temporarily solved it's self, another counrty has gained the title of, "one of the most polluted cities in the world".

Beijing China has just been placed in the worst type of economy and climate, because of the, "cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions". The writer claimed it was the high usage of deisel fuel probably because of the large amount of automobiles with a deisel engine which the writer has accumulated a percent of 67 which is actually pretty high. These high deisel emissions was due to commercialized revanue and mass shippments of various products sold everyday nonstop. this also includes overseas and aircraft shipping which actually does make a difference not only just polluting the air and land but also the water.

Some of the places spoken of use a special event to introduce and promote the idea of not being able to use your automobile for a certain time, but in a few Columbian cities they practically have a festival about it, and some of the people even push the idea and construct walk lanes, smooth sidewalks, restaurants, and shopping districts. Even our own New York City has a "bike-sharing program" which helps the enviroment, the city, and maybe even the person, but some of the people who keep their licenses still give off more than we could get in. something that definitly boosts the car emissions is all the new technology that more and more car-makers are coming out with these days. I just beleive it is important that people learn how valuble the Earth is and how little today we respect it as our own home, so my message to all the readers is to mind how often you use your car for little things that can be resolved another sort of way.
