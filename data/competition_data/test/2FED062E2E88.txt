Dear Principle,

I think that taking away someone's ability to compete in school wide or county wide activities such as sports is unconstitutional and violating our personal rights as Americans. We should not have to have a b average to compete in sports because in the 1st amendment we have the right to freedom of speech and gather in a group to express our selves and sports can express how you feel. If you have anger you can express that in hockey by going after people.

I also think you shouldn't is because some kids don't have the brain to work but could make a living out of a sport and if you don't let them then your squandering their talents.

Another thing is, is it really your choice weather to stop a child, not even related to you, from doing something they love? I don't think so.

Mostly kids have a grade c average so is there are at a c so what they pass and because of the no child left behind law we will pass eventually and so what's the point if we play a sport. Parents are always telling us that we need to make new friends but how can we if we are secluded from the world. Even America wouldn't be here if it weren't for friends in many cases such as the revolutionary war we became friends with France and without them would not be here today.

If you take away our other activities then we wouldn't be able to do anything. And if America's future were to be raised in a do nothing world then what would our future have to hold? Nothing is that .If we don't have the physical endurance our mind has then how will we ever fight a war or even get out of bed? We wouldn't and couldn't so think hard about what was said here today and relies that all activities should be aloud and if not then i shall go on strike and run this school into the ground with boycotts and destruction of school properties. so think well and think hard and make the right decision and don't change the policy. Thank you for your time.
