I think that using a computer do detect when a student is confused or bored would help make the assignment either more challenging if the student is bored, or easier to understand when the student is confused.

In the story it states that the computer can detect when someone is happy, sad, angry, or disgusted. So why not try to make it to where the computer can also detect if the assignment the teacher gives is too hard or too easy. For some student if it is too hard they won't do it because they dont understand it. If the assignment is too easy then the student won't be challenged to use their brains. The computer should be able to detect the emotions of bordom or lack of interest and rearange the assignment to make it more interesting while still teaching what the teacher assigned.

In conclusion I would agree that the use of technology that can detect emotions would be valuable, because it would benifit both the student and the teacher. It would help the teacher know what the students understand and what they need help with. It would also help the students understand what they are leaning better.
