Do you really believe that all kids should do an extracurricular activity after school? Well, I do and so does the principal at my school. Also, an extracurricular activity dosen't always have to be a sport. It can be working on the yearbook, joining different clubs, or it could be a sport. I agree with this decision because it gets children more active, helps them communicate with other students, and just to do something instead of being at home.

Firstly, the decision makes children more active by doing things to keep them moving. There are different activities in the sports catergory to keep children moving and active. The activites consist of cheer,soccer, baseball, softball. tennis, etc. There are also inside activites such as volleyball, swim team, and basketball. Those were some examples of activites you could do to get kids active.

Furthermore, this decision helps children communiate with other students. Normally, children are shy when they meet other kids, but joining different activites throughout the years wouldnt be so hard to talk to other students. Kids often don't talk when joining new activites beacuse of the lack of communication or the lack of knowing the other students. I know this from experience. Joining extracurricular activites will help with communication around the school.

Lastly, students should just want to do something instead of being at home. I wouldn't like to be at home all day knowing I could be at home all day knowing I could be doing something fun at school. Most kids like to stay home and be bored, but little do they know, they could be in different types of activites after school. I also do activites after school, because i don't wan't to be at home doing nothing. Students doesn't like to stay at home anyway.

The decision of making all kids do activites is agreeable. They should be more active, communicate with more students, and should want to do something instead of being home. I believe that if all students at my school do extracurricular activites that the school would be a little but more fun. The students at the school would be more into ging to school.
