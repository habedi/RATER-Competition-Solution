Driving while using your cell phone has become a very controversial issue currently. Millions of drivers have had mixed feelings and opinions on this subject. In result, people have taken opposing sides. Some believe driving with using your phone isn't such a dangerous task, while others strongly believe it is an action that should never be done by drivers. They argue that this is very unsafe and can distract the driver from paying attention to the road. I agree. I believe that drivers should not use their cellphones while driving.

To begin, driving while using your phone is a very unsafe action. This is because this dangerous action diverts the driver's attention. Drivers are more prone to look at the phone to text or call someone.

When this occurs, drivers are less likely to pay attention to the road, the drivers around them, and their surroundings. Consequently, car accidents are more likely to happen.

On the other hand, some believe driving while using your cellphone isn't a distraction. However, this opinion is false. According to edgarsnyder. com, a credible personal injury law firm, it stated, "Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving." This statistic shows the absolute dangers driving while texting can cause. All in all, driving and using your phone is very dangerous and unsafe to the driver, passengers, and all people on the road.

In conclusion, driving while using or operating your cellphone is a dangerous act. Drivers should be paying attention to the road, not their phones. Cellphones offer huge distractions due to the easy accessibility to text messaging, video messaging, and all social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat, YouTube, and Facebook. It is a huge distraction and severe consequences will almost always occur.
