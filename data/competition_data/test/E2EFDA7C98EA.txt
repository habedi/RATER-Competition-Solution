Driverless cars are useful but in a way can be very dangerous. Those type of cars are like robots and have sensors. Driverless cars may seem helpful at first but what if they malfunction? They can forget to do what they were built to do. Like warn you when you are about to bump into something or if your driving to fast. It's better to use your own brain and control your own car, intstead of letting smart cars control themselves. Crashes can happen if your not paying attention, and you loose attntion on the road because you think your driverless car is helping you.

Driverless cars may seem helpful and cool but they can also put you in great harm if you don't have control of the steering wheel. Like the article said the driverless cars have a antilock brake, what if the brakes jam or stop working? Those cars also have sensors. What if the sensors stop working and if it's a driverless car, why would you want to drive a car that can drive on its own? You would get tired of letting the car drive on its own. It's much safer to drive your own car instead of letting a robot like car to drive for you.
