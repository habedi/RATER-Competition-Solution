Is this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom valuable. This is a smart idea but im not sure if it is valuable or not because in pictures or paintings you can normally tell if they are angry,happy,sad, disusted, and fearful. Why do students need technology like this to tell the emotion of a painting? I think its a good idea but at the same time not because these students can use the techniology and try to photoshop a picture with this new technology or they can try to make they painting look alot differnet then what it needs to look like... I would know im a kid myself kids do these things all the time and get away with it, But at the same time thiss could get outta hand what if you cant tell the emotions of the picture or painitns then what? How would this new technology be used at school or at another area where they get trained on how to use FACS( Facial Action Coding System). Would parnets have to help apy for there students to use this new technology, would they have to raise money to get this in this in their schools?

All in all i think its a good idea for peolpe to get the feel of useing this technology like in the art class and and photo classes this would be a nice thing to have and use at schools and other places.
