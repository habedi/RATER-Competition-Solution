Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you should change the grade average to B. It would be good for the students at SCHOOL_NAME.

It would encourage them to pull their grades up and try harder in school. It would also help them with getting scholarships and other important opportunities. Let me put it this way; if you make the grade average a B, students will try harder in school, so they can play sports and participate in other after school activities. Then if they get their grades up they'll be like "hhmmmm" maybe getting good grades isn't so bad after all.

I mean think about it good grades + sports or other after school activities= success. Students will be more likely to succeed in life. They'll also be proud of themselves for setting and achieving a goal. It'll also look good on their college applications. I mean either way, whether students have to have a B or C average it'll look good, but a B average and sports will look great. Not only for the student, but for the school to for encouraging students to strive harder for better grades and to support their fellow flucos.

All in all I think that you should change the grade average, but its your decision not mine. It will help students succeed more if you do and look good on their applications to college. More colleges might check out SCHOOL_NAME students because of their grades and how well they play in sports. I think all around it would be good for everybody not just the students.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
