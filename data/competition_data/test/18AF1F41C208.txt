Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In consideration of the school grades policy, I believe we students should have at least a C average to be able to participate in school activities.

Most students who have C' s have them because they are trying hard to get to B' s and A' s, but are not quite there yet.

Taking away promotional activities such as Basketball or Soccer would be unfair, considering how hard they work for they're grades to elevate to the C level.

Sure, some students may stop trying if a C grade is acceptable. However most do keep trying at raising grades for other reasons, one could be the approval of parents or other situated guardians. My firm belief is that we should grant C students; the rights to Sports and other fun extra circulator events, to award for at least a good trying effort at getting bad grades higher.

your friendly student, STUDENT_NAME.
