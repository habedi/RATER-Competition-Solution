My opinion on driverless cars is that they should not be legalized. My reasoning behind that is i dont want something else taking over my car when i dont know that its one hundred percent safe. You can be severley hurt if one thing goes bad with the operation because its such a major invention.

In paragraph nine it talks about how in some states its illegal like California,Nevada,Florida, and the District of Columbia. It aslo talks about the technology failing it says "if technology fails and someone is injuried, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? One other detail would be that in paragraph eight they say that "why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver"? and it says next that "wouldnt drivers get bored waiting on their turn to drive. In paragraph seven one more conflict is that the human driver has to always be on point because certain problems can occur with the creation and thats not good at all. All in all its simply not a safe thing to create or already have because its not completely safe. In paragraph three it says the one thing that makes alot of since they talk about cost they say that "the smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, somethat was just too expensive. If you come to a roadwork situation or driveways or compicated traffic issues you have to immediately take over or the worse will happen.

In conclusion this creation is not safe for the public there are to many problems that can occur at any time that are life threatning especially considering your on the road and your around others that can possibly be injuried along with you. If they want this project to succeded they need to fix all the bugs with this creation because i just dont agree with the situation.
