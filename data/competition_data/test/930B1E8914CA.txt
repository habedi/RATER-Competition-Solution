Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this to tell you my feelings about community service. I strongly feel that students should be required to do community service. I think that students should not have to do community service at pre scheduled times because as a teen i know that i like to hang out with my friends. Also, you never know what emergencies should come up in the future. I think that students should be able to do the community service within a time limit but at their own pace. Also, I think they should be able to pick when they want to work. I would like to see someone doing community service with the elementary school kids, like being tutors or reading to them. I would also like to work with the local recycling company, recycling paper, plastic, and glass. If community service should not be mandatory, I think that it should be extra credit for my grades if I do it. One way to get more people to do community service is to have parties for the people that participate for a certain amount of time. Last, I think there should be awards for the people that do the most community service.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
