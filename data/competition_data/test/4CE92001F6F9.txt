Dear Principal,

My generation is racing into a universe of electronic devices. At just the flick of a fingertip, the entire world presents itself right before our faces. Each year carries a new device that makes our lives a pinch more fluid and relaxing. To be ripped from our sleek, shiny phones would be like stealing our oxygen and water supply. On behalf of the entire student body, I plead for us to be allowed to use our phones during lunch and free time. Cell phones are a fun, portable way to keep us entertained, look up information, and remain in touch with our friends and families.

After we've dotted the i's and crossed the t's on our homework, we teenagers take pleasure in the interesting games our phones supply. Many tedious days have been salvaged by the latest and greatest iphone apps. Not all of the apps on our phones are pointless, however. There are applications for interesting and educational activities. Just the other day I discovered an optical illusion app that showed me all sorts of fascinating illusions. Some apps bring out our creative sides with drawing pictures with our fingertips. Sometimes there are even digital versions of board games on phones, like Scrabble, the wonderful spelling game that increases our vocabulary.

Instead of having to hunt for information in mountains of text books, students can look up info for school related projects on the internet connections given to us on our fantastic phones. Our phones let us onto search engines that give us everything from translators to news about current events. This gets our work done faster and smoother, and the quality skyrockets. Now we can get all the facts we need for that one thousand word essay on volcanoes in a jiffy!

Life would be terribly dull and lonely if we didn't have the beloved company of our friends and families. Sometimes between school and drama club and soccer practice, it becomes difficult to spend quality time with the people of our lives. However, phones can send text messages to all of our buddies and we can call up our parents just to say hello. If phones were forbidden, we wouldn't be able to do this.

Banning the usage of our mobiles would not only devastate us, but also restrict us from people, entertainment, and the helpful internet. In today's society, not having our phones can have harmful effects. Please keep the pupils of this school best interests at heart and bestow upon us the gift of technology.

Sincerely,

An Electronic Enthusiast
