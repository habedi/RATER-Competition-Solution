Dear principal,

We all should take part in community service to make this world more cleaner. I believe that our school would make a difference and help our nation have a better hope for tomorrow. It will be a good idea if all students could help to keep the environment neat. Some of the thinks i plan to do are: pick up trash, do positive things in the neighborhood's, inspire younger children to do go things, and help with education.

with picking up trash around the community, it would look more appropriate and would be great to keep Earth greener. maybe , if people see us caring about Earth, they would want to help out also. if we all make sure crime or gangs be eliminated in neighborhood's, there will be less things happening. Younger children look up to us, with that being said, if we show our love and support they will want to also,the community needs us and i'm willing to
