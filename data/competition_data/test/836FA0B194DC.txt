The emotion reading tech called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), should be in class rooms. This can help the teacher's make a bettter invirment for their student. This is because most of the time student will hide their emotins to keep people or things out. The tech can also be used to help the police intragating bad people.

The FACS should not be in any class becuase it gets to emotion that people don't want out. The FACS use "all 44 major muscles." This can help it make gussess on th "six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles." Beside you can how someone is "feeling simply by the look on her face."

If FACS were allowed to be in classes it could help the teacher's or instructors. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang Predicts. "Then it coud modify the lesson, like an effective human instructors." This will allow the teacher's to take action that can improve the student state of emotion. The FACS would be a overall benefit for both student and teachers alike.

The FACS can also help people that can't speak. Most of the time, when talking to people who are in need. We can't really tell what they are think. In this artical, the FACS can tell emotions made by people. Not only can the

FACS tell the six basic emotions, it "can even identify mixed emtions."

The FACS should be in classess. This is because it can make a better place for many people. It can help people who are in need and teacher and student too. This FACS can change the way we look at the people around us. It can also help us to understand other people better as well.
