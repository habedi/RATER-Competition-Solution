Dear TEACHER_NAME

Even though community service is good for cleaning up our environment, I still don't think that you should make us do community service. It takes students free time away and some kids probably won't have time to do it because they have a lot of other things to do like studying for tests, or doing there homework or even have time to be with their friends or family. If you make students do community service there's probably going to be a 30% percent chance that some students grades might go down. If I was you i would not make students do community service.

community service should be for people that have enough time to do it you shouldn't make all the students do it. Even though Community service makes our world healthier it doesn't mean that all kids should be force to do it because, kids are not the only people that liter or not clean up after their selves. It's everybody, and i don't think that kids should be punished for other people's mess, kids already have enough things to do like homework, grades, tests, personal life, and family problems if you make everybody do it your just going to put more wait on the children's' shoulders. I think that people who get introuble doing graffiti or get let out on probation or get introuble for drinking and driving should be forced to do a certain amount of hours. You should just let the people that like doing it do it and reward them with something like a homework pass or something that, and the kids that don't want to do it shouldn't have to be forced because they have to much stuff to do for or something to. If you do make the kids do Community service your making a big mistake, but hopefully this letter will make you agree with my opinion on this.
