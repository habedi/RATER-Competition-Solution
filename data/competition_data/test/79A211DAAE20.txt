The author of this story believes that exploring Venus is basically worth the risk. He has a great argument on why exploring it is a good idea, spite the dangers of it. One challenge on Venus is the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, also the temperature averages over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. In the third paragraph it says " These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth." That statement proves that Venus is far too dangerous for human contact.

In spite the dangers of Venus, astronomers still discussing visits to this planet because they are fasinated by it because it may once have been the most "Earth like" planet in the solar system. As of right now there are no machines that could stand a chance on Venus because it is so dense. NASA is trying to work on different approaches to study Venus, in paragraph 6 is says "peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of ligth cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of phtography and videogrphy ineffective." This statement proves that even when you are above Venus it is sill far too dangerous because of the dense atmosphere.

In paragraph 8 it states " human curiosity will likely lead us to many eually intimidating endeavors." There are equally dangerous tasks that humans do everday that have dangerous risks just like exploring Venus. Sometimes humans should throw out the dangers or doubts and look at what can positively come out of it. The author thinks that striving to meet the chalenge of Venus is toatlly worth it and he would take the chance because something great could come out of it, spite the risks.
