Dear Principal,

I have heard about the new cell phone policies that you have been thinking of.

I feel that policy number 2 is the better one of the 2 choices.

hear are a couple of the reasons why I personally think this.

Students enjoy using their phone every day.

I feel that sometimes the can use it a little to much during school.

I think that letting students use their phones during lunch and free time is an excellent idea.

Also students wouldn't be interrupting class every day with their cell phones.

This would be a lot better than just getting rid of cell phones completely.

As principal you might want to consider possibly figuring out a schedule were students have free time during a couple of their classes.

Doing this would not only help the new policy, but keep it going throughout the school year.

students would appreciate it if during a boring class they got a 5-15 minute break to relax and use their phones.

But, there would be some rules behind the free time.

You would have to think of them so that students wouldn't be doing stuff that is against school rules.

So principal please consider the second policy for cell phones at our school.

students do want to use their cell phones and not keep them at home.

I hope you liked the reasons why please se
