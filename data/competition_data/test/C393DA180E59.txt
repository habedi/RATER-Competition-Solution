Distracted Dangerous Driver

American teens shouldn't have the privilege of using their phone while driving. The most leading cause of death for American teens is texting and driving crashes. 21% of teens were killed in car accidents because they were distracted by their cell phone. Americans are beginning to believe the fatalities are from distractions from digital devices and undeveloped brains in their teen state.

For instance, the average student checks their phone every 8.6 minutes. This is especially dangerous because when they're leaving school, their instinct is to scrutinize their messages as they're driving.

There are already people on the road who can't drive well, so by decreasing phone access to all, not just teen, we can minimize car accidents. Because of teens undeveloped brains, they are not likely to think of the dangers around them.

Therefore, "research evidence reveals for example that a sixteen-year-old brain is not completely developed it fully developed at the age of 25." The evidence from the passage shows how early we are able to drive at such an immature state of mine. The passage also states, "When teens are speeding, brain researchers maintain, their brains thrill center is working perfectly but the part of your brain that weighs risk is not yet fully developed."

This evidence shows, teenagers at the age of 16 are being very careless on the road then being careful. Teenagers being careless on the road causes many fatalities of teens, which flows right into the next topic.

In Conclusion, proceeding more precautions can also decrease teen deaths. In this topic it really all comes down to how the lawmakers want to pursue this problem. That being said the USA must figure out a way to fix this major problem with teens being addicted to their phones.
