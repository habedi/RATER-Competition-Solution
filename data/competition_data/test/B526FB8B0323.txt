I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it helps the student get a better understanding of the lesson. For example if a student is confused about what to do the computer will detect this and modify the lesson so that the student would be more successful. In my opinion i think this would help out alot in the classroom because many students get confused or bored while doing work and most of the time its because they do not understand. with the new technology this would limit confused students and may save the teacher the time of having to explained the instructions again. it may also prevent the student from giving up or recieving a bad grade on the assignment due to preforming poorly. Although we can determine another human's emotions sometimes it is difficult because a person might smile at you but may be hurt inside so you may take this as if the person is ok. the person may also have mixed emotions which gives a person a different emotion instead of the correct emotion or how the person is really feeling. However with the computer you'll never br mistaken and can always find out a person real expression regardless if they are forcing a smile or not. In the article it states that when a person smiles muscles called the zygomatic major will lift the corner of their mouth and when a person is forcing a smile their mouth strectch sideways instead of upward. but how would a teacher know the difference if they are not aware of this. This new technology helps out with that and makes things better not only for the student but for the teacher as well.
