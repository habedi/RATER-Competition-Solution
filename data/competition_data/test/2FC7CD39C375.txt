A nice, long, and warm summer break is what many students consider the best boon of public schools. While public schools respect the break that is given to the students, they intend to make certain that every student maintains an adequate level of mental preparedness while on their break. To achieve this goal a majority, if not the entirety, of public school teachers hand out summer projects or summer assignments. These aforementioned summer assignments and summer projects should be created and designed solely by teachers; not only to ensure quality, but to simultaneously maintain the standards of learning required by the teachers.

Teacher, and only teachers, understand how they are going to administer each individual course. Therefore teachers should be the ones who decide what each assignment should be. If that stands true for everyday assignments, what changes that for summer assignments? My current Pre-Calculus AB teacher assigned her soon-to-be students a summer assignment consisting of a majority of trigonometry problems. Most complained that, "Should not we be focusing on algebra problems". To our bewilderment Pre-Calculus AB did contain a fair bit of algebra, though my teacher exclaimed, "I'm more than aware that all of my incoming students are comfortable with algebra problems. I expect that of them. However this course requires both algebra and trigonometry which is why i make sure that all my students hone their trigonometry skills over the summer". As just demonstrated, a student is incapable of making the right judgment calls on assignment because they lack the foresight of knowing what will be taught through the entire course. Only a teacher knows what they will teach which is why they make the assignments, not the students.

However, many students contend that only a student truly knows how they themselves learns the best. This argument however fails to realize that it is a part of each county's, administrator's, and teacher's job to understand every attendee of their school and this understand is what makes counties, administrators, and teachers the best candidates to dictate what students should be working on over the summer. As the son of a high school English teacher, i sit in on many conversations and phone calls between her and another teacher that are entirely dedicated to helping a student do better in school. Those are the actions that many students never get to see their teachers take a part in. Various counties and school administrators cooperate to put computers and tablets put in every school because they understand there are a vast amount of visual learners that struggle to retain knowledge given though lectures. Counties are also tackling issues such as bright lights inhibiting academic performance and how school times affect the academic ability of their students. This helps to prove the point that students are understood at every level of authority in public schools. That very understanding ,that many students fail to witness, is what makes a teacher the prime candidate to create a summer assignment.

Lastly, an assignment of such significance needs to be carefully and meticulously crafted. Not only do students lack the knowledge of what to put on an assignment, they lack the necessary skills required to make an effective assignment. Evidenced by students lack of a degree in education. This gap in skill was shown to me when my English teacher assigned a project to make our own lesson. A lesson which was to made by groups of five and teach the rest of the class about one section of A.C.E.S., a format for writing essays. Every lesson was ill prepared, unfocused, and poorly constructed. Not for lack of effort, but because we simply did not have the proper training. No such student missing so much skill should be designated to make an assignment of so much importance, only a teacher that has the proper training and vision for the assignment being made.

A summer assignment differs from no other common assignment other than when the assignment should be completed. Like any other assignment, a summer assignment should be handled by a teacher to facilitate the assignments quality.
