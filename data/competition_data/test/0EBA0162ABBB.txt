Do you ever have things to do after school that you absolutely have to do no matter what? Well I do sometimes and I would hate it if I missed out on some of the plans I make during the week. Some of the plans are more serious than others but that really doesnt matter. I disagree with having to participate in after school activities because kids have stuff to do after school, some kids just don't want to stay at school any longer, and some parents might not like that their kid has to stay after school.

One reason is that kids have stuff to do after school. They might have sports that they need to practice for like football, basketball, and soccer. Kids have to go grocery shopping with their parents so they can get what they need at home. Parents also might have family activities planned that they really want their kid to go to. For example my family likes to take me out to eat after school sometimes.

Another reason is that a lot of kids might not want to participate. Kids like to just go home after a long day of school because they might be hungry or it might be something like a headache. Also students might not like he activities that the school makes you go to. For example, they might like helping their favorite teacher clean up or plan for their next day after school. And they might feel that instead of helping out for a year book it should extra math work, language arts work, or science work.

Parents possibly being mad at the school is another reason. Parents might want their kid home for reasons like chores, so kids can help parents, and parents just want their kid at home with them. Another big thing is that parents might not be able to give a ride if the school doesnt provide an after school bus. For example, whenever I stay after school I ride the activity bus but some days shelburne doesnt have an activity bus. Parents also might not be ok with the school making kids stay after and they might complain a lot to the principal.

In conclusion students should not have to participate in extra curricular activities because kids want to go home, they have other things to do at home, and parents might not be happy with their kid having to stay after school without a choice. Kids do a lot of things after school and having to stay after school would ruin some of the things they do. For example, kids like me like to go home and play video games and I really would not like it if we had to stay after school. And my parents would also be mad because they want me to come home instead of staying after school so I can help them with things they need.
