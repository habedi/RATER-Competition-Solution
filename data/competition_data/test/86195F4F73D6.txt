Technology that can read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is very valuable because if we use this type of technology in classrooms now a days, we can see how students are feeling and see their emotions like happiness, surpised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. I think yes, this can help us in many different ways.

One of the reasons why we should have this type of technology in classrooms is to read every students expressions to see how their feeling today at school. If the student is feeling sad or depressed and the technoogy picks that up, teachers can do something about it to maybe help the student in someway. This peice of new technology can help prevent conflicts or in some bad situations where a student is feeling anger or distress. In paragraph 6, it states that " a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". This can help teacher teach better in class and help the student understand better if they feel them type of emotions.

The Facial Action Systems technology can be studied by students in the claasrooms, they can study on themselfs to see how there feeling today. They can see if their friends are happy or sad, that can just improve our social skills by trying to figure out why their friends or classmates are feeling these types of emotions. This can make us better people by comunication with one another. This software should be used in classrooms, it will make our teachers teach better in their lessons, its will make students better in the classrooms because the teacher will know what is wrong weather your confused on the lesson the teachers will know and they will help the students become better each day with this technology.

I think it will be a good idea to have this software in the classroom because not only will the students, teachers, and other members in the school will know what your feeling, your own family members can see also how you are feeling today in the classroom as well. This can help improve the comunication with their loved ones at home too. They can seek help if they really need it if parents see what the problem is weather if your child is feeling sad or just confussed, teachers can make sure parents will be notifed to see what is the problem in their child. Thanks to this technology, it will make better students.

The facial Acton Coding System is just would be a great thing to use in a classroom, it will make students better students by just reading their facial expression every day when their at school. It will improve schools just by many different ways with this facial technology. Students and teachers will learn alot from this and finding out that by just making faces could reval so much about the science of emotions behind this fine technology software.
