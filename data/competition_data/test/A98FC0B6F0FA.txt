Dear Principal,

I agree with the policy you have suggested.

The reason is because some students are lazy to do their work.

Then, they wouldn't want to do the work and get distracted by other things.

For example, they might start daydreaming about sports or the mall, or look out the window.

Students have to earn the fun they have.

If a student isn't doing their work in school, why are they allowed to have fun with school activities?

Students with at least a B average work hard to do their work to the best of their ability.

For the work they have done, they deserve a break from work, which are the school sports and activities.

Students that have a C average are most likely sluggish and don't want to their work for basically no reason at all.

If they goof around and such, why should they be allowed to participate in sports and activities?

They shouldn't be allowed to.

It's a student's own fault to be goofing around.

For instance, if a grade C average cuts school and hangs out at a restaurant, they wouldn't learn the principles of the subjects the other students in their school are learning.

Then, they might come back for sports at physical education and have even more fun.

Your point of view is logical because their not having their education properly.

I agree with you and say they shouldn't have access to sports and activities.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
