The Facial Action Coding System is a great idea for students to use. With technology advancing so much it is essential for the school assignments to advance along with it. This technology is the next step for students and teachers alike. The FACS should read the facial expressions of students because it could keep students engaged, and addresses whether or not they understand the subject.

The FACS is able to keep the student from getting bored. While working on the computer for so long a student can easily get bored and tune out the lesson. The FACS though, can use its technology to make the content more engaging; like making "computer animated faces more expressive" (D'Alto). By making faces and other aspects of the lesson more interesting students have a higher chance of keeping their interest in the lesson. This is just one example of how useful the Facial Action Coding System could be for the students outside of class.

The FACS also would tell when the student is struggling or is confused with the material. Normally in a class setting a student can ask a teacher for help, but it is not that simple on the computer. Instead of the student continuing to not understand the work the system "could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" (D'Alto). This way the student can be sure to get the correct information and not miss out on anything from lack of understanding. This is another reason as to why the FACS would be a great tool for the learners.

To close, the FACS is the right step for helping students. Not only does it keep them interested in the lesson, but also helps when the student is confused. This technology can be beneficial to students and teachers because of all of the usefull features that it offers. Since "most human communication is nonverbal, including emotiuonal communication...computers need to understand that too" to fully utilize the technology that is available to help the children learn.
