New technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows the computer to identify humans emotions. They say the process starts with a 3D

computer model of the face that has all 44 major muscles that they believe will move like human muscles. While Including the six basic emotions happiness, surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness to then try and associate each of these characteristic movements of facial muscles to help read a human emotions. This technology has no true value there is many reasons i say this because how can computer truly read humans emotions or mix emotions with knowing its actually how they feel is real or right? Humans emotions can be made to seem one way but not be right at all just because a person is smiling doesn't make them happy or mean they are they could deep down be mad. Trying say this technology is able to read human emotions Can not be true one the tested subjects was a painting project that's not alive. How can we believe this techonogly truly works when there is no live test subject of a random person. Basic facial expressions can not truly tell you if someone is happy, or sad, computer technology can not understand persons emotions we are living beings not picture human being made by artist. Just because the way are face or mouth muscles move does not say anything about humans emotions in that moment. Conclusion the Facial Action Coding System technology has no it dose not have the able to read humans emotion facial expressions can be different from ones emotions , and how they feel. How can computer understand us better we humans know ourselfs it's not possible the human facial expressions can not define are mindset ,and the way a person actually feels human emotions are a unqiue thing. Every human is different the way

I smile vs another person can mean two emotions or mix emotions behind my smile and the person who is smiling opposite of me. Basically if there is research in the world saying that every human that smiles really means their happy without any mix emotion ,and can show proof that makes you feel happy. Then i would feel this technology maybe had chance of actually being real deal in terms of reading a humans emotions but we as humans continue to develope ,and are getting smarter by the the generation there is multiple ways to try determining how human feels. Facial expressions and eyebrows moving is just one of many. We humans also have ability to decieve anything especially technology we ourselves created we know hte flaws in our own inventions.
