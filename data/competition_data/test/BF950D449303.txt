Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.

Having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.

For example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.

Forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.

Forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.
