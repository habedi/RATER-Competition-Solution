The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that's used for detecting emotions on your face, I'm in between both agajinst and for the use of this on students in classrooms. Being able to detect emotions by scanning someones face isn't wrong because it's not hurting anyone, I just personally think we could be useing the money that would get used to make this for other, more important things than this. This FACS could be used for things outside of students it would be more vaulable, for example, this got used for the Mona Lisa painting to know how she was really feeling, this could be used for so many other things like therapy offices or research in phycology. I also support that if you are sitting in class and the teacher can see how you're feeling, like if you're board, or you don't understand what they are teaching but you don't want to say anything about it so they will be able to improve the lession to make it more fun or help you if you're struggling. I just don't think we should invest all into (if that's what the question is asking) putting these into schools, it does have value just not that much. It has value enough to help depressed people or anyone who needs it. What it comes down to is if we can already detect someones emotion in some type of way then why would we need these in schools?
