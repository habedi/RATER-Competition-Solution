Students would not benefit from being able to attend class from home because, students would not receive the same amount of help from the teacher as a student in class would, some students would not focus because there could be multiple distractions , and they would not finish their work on time, and students would not be able to work in group assignments, and not elaborate as well in group discussions.

When a student is attending a class from home, they may not receive the same amount of help because of how many students there are, it would take a while for each one to receive help. If a student attends a class online, it may take a long time for the teacher to respond to emails, discussion boards and get questions answered. A student who is in class can easily ask the teacher directly, and face to face if they have a question on a worksheet, an assignment, or on the lesson. The student attending the class online would have to wait to have their question answered and by the time the student has moved on, the teacher's response would not help the student and they would not benefit from it. When a student has a question on the lesson, the teacher may not understand the question fully in detail and answer it in a different way. This would not benefit the student because they may need to go out of their way to learn from another source and then be behind on their work.

Students that attend a class online would take it at home, when they are at home then there could be many distractions, and the student could procrastinate. If the student has more distractions in their learning environment then it can lead to the student not being able to learn and understand the topics the class is covering. This would not be beneficial for the student because if attended in class, the teacher could control the environment of the students and it the student could be more productive. Attending the class online could mean that the student is procrastinating the assignments, and turning them in late. If the work is turned in late, or they are not doing the work, all the work could pile up and become an issue for the student because they have the responsibility to complete them in a certain amount of time, and end up with a bad grade.

Classes in school have many assignments that involve group work and group discussions. When a student attends the class at home they have to do online discussions, but most of the time it is harder to elaborate in discussions online then it is in person. The student can lose communication skills and makes it harder to do group work online. If there is an assignment that has to be completed by a group, it would make it hard for the student who is not there to be part of a group and can affect their grade and really not be beneficial to the assignment. It is easier for the student to be there in person to help out as much as they can, when students do group work it is usually to expand their thinking and give each other ideas to use for the assignment. It is harder to give off ideas or receive ideas through an online class, it would benefit the student more if they are able to directly tell and help the other students face to face. It would benefit the student more to be in class at school to expand social, and communicating skills.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend class from home because, students would not receive the same amount of help from the teacher as a student in class would, some students would not focus because there could be multiple distractions at home, and procrastinate their work, and students would not be able to work in group assignments, and not elaborate as well in group discussions.
