Phones and Driving

So everybody knows the question should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving? Now depending on who you are this answer might be different. However, for me it's a no. Drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving because the use of cell phone is distracting.

Driving is a privilege and can be taking away so it's best to just put away distractions.

Now you and I both know cellphones are distracting as I mentions in my first paragraph, but how are they distracting? Well they are distracting by sending e-mails, texts, or pictures. Driver think that if they get a text that they can just respond really fast. However, those three seconds you take to respond can be the cause of a huge accident. Drivers just need to be aware that text can wait because you do not want to put yourself and others in harm over a text.

Finally let's get on to the facts. Statics show that about 1.6million crashes happen each year due to cellphone usage. They also show that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to car accidents and 9 of those deaths are due to distracted drivers. But car accidents can be costly in other like increased insurance and fixing cars hurt you financially or you can break a bone and be hurt physically and financially because you have to pay for medication. These can also lead to other very stressful situations.

So to conclude if you are driving do not use your cellphone. The text or e-mail can wait until you have reached your destination. If you do you can harm yourself and others. Overall using a cellphone while driving cannot only be deadly but costly.
