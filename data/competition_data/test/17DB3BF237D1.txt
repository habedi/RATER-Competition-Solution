The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program that can benefit you and others. The Seagoing Cowboys help people all over the world by taking care of the animals getting shipped over seas, to the countries that were let in ruins after World War ll. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy lets you help others, but have some fun at the same time.

In paragraph 2 of the article, it states "UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas." The Seagoing Cowboys get to help the cites in ruins by taking care of the animals being sent overseas.

In paragraph 5, Luke says that he not only gets to help people, but he gets to go sight-seeing in different countries. He go to see the Acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. He also go to tour an excavated castle in Crete and see the Panama Canal on his way to China. In paragraph 8, the article states that Luke especially enjoyed the return trips. "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy would also help you learn how to work hard. In paragraph 6, the article tells the readers that it takes two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean, and one month to get to China. In that time, you have to feed the animals and give them water two to three times a day. Hay bails and bags of oats have to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship, and stalls have to be cleaned.

In conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would benefit not only you, but others around the world. You will learn how to work hard, but have some fun. The Seagoing Cowboy program might open you to the world, like it did to Luke, and it might not. All in all, the program will teach you things you might not have known and give you the chance to help people all over the world.
