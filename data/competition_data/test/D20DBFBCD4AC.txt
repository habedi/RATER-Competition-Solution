i think policy one is the best because kids have to get home if they are sick and dontn want to go to the office and tell them. then they can go home and get better so they arnt in trouble with there parents to go to the office to get you so. you can get better and you don't miss school and get bad grades. then kids will be missing school and they will have really bad grades and get held back and they wont have to take that year over.

then people parents would be mad because you were sick and could not go to school and then people would be like where were you i have not seen you in like a month or two. then they can make it to school and wont get in trouble by there moms or dads. then people will not be able to get an education and graduate but then you could get your diploma and get a job and get people to do things for you and then you would no be able to use your phone at lunch.

then you would not be able to tell your mom where you are going after school and you would not get in trouble. then your mom would ground you and take your phone and you would never get it back then a month later you would get it back. then you can text people at lunch and then you would be able to get to work on things in school then you can get good grades and graduate to get a good job so you can be something that you like then that would be cool.

then people would be like where did your phone i want one like that and then you could go and get people to get phones so you can text them. then you can get help from teachers and then you could get people that drive to come pick you up to take you to places like friends houses. then you would be able to get other things so you can do more things like those. then you can be like what's new with you man that is sometimes fun then people text u in class and you are like wow in class and they are like what is the answerer for number three.

some times i tell them find it out i am not helping u with anything then do my work ant they probably text back. then you can get people too do your work and then they get cought for cheating and get there phone taken but they get in trouble and the office comes and takes both phone that you a texting and then people don't like that. then they come for you because they got there phone taken away and they are mad at you and want to beat you and you run like a wimp.
