Do you ever wonder how many soomething is or how much something weights? In this essay the author compares more than one thing to one another.

The author supports the idea of "The Challenging of Exploring Venus" by comparing "Earth as Venus twin and that it is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too" which means that Earth is the closet planet to Venus than any other planet in the world. Another way the author supports his text is by saying that "Earth,Venus,and Mars,our other planety neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds" what that means is that all those other planets are the ones neighboring to it and that they have many different speeds and are many different sizes throughout the whole planet while it orbits. The third way the author supports his information in the text is by how he compares all the other planets to one another not just one planet to the next. Last supporting text the author supports in this is that "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus" what the author is trying to say is that one big thickness of the atmosphere is almost basically covered 97 percent with a carbon dioxide blanket. In conclusion the author compares all these planets to one another.

In the second paragrah the author loves to use many different techniques to describe the story to people who are reading it. Another thing the author does in the story is tell how much Earth,Venus,Mars weigh throughout the whole story. Another way the author supports his evidence in the story is by telling us were they are located at.

In conclusion,the author supports his text very well by comparing the other planets to each other not just to one another. Also the author likes to use numbers to show how much of the percent got covered or how many times something happened during the times throughout the whole thing something got done in or covered.
