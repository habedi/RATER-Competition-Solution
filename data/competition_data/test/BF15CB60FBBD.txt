Dear State Senator,

We should not keep the Electoral College. Every year it is a close election due to the Electoral College. In the system of the Electoral College the voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors, whom the slate of electors then elect the president. The Electoral College is a disaster and is very unfair to all of the voters, it's outdated, and irrational. I know the Electoral College has been around awhile but it seems to make things difficult. Things should be kept simple when it comes to voting for the president. It's unfair to people because there vote could not even count, it's up to the slate of electors. The Electoral College consist of too many voters, it's not public getting to vote, it's pretty much just the slate of electors. It's almost like they are telling us that we have no choice in which kind of method people want to use. It's not fair to of how they elect the president. The method the Electoral College should not be in use anymore, it should be changed to a popular vote. The Electoral College cause the biggest election crisis in a century. It focuses on the tight races in the "

swing

" states. That is my arguement of why we the people of America should not keep the method of the Electoral College system. Abolish the Electoral College!
