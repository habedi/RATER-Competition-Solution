Is it challenging to explore new thing , or new planets? sometimes it is easy and sometimes it is challenging but it all depends on what your are going to do.

In this article I read about humans researching information about the planet venus. In venus the temperature it's really really different than our temperatures. the temperature in Venus is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than what we have experience in our planet. Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system. in paragraph 3 it says "average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also in paragraph 3 it says

"Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. This is saying that Venus is hot even though Mercury is close to the sun, Venus shoudn't be to hot. The nasa people has sent people to explore Venus. In Paragraph 5 it states " The national Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

has ... idea for sending humans to sudy Venus."

In conclusion i strongly believe that people should start to explore new things even though it might be challenging to keep exploring new thing.
