Now a days you see everyone with cars driving to places instead of walking. There are some small towns that cars are not needed because everything is so close but other cities everyone has to drive because everything is very distant from one another. Cars are needed on a daily basis to get to school, or to get to their job but walking or even biking would be a great idea because you would not be poluting the environment there would be less traffic jams and it would reduce the greenhouse gas. Limiting car usage would be a great idea and it would make peoples life a lot better and healthier because instead of driving they would walk to take a bike.

Polution is a big problem especially in big cities because everyone is driving and the smoke the cars leave makes our environment gross. Polution is not only because of the smoke the cars produce, it can also be when someone throws plastic into the oceans and poluting the waters or having trash in parks without recycling. I think we should re-enforce the recycling systems because many people dont know the benefits to that and how better our community and even world could be. When your are driving a car and especially in big cities like New York you need a car everywhere or just take the taxi. But just taking the taxi it wont reduce the probablity of polluting the air, it will still have the same effect as if you were driving your own car. If people would just walk or bike to their job or to their school poluting the air would not be a problem just like stated in source 2. In source 2 it talks about how in Paris they would fine the people up to 31 dollars.

There would also be less traffic jams due to the limiting of car usage just like stated in Source 3. In source 3 it talks about how in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that the colombians would ride their bike skate or take the bus and there would be less traffic jams. That is a very good idea because no one likes to be stuck in traffic especially if your in a hurry to get to work or even school. Traffic jams occur because of so many cars on the road. There is a thing called Rush hour and that is when everyone is leaving their work or school and they are going home and that is when everyone is on the road and thats when their is the most traffic. But it would be much easier if you would just bike or walk or take a bus and tried to avoid all of those traffic jams. The program that Bogota, Colombia has created is something that should be done nationwide because it would help so many other countries. Thanks to that programm people would go to the park and do sports and take walks.

Source A talks about the Greenhouse gas and how in Vauban,Germany soccer moms gave up their cars and how the streets were " Car Free". That led to having 70 percent of the families in Vauban to not having  cars and 57 percent of the people that moved to Vauban to sell their cars. According to this source a person said they are much happier not owning or having a car because when Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother had a car she said she was more tense. Apperently this movement was called " Smart Planning".

Limiting car usage would be a great benefit to people and a great idea to improve Earth. Pollution like mentioned before is one of the biggest problems we have and in big cities is an evern bigger problem. Traffic jams is something that will be hard to stop because everyone is using cars and will continue to use cars because it seems like thats the fastest way to get to your location but thats not accurate because if people think that way then thats the cause of traffic jams and thats the cause of the Rush hour. The movement in Vauban, Germany is something that people should do. Im not saying sell your car but to reduce the car usage is something that would be very helpful not only to you, but for the environment.
