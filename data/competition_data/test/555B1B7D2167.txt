I disagree that we must participate in a school activity that we might not even enjoy doing because we don't have to do something that we are not good at or generally, what the principal wants us to do. In every school, there are so many activity that you can do, but do you really have to do them? No, i don't believe so. Every student should decide on what they want to do. Not all students want to do activitiesÂ that others want them to do. We should be heard instead of the principal or staff making all of the decision that we may not agree on, like having to participate in school activities.

There are so many different activities that we can do. Not all needs to be decided by the principal. Students should find a hobby or a activity that they think they are good at. Things out of school. Not everyone is perfect at doing a specific type of activity or sport. Every is different, no one will ever be the same as one another. They should choose something that they want to do, not what someone else picks for them. Let them see what they are good at and decide.

Other parents may find this upsetting. Some parents want their kids to join a sport or do different activities but what if there isn't any time for them. Most of these activities are after school and not everyone has time to do them. Other students have important things to do and they just might be able to do any activity. Some parents don't want their kid stressed and if there is just many things for them to do. An after school activity or anything related to that, just might not be right for them to do. Other parents want their kids to do a sport or serve on the student council but they might not realize how it can affect their kid. The same goes for the principal too. They said that all students must participate in at least one activity but what if they can't?

The principal should listen to students' opinions and what they want to do instead of having to do these activities that they told them to do. Every student has a right to state their own opinions and the principal should listen to them. If the students don't want to do the activities that the principal told them to do, he or she should listen to them. They all have their own reasons to why they decide to either do the activities or not. Maybe the school should listen to what they have to say. If it's important to them then it matters.

I believe that we should let the students decide on what they rather feel like doing. They should talk to the principal first. They should listen to what their students have to say. If they want to do an activity then they should. But if they decide that they dont want to have to do these activities or they just can't do them, to talk to the principal. We should all do something that we would enjoy doing but if we just don't feel comfortable then we shouldn't.
