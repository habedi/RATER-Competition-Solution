Dear Principal,

I am writing to you regarding our school's cell phone policy. I think that you should not allow kids to have their cell phones at school. I think that this would be a good idea because kids would be on their phones during class if they were allowed to have them at school. Even if the cell phones were only allowed during lunch, kids would still use them during class. If a kid was bored during a class, they might take their phone out and use it because they know the teacher won't notice any way. This might cause a distraction to other kids. Or kids might be distracted using their phones that they don't do their class work and do badly on a test or in class

Anyway when kids are at school who could they be texting? If their friends are standing right next to them why do they need their phones? They don't. If the kid claims it is an emergency they can ask a teacher if they can use the classroom phone or ask to use the office phone. Anyway kids can use their cell phones after-school or before school. They already use their phones after/before school, they don't need to use their phone during school too, I don't think any kid really needs to be on a phone that long. Also if kids were allowed to use their phones during lunch or a break they might not notice what they're doing or where they're going and they could bump into someone and get hurt or hurt someone else.
