I think that driverless cars are great. you dont have to drive when you are trying to put on makeup or do other things that u dont have time to do when you are in the house. It would make it easier when you have to go somewhere and you do it feel lke driving. There will be self driven cars in the future. It is a big negative on having self driven cars to one messup in the cars system and it can take away lifes. It could be a tragic accident from jus one messup. There is many things that can go wrong but not alot of things that can go right.

Having driverless cars have its pros and its cons in all I think it would be a good thing. If something goes wrong thought the dealership could have alot of legal problems. Then te us will have to change some of the laws if they make driverless cars. I think that druverless cars could be the next big thing if it becomes a sucess. there become a great what if factor if they go through with the driverless cars. What would be the point if you still have to hold the wheel when you have the so called driverless car about bmw.

I think that driverless cars will be and great thing its will help with everyday driving. It can be just as bad as good . In the long run i think it will be and great thing and people will love it.
