Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student that actually likes to learn, but also has a social life, I am happy to know that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy, and have made up my mind about which policy I prefer, and i chose the second policy.

The second policy states that students would be allowed to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I find this idea to be very good for a few reasons, one being that both staff and students can find this appealing. Because the cell phones will be turned off during class time, the teachers will not have to worry about cutting class short because they have to confiscate a student's cell phone. Also, when cell phones are used during free time and lunch, the students will be happy to text, call, etc. parents and guardians or other friends during their six hours at school.

Because cell phones were first made really for the idea of calling during an emergency, this policy will be very good for that. Students can call a parent, or even the police during an emergency because they will have their cell phones with them, this can also be used vice-versa and parents can call or text their children and inform them of things like the un ability to have a ride home or such, so that way the child won't have to freak out about whether or not to ride home with a friend...

In all, I hope you see the point that i am trying to make, that cell phone's in school are a very good idea, and benefit the teachers and staff.
