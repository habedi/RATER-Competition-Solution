I believe the summer project should be student-designed because every student learns differently from another, it will express students creativity and originality, it will make it more enjoyable for students.

The student-designed summer projects will show how every student learns differently from another. Their are many ways to learn information. Student's can learn information through watching a video, reading, or even experiencing it in real life. After gathering their information, students can make a poster, a presentation, a news article, a website, or even write a song about it. The students will show the teacher the best way they learn through their choice in the project.

The summer project will also express students creativity and originality. Students creativity comes from their imaginations. Their imagination is filled with their interests and the things they are passionate about. For an example, I'm really passionate about dance and I want to learn more about the history of dance. I will make a project on the history of dance. I will use the information I already know about the subject and research more information. Every student 's project will be original and creative in their own way because everyone has different interest and ideas.

Summer break is a time for students and teachers to have fun with family, friends, and to go on vacation. They won't be thinking about school. The summer project is a great way for students to continue learning during the summer. It will be more enjoyable for students to pick the idea and the way they present it. I think this will have more students participate in the assignment and be eager to learn during the summer.

The teacher-designed summer project is also a good idea because it makes it easier for the teacher to grade the same project. It will also make it easier for students to know what their idea is and how they are going to present the project.

Over all, I think the student-designed summer project will be a great way for students to learn and present something they are passionate about through a creative way.
