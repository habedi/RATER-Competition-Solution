umm, maybe we can settle downoff the cars !!, i beleive that can be an good idea for citizens in the united states without cars this can be a better world for me and people in my community and my city , this can help reduce the amount of air pollution from cars and  from other automobiles ,another way  we can decrease the use of cars is by having a car-free week. these ways can make a big change in the way people use cars  in thisx culture.

the reduce in car usage can help people from getting sick from trucks and cars from polluting the air, not only can people get sick but animals such as,dogs cats and some farm animals wat humans eat. the pollution in the air can cause plants to  die what farm animals feed on,for example where i live i saw an horse suffering from  dead plants. also, car pollution  can sometimes cause crashes because of all the smoke from an bad engine or even car that fan can be over heated, for instance one time i was on my way to walmart on a very hot day , all of a  sudden smoke started coming from my mom smoke pipe under the car, the cause of this was because her fan was over heated. there can be many ways an car can cause  pollution in the air thats why we need to slow down on  the car population or usage a day.

air pollution can be a major way fror the president to pass an law about car usage. but,  another way to stop people from using there cars. are by having an week off from cars and big trucks,if we have an week off from cars  more people  would be walking more or riding bicycles. for example, according to the seattle times in the city of bogota  people had less stress from being jammed up in traffic and lower air pollution. ,moreover, this can help because it can slow down the amount of fuel people use in a day. just imagine one week without cars this people can be able to catch the bus instead of driving. without cars people could slive better.
