In the artical "making Mona Lisa Smile" the auther talks about the new technology called Facial Action Coding System. The new technology would be helpful in the classroom to identfy if students are bored or becoming bored. This passage states "A classroom computer could recongnize when a strudent is becoming confused or bored," "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" people understand human facial expression, computers need to know the same,because many hours of our lives are spent behind a computer screen.

Is facial expressions a science? Dr. Paul Eckman "has classified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness" these are all emotions we can see in person and we all respond differently when we see these emotions. In paragraph five "For instance, you can tell gow a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." This states the us as human beings notice and feel emotion linked to others in our lives."Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communcate" In the artical is states "For ecample, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad mkght follow" This shows that the computer notices the smile and links that with happness or enjoyment.

In conclusion the facial expressions read by humans everyday should be put into computers. In paragraph six it states " "Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang" This is showing that people do not always talk about their feelings. "so computers need to understand that,too" said Dr. Huang
