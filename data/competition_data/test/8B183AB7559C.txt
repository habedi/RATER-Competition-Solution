I am aginst the development of driverless cars. I am aginst driverless cars because they could be very dangerous machines, the text states "...The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." In other words the human must take action when the car doesn't know what to do and this could be very dangerous if the car doesn't stop driving or alert you soon enough to take the wheel. Another reason for being aginst the development of driverless cars is if the vehical is one hundred percent driverless then it means you are being transported by one big computer and like other computers under the wrong conditions it will crash.

If there were driverless cars not everyone would be able to afford them so the cars on the streets today would have to be extra careful when around a driverless car because they don't know if it could mess up and make them wreck. Also if there was a situation where a driver of a regular car made a mistake the driverless car wouldn't have the reaction time of a human to avoid any crashes and that would put the ones in the driverless car is a paranoid state until reaching their destination. The development of driverless cars would mean more regulations and rules on transportation which might not be a good thing. If there were more regulations and rules regarding the driverless cars there would also be more loop holes in that part of the justice system.

These visions of a future with driverless cars should be left at just visions because of the dangers and unessesary risk of getting to a destination a bit sooner. It is because of the reasons stated above that I am aginst the development of driverless cars.
