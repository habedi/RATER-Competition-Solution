The Facial Action Coding System or FACS, in my opinion could be very helpful and useful in the future. The reason I say this is because, there are many students that get very bored, very unamused, confused and irritated with school work. And if we were able to have The Facial Action Coding System, it could possibly help students get back on track very easily.

In the text I read about how The Facial Action Coding System was able to, "calculate emotions". And like I said I think this could be very beneficial to students and adults in the Educational Field and the Work Field. For example, in the text it says, "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." This shows that the FACS is following your mood, so whatever mood you have the following ad will appear. This could be the beginning of participation. In addition, they also say that a classroom computer could detect or recognize when a student is becoming bored, confused, or unamused, according to Dr. Huangs prediction. They also say, "It could be an effective human instructor.". This could be very effective on students and teachers. I say this because, if a student is bored or confused an ad that pops up could help them realize some things and help put them on track and hopefully get interested.

"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too." according to Dr. Huang. This not only is efficient for students or teachers but, it is also beneficial to Surgeons. This technology is valuable and very useful it seems. The Facial Action Coding System is, a human emotion identifier or detector and this would be very useful to a classroom of students. And others.
