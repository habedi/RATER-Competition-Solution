H: Have you ever had to balance school work, homework, a job, and multiple after school activities? If so then were you able to do it well? I think students having a mandatory extracurricular activity is a terrible idea, I think this because some students may have jobs after school, some may have to help their families, and some would have to do multiple activities.

The first reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students have a job after school. I have a friend that is trying to get a job and he would probably work everyday after school. When he gets home after school he world only have a few hours to get his homework done and get ready for work, since he would probably go straight to sleep when he got home after work and not have time to do his homework. If he also had an after school activity then he would have even less time to do his homework and get ready for his job. He would also be even more tired when he got home because he didn't have the few hours he would normally have to get some rest before he had to get ready.

The second reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students may have to help their families after school. Some students when they get home after school don't have a parent home to take care of their siblings so they would have to do it. They have to make food and make sure their siblings do what they are suppose to do be doing. If they had to have an extracurricular activity then they would get home later than their siblings. Their siblings would have time to do whatever they wanted before anyone got home. Then when they got home they would have to get their sibling back to what they are suppose to be doing. After that they would have to make food, clean up whatever their siblings were doing, do their homework, and any other work they may have to do.

The final reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some people would have to do multiple activities. If someone was already doing one activityÂ but it wasn't created as a part of the school you go to then you would probably have to start a second activity and try to balance the two activities, schoolwork, homework and anything else that they have to do after school. If they are not able to balance everything then they would have to stop doing one of the activities, and it would probably have to be the activity that is not a part of the school. Also some students may be doing a sport and sports are only for part of the year so they would have to do multiple and the start and end dated for the sports may overlap. So they would be doing two and may miss practice or a game for one of them.

In conclusion I think that schools having a mandatory after school extracurricular activity is a terrible idea because some students may have jobs after school, some may have to help their family, and some would have to multiple activities. Some students would have to balance schoolwork, homework, the two activities, a job, families, and anything else they may have to do after school. All of that may be too much for some students and they could fall behind in their classes.
