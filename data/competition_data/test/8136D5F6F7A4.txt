Dear Principal,

I would just like to say that you should let us use are phones during lunch because we are responsible enough to not use when told to do so. I think that if you let us do this then before we actually start doing it that you should try it first to make sure it will work and when does then we will start do just that. Another is that I think a phone could also help are work and are grades in school. If you don't like this idea that we use phones only at lunch I think we should do something like we get these phones that will help us with are work and grades that we will all pass are grades. It does have to exactly be like policy one, but maybe we could get some type of phone usage in the school and I think if you do this more kids would be interested and there school work because you let them have there phones out during lunch or because you let us use them for work and are grades.

Sincerely,
