Summer projects are never fun, whether they are made by students or a teacher, at the end of the day, it takes away time of a students summer. The summer is a time for students and teachers to relax, but students often forget most of the information they learned during that past school year.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students may make the assignments too easy and put in no effort, teachers can give the assignment based on what they learned and what they need to know for the following year and, the teachers will be able to grade it faster and will help get a better understanding about which students are struggling in what areas of the subject.

When making a student create a project or assignment, most students are going to make it as easy as possible with no real challenge. There are some that will make it challenging and beneficial, but others won't try and will get no information out of it. If the teacher makes the assignment, they can put the right information that they need to know for the assignment and really challenge the students to actually think about what they are doing. The teacher doesn't have to make it super difficult but find a balance of challenging and able to do. The assignment may take a long time to do but it will help prepare the students.

Sometimes when students get extra help from a tutor or an online program, they get information that they don't need to know and then they study that information. With teacher-designed assignments they can give the students the right information so they know the exact information they need to. While the teacher could just give the student a rubric, the teacher can give specific examples and further information to the students. When the teacher creates the assignment they can also give information and examples that are used in the following year that they will need to know. Getting a head start on information needed for the following year will benefit students a lot, because if they go get extra help they will be ready for the class and know some of the material already.

If the students make the assignment the teacher will have to dig through and try to find all of the information they asked for, but if they make it themselves, all they have to do is check for the parts in the place they are supposed to be at. Lots and lots of teachers always complain about the massive pile of papers they need to grade, but all they have to do is put the information and example in one place and they can just check it off. Also while doing this, the teacher can easily see where the students are struggling and how exactly to help them. Sometimes teachers struggle to find ways to help struggling students because it could be the way the teacher is explaining it or the student just doesnt understand the material. The faster teachers are able to grade the assignments the faster they can help the students because if the assignment isn't graded and it's been too long, the student will be even more lost than before.

Teachers will have the final decision and will choose what they think will help the students learn the most. Some may say that the summer assignments should be student-designed, however, the teacher designed assignments will get the exact information to the student. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students may make the assignments too easy, teachers can give the assignment based on what they learned and what they need to know for the following year and, the teachers will be able to grade it faster and will help get a better understanding about which students are struggling in what areas of the subject.
