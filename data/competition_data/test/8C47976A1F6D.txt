Dear Principal,

I have read your policies you are considering on the usage of cell phones in school, and I think that your second policy, the one allowing cell phones in school and ability to use in only free time, is the best idea.

Yes, I am one who may over-use a cell phone, but that's not the reason I think allowing the use of cell phones is important. There are reasons that the ability to get to a mobile device, such as a cell phone, is important. There can be emergency cases in which a student may not be able to access any other phone, or another person, so the cell phone is easily an accessible option if we, the students, have one with us. If there were one of these emergencies and we didn't have a phone to use, there may not be a way we can get help, endangering ourselves, and possibly others.

Other reasons to have a cell phone on your person can also be very important. There may be a time where we need something from home, but what we need isn't information we would be fond of sharing with others. The cell phones would allow students to call home without being in an office with more than him or herself in the room and when calling your parents for the things you need, it might be stressed a little, if you don't want others around you to know.

These are only a couple of good reasons for you to allow cellular devices in school, and I hope that these few reasons will stress the fact that having a cell phone is a good idea. I strongly suggest you allow them in school for the reasons stated above and others also.

Thank you,

The Students
