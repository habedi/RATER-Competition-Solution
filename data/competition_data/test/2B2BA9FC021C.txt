Dear Principal,

I think that you should not require all students to perform community service. I think this for many reasons. One of the reasons that i think that all students should not perform community service is because some people might not have time to do community service. For example if a student is interested in their sports career and they have to do community service they probably won't have time for their sports career. Another reason is that people might not be in the condition to do community service. For example a student might be disable in any way and they might not be able to do things that community service requires. Also one of the most common reasons is that they might have other things to do. For example they might have to do chores.

I have many more reasons why you should not require all students to do community service if i was to tell you all of them i might be here all night but one thing i have in mind for you to do is give extra credit to the people who do community service because they actually care about the community.

Respectfully Yours,
