BENEFITS OF ATTENDING CLASSES FROM HOME

Talking to someone in person makes it more interactive, than talking on a phone. Imagine if there were no computers at home, what would you do? And how would one study?. Going to school, makes it more interesting and exposes one to a different world. Attending classes from home would help students get a better understanding of what is being thought, develop the skill of communication, and also join other school clubs.

Students would be able to understand better of what is being thought in the class. Sometimes when lessons are being thought in class, one might not get what the teacher said, he or she will then go back to the teacher or even a friend to ask for help. Subjects such as Chemistry, Culinary, Welding, Art and Fashion Marketing, needs more attention and practicals in class. For example, in a Fashion Marketing class where students are told to buy fabrics and sew a piece of garments as their project work. This project work will efficiently be done when helped by the teacher in class rather than it being done at home.

Not only will students get a better understanding in class, but also develop the habit of communicating with others. When students begin to associate themselves with others, they learn how to relate and react with the people around them which builds up a good relationship and teach them how to cooperate with other people.

Notwithstanding the fact that students would be able to get a better understanding of what is being thought in class and also interact with others, they would also be exposed to different school activities and clubs such as, Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, Key Club, Science and Maths Club, Art Club, Dance Club, Drama Club, etc.

In school, they would become more active, develop good relationships, understand studies better, learn the habit of communicating with others and engage themselves in other activities that would help them in the future. Therefore, one would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.
