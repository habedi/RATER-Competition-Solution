Revealing the Face

Have you ever heard of the "Face on Mars"? Well I have. I'm actually a scientist that works for NASA. As a scientist we are constantly getting information from people about their thoughts on the Face on Mars. We get many suggestions, such as the face being created by aliens. Well as a scientist I'm here to tell you it was not created by aliens.

This face on Mars was not created by aliens, but was created by nature itself. The Face on Mars is a natural landform. I know this because as a scientist of NASA we believe this face is just a huge rock formation. This rock resembles a human head. The human head formed by shadows, giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and lastly a mouth. Many authors that have researched on this topic believe it will attract more attention to planet Mars.

The Face on Mars has became a very big deal. It has played a role in movies, showed up in magazine articles, and has been a topic on radio talk shows. Many people have come to conclusion that NASA would rather hid information about this such thing. But NASA just wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

Many people still believe that this artifact came for aliens, but few scientist and have come to believe this is true. NASA takes pictures of the Face on Mars but many aren't satisfied by the quality of the pictures. As a scientist at NASA it is very challenging to capture a good photo because this face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude. This means that the camera has to peer through many wispy clouds to catch the face.

We scientist at NASA have come to conclusion that this Face on Mars isn't created by aliens because of those reasons. Although many others may disagree and believe NASA is hiding information on this artifact. As a scientist that works for NASA, we will continue to look more into this specific topic and hopefully be able to know for a fact that this is created by landform and not aliens.
