No student would want to have projects assigned during summer break, but some students do. Some schools will make it a choice between the projects being teacher-designed or student-designed, and many staff and students would want the projects to be student-designed. The project being student-designed gives students motivation, gives students creativity, and gives students a way of showing his or her knowledge.

Even though staff, teachers, and maybe parents would want the project to be teacher-designed because he or she would not have that much faith in a student. But since it will be a teacher designing the projects students would know what to do and will be able to complete the assignment. Teachers will design the project assignments a little challenging to know where the student is at. What critics failed to consider is that in the eyes of a student, if he or she is being assigned projects over summer break he or she would not want to do it, and then the results of that would be not having the assignments completed. Students will see the project assignments as homework and will not have any motivation to do it.

Having the projects students-designed students will be more motivated to finish the project assignments. Students will be excited to do his or her project. Students will be excited because it is letting him or her have freedom to show the teachers what he or she can do. Students will want to work hard to accomplish the project that was designed by themselves, the student. Students would work hard to see the results of the project. Having the projects student designed will have the students thinking on what one will do for the project so it will help him or her be motivated. Also having the projects student-designed it creates creativity for the students.

With the projects being student-designed it helps students get creative with the projects. Students will have to come up with new ideas on their own to start the project. This also creates freedom of choice for the students. Students will need also explore new ideas, sources, and information. The projects will be student-designed which allows his or her project to be unique so then it will be nice to see the ending results to the project. Then comes the knowledge part.

With the projects being student-designed this allows the teachers to see what the student knows now. Students will show if he or she still knows things from school. Teachers will be able to see what the student is struggling in. Teachers will see what that student is good at and if the students is gaining any new knowledge. This helps teachers to improve their teaching skills or if the teacher needs to slow down and teacher at a slower pace for some students. Teachers will see if the students can use any old knowledge that they have which shows that the student can keep and hold in information that was taught to the students from years ago. Students will also see what they would need to improve, if he or she needs to study more or pay more close attention. Students may even need to ask for help from the teachers. Having the summer project assignments student-designed creates a lot of ideas and new ways to help both the teacher and student succeed in learning.

Some schools have summer projects and there is a choice of the project being teacher-designed or student-designed. A student-deigned project allows students to be more active in the project, allows students to gain creativity, and it allows students to show teachers what he or she know and what he or she does not know. By having the the projects student-designed it creates a new way of helping teachers and students over summer break. A student keeps learning and so does the teacher.
