Automobiles, cars. They've been here for centuries. Without cars we still would be riding horses. Thanks to inventors we now don't have to walk to our destination, tired and glum. These vehicles has help us with a lot of things mainly transportation, but can a little to much of transpotation hurt our enviorment and ourselves? We hurt the enviroment using cars, some of you might not notice because it isn't an everyday thing. The daamages that happen to our home, Earth happens over time. If we just limit car usage you can see will see the progress, but some people will say "no, we will never get anywhere without using our cars". Well Vauban, Germany has some things quite opposite from that.

Vauban, Germany where residents in the community gave up their cars. Vauban was completely a car free zone, except the main thouroughfare. Yes, people still had their cars, the people just couldn't use them. Some people would be quite upset not to have a car, but in Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes ON Without Cars a woman named Heidrun Walter changes that statement. Accordingly to Heidrun Walter a mother of two and a media trainer's perspective she says, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Sometimes riding in a car can be very stressfull having children in the car making noise and if you're late to work, but there is tons of traffic. Giving up cars may help some people be tense free, but another reason Europe gave up cars is to help decrease the percent of green house gases emmisions that cars release in Europe.
