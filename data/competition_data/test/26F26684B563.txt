In the article Driverless Cars Are Coming, the author has a ton of good points for driverless cars such as driverless cars insure more safty on the road. He also made a good point about the negative aspects of driverless cars. What if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer. I am going to make an arguement for the development of these cars, and at the end lets see how you feel about these cars.

The reasons I think that Driverless cars are good for the road are the following. My first reason is that I think that driverless cars will be very safe and will only benefit the driver in the car. My reason for that is driving regularly is very dangerous because of the fact that a lot people driving on the road distract themselves from the road. Like texting and driving, or bending down, and picking up the mccdonalds french fry you just dropped on the floor. With the driverless car you can do that and not be in danger of getting hurt. Actually some manufactures hope to interpret the driving fun in a new way, by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.

My sesond point is what if people say "what if the car system fails". Well in the driverless cars you can still take controll of the wheel whenever you please, and the system will stop. You will sometimes be required to take over the car in certain situations like, navagating through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers have actually created a seat in cars that vibrate to notify when they need to take over. My last reason is that driverless cars overall ensure more saftey because, they brake and have better reaction times then people.

In fact Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. That to me is crazy by the time im twenty i might be able to ride in a driverless car. That is why I agree that we should hope for the development of these cars.
