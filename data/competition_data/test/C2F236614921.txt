Dear principal,

I just want to say if the average is got to be a B then if mostly all the jocks have C average there no one going to be playing because all the jocks are C average. But if you want to put it as B average then do it but i just want to let you know that if you do then mostly ass the good jock or whatever sport there good at they wont be playing until they bring the grade up to a B average.

Everyone likes sports but if you change the average then its not going to work out because all the good player are not going to be playing if you want the school to look bad but at the same time your trying to make it better for us but then all the slackers at the school. They will ruin it plus i don't want to go to a school that has a team at sports that are doing horrible at it i want this school to look good but at the same time look smart.

But i think it will work out either way it goes hopefully because this school great but you have too look in our shoes and be like we want win every sport but yet we have to have are grades up. So i really think its a good thing what your doing but at the same time no.

I think we should have like a vote on if we should have a rule of playing sports having a B average. What if non intelligent kids are not smart but they can play very good at sports like kids from other countries don't speak English and are not smart with English but they are good at sports but the really want to play but they don't have a good enough average.

So to be honest i don't think you should do that rule but at the same time i think its a great rule but some kids just wont out the effort in to have good grades. Like some kids out there want to actually go to collage unlike some kids don't want to even go to high school bummer.
