In the artical Making Mona Lisa Smile the author is describing how a new technology called the Factial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotiolns. No I don't think that using a computer will identify how a person is feeling and what there mood Is for the day. And I say this because what if they not really feeling that way what If they computer is guessing what thart person is really feeling. Like how would you even calculate what the percentage is and how would you even know what number to caculate. Usually how we tell If someone we know Is down Is by there face and you can tell If something happened or If they ae just tired. There is really no need for a computer to try to tell If someone is sad , happy, or mad It's all about your face expression and the way they walk and carry themselfes. When you look back at the text you can see that a classroom computer could recongize when a student is being confused or bored. You really can't though yes it's possible but for now you can't really try to relate to the passage and having computers read your mood and thoughts and feelings. This Is my reason why computers doesnt read minds and thoughts.
