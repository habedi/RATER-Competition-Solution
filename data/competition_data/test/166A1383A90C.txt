If there was an option to ether run into a burning building or stay outside where it is safe, what would most people choose? For many students school is a burning building; it only brings them uncomfort and harm. There are many uncomforts experienced by students, for example, school is put at a set time with distinct locations for every class and specific times for all work to be done. This inflicts stress and no motivation to some students, therefore, if a class is taken at home the student would no longer feel this way, instead they would feel motivated and more prepared to do their work due to the flexibility and comfort of their own home. Students should be able to take classes from home because it provides a comforting environment, flexibility for class time and work, and a safe place without stress.

One of the biggest issues with in-school classes is the specific timing for each lesson, because of this many students must complete piled up work if they ever miss a day. Some kids may not be able to come to school due to problems at home, lack of transportation, financial problems, etc., but by having classes from home they will not need to worry about these issues, instead they will be able to focus of their school work. This also helps their parents. In a typical high school, there is a time in the middle of the day for lunch which includes students needing money to buy food, many parents cannot afford to pay the large amount of money needed for lunch accounts, therefore, the child is left hungry. With online classes however, parents feel comfortable knowing their child is at home where they are able to provide them with food. This also helps kids who are affected or stressed about family or home problems. By eliminating the need of going to school, the extra stress is also eliminated. Issues of attendance are also brought down. During holidays, breaks, vacations, and absences, students are unable to come to school since they are no longer in the area or must attend to some other important business, with in-school classes, students are stressed that they must catch up on missed work upon their return. With online classes they are able to take their work with them wherever they are and are able to learn with flexibility.

Along with being a stressful environment, school inflicts students with unsafe and self contious feelings. Many students undergo the troubles of bulling or judgment in high school which makes them feel contious and insecure, however, by being able to take classes from home, students are able to learn without the fear of being attacked. Bulling has caused many critical problems throughout school all over the world, children suffer from depression, feel the need to inflict harm upon themselves or others, and in some instances, cause devastating events such as school shootings. These tragedies are what make students throughout the nation feel unsafe and threatened. Online classes allow students who feel this way the opportunity to learn in an environment comfortable to them making the education process much more successful. Many students also suffer from mental and/or physical disabilities making learning and the environment of school overwhelming for them. By having the ability to take classes at home both the student as well as their parents would feel safer and more comfortable during the learning process. This can also go for students that have suffered an injury and have trouble moving from class to class, by taking a class online they have the ability to stay home without the stress of traveling between classes or missing assignments during resting periods.

Online classes may cause some minor problems for kids as well. For example, having online classes can be beneficial to many students, however, it depletes them of social and environmental interactions since they will not be exposed to outside interactions. This can be bad for a student because it can limit the number of friend or people introduced to them, however, online classes may also allow the ability of going to other activities due to the flexibility of class time. These other activities can consist of a students interests allowing them to meet others with similar hobbies or experiences. Another problem is the flexibility and restraint when it comes to where or when students must be while taking the class, this can result is the possibility of students slacking or avoiding their work. By avoiding their work they will not get sufficient educational material and cause them to miss critical information for that class, however, this issue can also be avoided if the class requires documents or homework to be submitted for a grade.

Many adults choose to work from home and continue their job in a relaxed environment where they do not have to travel to work, dress up, or stay in an area that does not motivate them. Students should be able to do the same. They are told to be at school at a specific time with an enforced dress code and judgmental people surrounding them everywhere they go with no regard to possible personal problems. By allowing online classes, students only have to worry about their education instead of the impressions others have of them. Solutions to problems such as bulling, self dought, unnecessary stress, and uncomfort are all avoided. If the benefits outweigh the conflicts, it is the better option.
