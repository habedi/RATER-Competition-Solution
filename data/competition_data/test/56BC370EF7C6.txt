If the principal wants to change the school policy by saying that in order to participate in sports, you need to have B average. For this, argument I would say would be weird because most kids in our school try to get good grades, but its really hard for them to do it. The three things that I will talk about is obesity, having fun, and how it would be good/bad in our school if he/she did taking away activities.

If the principal would take away activities, how would we change the obesity rate in this country. Our obesity rate is getting bigger because kids don't do activities as much as they did back then, and today people are always dyeing from obesity. Many people are trying to lose the weight by having to jog or us kids joining an after school activities. Parents always would let there kids sign up for activities so they can make new friends.

BOOM ,RUN, KICK,SCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's the good game of soccer and people having fun and well the old American tradition. Mostly people always do activities and always having fun and that's the whole point of it. Many people in different countries don't have the experience we do. Plus we shouldn't just toss it away like that. Many people in Africa don't even of a ball to play anything and we have that great opportunity to do that.

It would be a good thing for kids to have no activities and to do it on there own time, but it would be really something if kids don't have the time and money to play any activities so they don't do it after all. Some of the reasons it would be a bad thing is that kids would be obesied and kids wouldn't make new friends at all

My argument is that the principal should leave the activities and we will try our best to do what we can and those three topics that I stated are my reasons why we should have activities,and let us kids have something we can do to HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!
