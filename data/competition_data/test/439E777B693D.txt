Have you ever been forced to do something that you don't want to do? Well thats what would be happening if schools required all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Schools should not be allowed to make it a must for students to do extracurricular activities because some kids might not be comfortable with doing an activity at school that shouldn't be required, kids don't want an extra thing on top of school work, and many students might already have plans for after school or their parents aren't able to take their kids to the places they need to go.

Many students might already have plans for at, or during school, or their parents aren't able to take them where they need to be. Not all families can afford cars or transportation, and others might not be able to get to where they need to be because their parents are at work or are busy. A lot of kids play sports, and they have practices often. Students that do have practices often cannot go to an extracurricular activity because of those practices. Other students may have activities that they need to do outside of school. I play soccer and I practice twice a week. That might not sound like a lot, but almost two hours wasted practicing soccer after school, is time I could've used to work on the extracurricular activities that I have to do. When I get home from soccer, I have to study and do homework for my classes instead of doing my extracurricular work. Now that I don't have time to do the activities, I get it trouble for it.

I feel that all kids are already pressured with lots of homework and studying or other things that happen in their life, and students don't want anything else to do other than the activities they already do. Teachers say that they don't assign a lot of homework, dont make us study a lot, or take tests very often. I think that we do get a lot of homework and teachers do expect a lot from us, and just putting more expectations on us that involve activities that we were forced to do and we might not care about, is just not fair. Doing all those things that we need to do for school is hard to do when we also want to have fun in life and play video games all the time instead of doing homework.

Many students are not comfortable with doing an activity at school that shouldn't be required. A lot of students don't want to do sport activities, or school council, or work on the year book because they don't want to be judged on how fast they can run, how good they can kick a ball in sports, or how cool looking they can make the year book look. Students also don't want to just be judged when they might join the student council. Students might have a bullying problem and they want to get home fast so they don't have to keep getting bullied, but they have to go to their extracurricular activity. The bully might be there andkeep harassing that student.

Overall, schools forcing students to do extracurricular activities would not be a good idea because some kids might not be comfortable with doing an activity at school that shouldn't be required, kids don't want an extra thing on top of school work, and many students might already have plans for after school or their parents aren't able to take their kids to the places they need to go. Although extracurricular can benefit student's knowledge, or help them, it isn't a good idea. So next time you hear that a school is thinking about making students do an extracurricular activity, tell them how bad it might end up.
