Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I understand that you are considering changing the cell phone policy to having them at lunch and free times or not having them at all. My classmates and I would appreciate if you would not even think about the second policy and choose the first one.

Students need there phones for many things when they are at school such as calling there parents, reminding a fellow student of class work, or knowing weather or not to go to your house or a friends after school. choosing the second policy may make some students angry and use his or her phone any way which could result in many detentions, serious reprimands, and confiscation of phones. With all of these things happening wouldn't be so much easier just to allow the students to use his or her phones during free periods. Teachers also could also examine the phone to make sure they have not been used before and after class. Many students need his or her phone for various reasons.

I know you do not want to upset any students so it would be in your best interest to stick to policy number one. The phones could also help you by upping turned in homework because the students could remind each other of upcoming assignments. If you did not let them use there phones it could cause scores to actually go down. Nobody wants that right so just stay with policy one.

In conclusion, most of my classmates could not go a day without there phones. I did not know how much easier having a phone made your school life until I got one. I have not parted with it since. If you want happier students go with policy number one.
