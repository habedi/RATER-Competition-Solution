Change The Cell Phone Policy

Dear Principal,

I know that cell phones are a necessity to people today. Everybody has one. A lot of students think negatively of the "no phone's rule." Every kid that has a phone wants to change it. There are pro's and con's to each of these options. I feel like the best though, is Policy 1; allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times. I know students that can't stop texting, during class, even though phones are supposed to stay in lockers. I feel like we should be able to have phones, but we could have designated times to use them. Lunch, is not a "class", it is the only 40 minute break from learning students have. In the hallways is another good example, students have 4 minutes to get to class, they can spend those four minutes however they want, except for texting. That should be changed. Students may need to text mom and tell her that volleyball practice is cancelled. Or that they need gym clothes. It is much easier than running down to the office to call her. I understand that phones can be a disruption from learning.

But, students are more likely to secretly text in class if cell phones aren't allowed. And a lot of students go to their locker, or the bathroom during class just to text. So you have to think, would you rather have kids more worried about texting in class, and not learning; or, paying full attention and knowing that they can text later? A student won't feel a necessity to answer a text right away, and get off task in class, if they know they will be able to at lunch, or in the hallway. I feel that changing the cell phone rule would benefit everyone, from the students, to teachers. It can even benefit you. Teachers will be more focused on class and not worrying about taking phone's away from students. And like I mentioned before, the students won't be so worried about getting caught, and they will focus on their work.

A day with cell phone's allowed, would be a positive influence, just give it a try. Coming from a student, trust me, it will be much, much better. In conclusion I think that changing the schools cell phone policy would be a great idea.

Thanks.
