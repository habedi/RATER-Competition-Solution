Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? No I don't think so because they won't get as much as help they would get face to face. They won't benefit from it. they can cheat on test if they do online classes. They won't consititrent on the work. They won't understand as much.

They can cheat on test or on work that there suppose to do by them self. They can ask people for help while do the tests. Some might say that teachers can video call students during the test. They are wrong because students can have the answers behind the conputer or the lap top tghat their using.

Students won't be able to consititranton work. They will fooling around. They will talk to others while doing there work. Which they won't fouse on work. They will keep moving around. Students can be playing games while taking there online class. They will be texting while doing there classes.

Students won't be getting the help they need from online classes as much as they will get from a teacher face to face. Students going to school will benefit them more because then they will get to school on time. Which at home they will get lazy taking class online. Having a teacher face to face you can ask her for help when ever you needed. Online classes you can't ask for help. Studentd won't understand as much as they will understand from a face to face.

Students should nnot have online classes because they won't learn as much as they would in school. Which it won't help studends that much.
