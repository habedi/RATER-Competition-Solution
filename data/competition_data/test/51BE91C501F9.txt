Dear Principal,

Many people at this age think that community service is just a waste of time. Personally I think that maybe missing a movie or a concert for community service is not so bad. To be honest I even have those times when I am thinking that we have other people to do this and that for us. Although I have also noticed that a helping hand for those people may mean a lot to them. It is also better to volunteer now than to wait until it is to late. I know that people want money but, when you do something good something good will happen to you in return. So, I think that students should take part in community service . I also think that it would be something good to use on a college application so they know that you are able to rearrange your schedule for the help of others. There are many ways to go when it comes to community service. Lets say someone doesn't have the patients to tutor a kid, well maybe they can help clean the freeway. The point of volunteers are to give the time and help to someone else. Many students never know this but one person can make a big difference to three people depending on if they devote the time to help or not. Also some people just like the feeling of knowing they have did a good thing to brighten someone's day and put a smile on a persons face.
