Have you ever thought about how life would be like in the futrure? How technology would develop? or How people would come up with new forms of transportation? Well, what if I told you that someone has developed what is called a driverless car. Yes, a car that steers, accelerates and brakes itself. I will be telling you about some of the pros and cons about using this new technology.

Google has come up with a car that drives itself, but the driverless car still has a long way to go. When it comes to the driverless car you still need a driver in the vehical to take control of the car when it needs to drive through roadwork detours, and traffic accidents. Althought this is still the case, Google is trying many diffrent approches to see how they can improve this technology in many differnt ways.

When it comes to new technology and developments in the world, I am for it. New developments can improve your life, and make it easier. With technolny like the driverless car, even though you may need to take control of the car sometimes overall it's still a very helpful and safe way to maybe answer a call or send a message, and still be safe with your driverless car.
