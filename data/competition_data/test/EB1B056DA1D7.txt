Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to you about the importance of doing community service. I personally think that community service is a key roll in every students lifetime. It shows kids how good their life is and to appreciate everything they have. In our school, I think it would be a great idea to make students do community service hours. They will become nicer and they would also learn something while doing it.

Some students might say that they'd rather be doing something else but 5-10 hours of community service a school year won't kill them. I myself do community service at a local blind children's center. Helping out there really kicks me in the butt showing me how good of a life I have being able to see. I also enjoy doing it because of the kids expressions when I help. They appreciate everything I do for them and that is more rewarding than anything. Appreciative is more how we should be. The kids in our school take everything for granted now-a-days. Doing community service would most likely increase the number of students who are more appreciative and learn that people do have tough lives but we can do something to help them.

Teaching kids in junior high school about the importance of doing community service really could be important in the future. They will help out as an adult and then pass it on to their kids.

As you see, community service is an excellent way to help out society but also to teach kids a lesson. My recommendation to you would be to require community service hours at our school. It will guarantee students to help out our environment/society but also to be a better person throughout their entire lives.

Sincerely yours,
