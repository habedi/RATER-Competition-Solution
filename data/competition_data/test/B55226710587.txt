Dear Principal,

I respect your authority over us, but think about it you could be taking time from us in doing a project or class work. If you make the students clean up the communities trash then they'd get lazy and not clean up anymore and say " Those kids are going to do it anyway." Making a move like that would result or could result in the school going down in grades because kids don't have enough time to study ,or to sleep because they have chores to do. Yeah kids could develop physically ,but what about the fact that the teachers have less time to teach because of everyone cleaning up the community?

What would you feel like if you had to do this at school come home tired then have to do chores as well? I think that making us work during school is wrong especially if we don't get anything out of it. No one should have to do it and i choose the side of no community service during school.

Sincerely ,
