In some areas in Germany, mainly the suburb areas, people don't use cars as often as most people usually do. Car usage is a pretty big problem theese days. Cars  mainly cause pollution, and smog but it also causes some places to ban driving partially. We can potentially stop theese problems if we start to live like some parts of Germany; We can live as a car-free city.

The Earth's pollution is mainly caused by cars. Although we probably will not make a law to ban cars completely in the U.S we can potentially start to live like Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, Germany the residents of this community are suburban pioneers. Living on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss border, Vauban's streets are completely "car free." Vauban has only one place to park-large garages at the edge of development, where a car owner can buy a space for about $40,000, along with a home. In result to this 70 percent do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Vauban completed having no cars in 2006 has grown a trend in Europe, the United States and others to take a step back from auto usage. This movement was called the "smart movement."

Furthermore the cons from using cars so often is mainly pollution and smog. Due to near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In result to this prohibition nearly 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. Traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France. After five days of intensifying smog it trailed toward Beijing, China, wich is known as one of the most pollutted cities inthe world. Diesel fuel was to blame for this. France has a tax policy that favor diesel  over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent of the average diesel engines n the rest of Western Europe. Sure enough the smog cleared fast enough for the French party to rescind the ban of partial driving.

To add on President Obama's abitious goal to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions will recieve assist from an incipient shift in American behavior. U.S, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the world's prime car cultures. After decades of being in love with cars America's love affair with vehicles seems to be going down. If this continues, many sociologists believe it will, it will have a beneeficial implication towards carbon emissions and the environment. Since this happened there has been a large drop in percentage of 16 to 39 years olds from getting a license, while elders are likely to retain their license as they age. Such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are mainly older or buying less cars  in one's lifespan rather than rejecting car culture outright.

In conclusion Car usage has made an impact all across the globe. If we really take this to heart then we can potentially live in a car free city. Limiting car usage is a great way to prevent pollution and smog and also makes our the air more pure rather than breathing in polluted air.
