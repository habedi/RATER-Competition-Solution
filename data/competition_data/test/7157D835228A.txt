Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME.

Today i am here to talk to you about our cell phone policy here at school. Everyone has there different opinion on it. I'm writing this to tell you mine.

My opinion is that we should be allowed to have our phones in school, and use them during lunch, or free times, but have them off in class. i think if we do this students will, or should have them off in class cause we get to us them any other time. if they do have them on in class, this privilege should be taken away. As a student, I would use my phone during lunch, and free periods. when I'm in a class, or not allowed to use it, i wouldn't use it because we can already use it at another time, and if we want to still be able to use our phones in school, i would not use it when I'm not supposed too.

Reason's why we should be able to have our phones in school:

- some students walk home, or ride a bus, in case of emergency, we need phones to contact someone.

- If allowed, to use phones, during free times, students wouldn't be up walking around, yelling across the room, and just be wild. we could text that person, and talk to them that way instead.

- if we earned the right to have our phones in school, we should be able to have them.

one problem would be, not being concentrated in class. i think that as long as you tell them they have to keep there grades up, and earn it, they can have phones. if only a few students haven't earned the right to have there phone in school, they can't have it.

things student's have to do to earn it:

- keep grades up.

- get good grades on test / quizzes.

- be responsible.

- don't get in trouble.

- do what your told.

- no punishments at home.

- listen to parents.

if all goes well, we should be able to have our phones. if it would become a problem, and was not working, it should be taken away. if a student is caught with there phone in class, they should get it taken away, a parent should have to come pick it up, and they can' t use there phone is school anymore. if they proceed to do so, it would get taken away, a referral should be given, along with detention, a phone call home, and a parent would have to pick it up again. thank you for taking the time to read this. i ask you to please take this into consideration.

thank you once again.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
