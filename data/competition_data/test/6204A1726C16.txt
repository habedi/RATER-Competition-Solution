Schools are known to be one of the struggles that all student go through. Because many students struggle with school, online classes and studying from home became an option. However, attending classes in school is more beneficialÂ than taking classes at home, because students focus more in classes at school than at home, and because school is a place where students meet new people and make friendships.

Although some might argue that schools make students stressed, however, schools provide entertaining trips for students, as mentioned before, schools is a place where students make friendships. A

trip with friends helps to overcome stress. Not to add, schools also offer lots of programs and counseling to help out stressed students to overcome their stress.

Taking classes at school helps students be more focused on the lesson that is being discussed in class. For example, when taking classes at home student will have the freedom to do other things while the lesson is being explained, such as using cell phones or talking to people in the same room. This leads to; students not having the full attention and focus on the lesson. This makes students not fully understanding of the lesson and causing them to get bad grades. Since all the attention will be on the lesson at classes in school, students will be focused and will have better grades. Additionally, taking classes at school also gives students the opportunity to ask questions in case of not understanding something, which online classes don't always provide for students.

School is the place where students make friendships and have fun. For instance, when taking classes at home, students will miss the chance to go school dances and make memories. Also, schools help with meeting new people, learning whats wrong and whats right by going through some trouble. This helps students figure out who they are, and who they want to be. When taking classes at home, it will lower the chance for students to meet new people and to figure out who they want to be. That is why classes at school are more helpful.

As can be seen, taking classes at school is more efficient way, than taking classes at home. Even though schools might be stressful, it helps student be more focus on lessons being explained which leads to better grades. And it also helps students to make friendships, have fun, and have memories. That is why taking classes at school should be more supported.
