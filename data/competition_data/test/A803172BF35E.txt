I personally think that the new technology is kinda just interessting. Therefore it can be a good thing to because,"the 3-D computer construscts all major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions, "your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when you are suprised, using video imagery tracks the facial emotions. For example "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face". Dr. Huang obsereves that some artists looked into human anatomy to help them paint their painting. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", which is pretty much a good thing because most students don't like to ask for help on their work. "Most human communication is noverbal, including emotional communication". Most of us don't like to say how we are feeling, thinking or ect, we kinda just show it on our face, like if we're confused, sad, mad, or happy. The new trechonoly could be a good thing for some of us or a bad thing who don't like to say how they are doing or feeling. I think we could use this technology for school mostly because that's where alot of us don't express ourselves as we should.
