As a high school student, i'd like to have some freedom here at school. Being a student isn't easy, but neither is teaching. Many schools around this area allow students to choose their own summer project. Teachers at my school should allow students to choose their own project, because it gives students some freedom to choose what they want,working at your own pace, and choosing your own style of work. Also, working and taking our time and working on our time will show outstanding results.

When a teacher assigns a project, it feels like death;Especially when there's a set due date. Choosing my own due date allows me and any other high school student to get the resources we need for the project. These resources are working at my own pace, ability to think and figure what i'm doing, and finally having time to finish the work. Having the privilege to set your own due date and work at your own ace and time,will help show the work ethic and credibility of the students work. Not having to rush and stress about a project ,also allows to work flowingly and precisely. Lastly, withholding the option to choose your own due date will show how student based projects are better.

Certain styles and formats aren't for everyone. Some do not suit the worker or they just dont work. I'm not saying for everyone, but choosing my own style will be very beneficial for me. First things first, if I have to do the work, why shouldn'tÂ I be able to pick how I want it done. Secondly, I'm not a follower, i'm a trendsetter. Forcing work or something of the sort upon me will show a horrible outcome. Regulating everything i do will drive me insane. Doing something I don't like will tame a lot longer and the work will have very little effort. So clearly, having the option to pick my own way if doing my work will certainly have a wonderful result.

Teacher based projects are even better. Having a skilled and well educated teacher form or reform a students project will result in outstanding grades. Teachers are more educated,has prier knowledge of the topics, and lastly teacher based projects are easier to follow along with. Allowing the teacher to construct the summer projects is very beneficial for students. It gives the students time to prepare, research, and gather all the information they need for their projects. Many students work, waste time, or will never do their work because it's summer time. Although, some students may be responsible , but all aren't and they won't do their work. Furthermore, teacher based projects are better because teachers know what they're teaching and talking about.

In conclusion, student based projects are better and more beneficial for student. They are better and more beneficial because allowing a student to choose the topic , due date, and how it's done will show outstanding grade results and how their work ethic increased over the summer break.
