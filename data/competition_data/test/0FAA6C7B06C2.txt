Dear Principle,

We should not have to do any community service. I think this because kids have other things that they need to worry about. For example, teachers give kids a ton of homework everyday. To be able to do that homework, we need time. Community Service would take away that time to do homework and study for tests.

Another reason why we shouldn't have to do community service is because of extra curricular activities. Kids play all types of sports. They have them on the weekends and on the week days. They also have to fit in the homework factor. There is not enough time in the day to fit in school, homework, extra curricular activities, and community service. We could do it if we would want to, but we should not have to. Many kids don't have the time to fit in all of their extra curricular activities and homework, let alone anything else.

We also have many chores to do at home. This also takes time away to do homework, extra curricular activities, and other things kids might do. Depending on the chore depends on how much time it takes to that particular chore.

Community Service would also take time away from being with friends. Socializing is a big part of teenage lives.

They need to be social. They also have to be active. If they don't already participate in a sport, they might be in a club so they cannot take the time to do any Community Service.

All in all, I do not think that we should have to do community service because it takes up too much time.

Sincerely,
