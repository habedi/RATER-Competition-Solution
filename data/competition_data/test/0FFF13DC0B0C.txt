Dear Principal:

I know that sometimes community service is a very helpful way to get some help with the community , and whoever does it is considered to be a very helpful person. However, some students do community service in ways where it does not involve school. For example, at home with your family: you may be baby-sitting your siblings while your parents go out and have dinner or go to work. Or sometimes you may clean the house for your parents just for them to take a break.

Another reason why maybe some students can't do community service is because they have activities such as sports, chess or church or many more. For example you can't do community service if you have practice for 2 hours, or have to be at church at a certain time for a certain amount of time.

There is some circumstances where not doing community service is a ok because also for another reason why is school. Maybe you like to take your time on your homework and do a nice work, you may have extra credit homework and you also need your study time. Also quality time with your friends and family is sometimes necessary to keep having a strong close connection with them, and community service may take some time away for that.

That's why i say that community service shouldn't be a something that students MUST do. Every student is different in what they have going on after some school. Some students do have time right after school but some need to get to other activities. That's why community service should be an option to students, or in other words a requirement. But certainly not a "must". They shouldn't be forced to bunch up their stuff to their after school life.

Like, your elementary students who clean up litter after school is a small thing but in a strange way it helps you in MANY ways and their not wasting their free time, their actually doing good in the community without even doing much. So, even small things make a change in community that's a reason why i do say that community is good requirement for students who don't do anything or don't do much in the free time they have available. For students like that i think community should be a must requirement but for the rest it wouldn't have to be a must.

This is my opinion on community service. You should probably ask students or do a survey of community and if they have enough time. That way you know if you should do it or not because community service is needed, i understand but however also think like students.

But don't let your community service lower try and get some students to participate in this. It's needed and it's a lovely idea. Very nice of students of helping the community.

This is my opinion on this.

Thank you.
