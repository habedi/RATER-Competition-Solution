PHONES

AT

SCHOOL:

"THE REASON I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE PHONES AT SCHOOL IS BECAUSE WE'RE TEENAGERS AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE IF YOU WILL LET US HAVE CELL PHONES AT SCHOOL ONE REASON IS BECAUSE WE LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO DURING THE BREAKS AT OUR SCHOOL YES WE SHOULDN'T HAVE PHONES AT OUR SCHOOL DURING CLASS BUT WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU LET US HAVE THEM WHILE WE'RE ONE OUR LUNCH BREAKS AND STUFF.

ALSO WE LIKE THINGS TO DO WHILE WE'RE ON OUR LUNCH BREAKS AND AT PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND MUSIC AND THE COMPUTER LABS AND WE WILL PROMISE NOT TO HAVE THEM ON DURING SCHOOL TIME AND ANY TIME THAT THE TEACHERS TELL US THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO TELL US THAT WE ARE FIXING TO GO BACK INTO THE CLASSROOMS AND DO WORK.

I PERSONATLY THINK THAT IF WE BRING THEM TO SCHOOL AND WE HAVE THEM ON DOING SCHOOL TIME(I THINK THE TEACHER SHOULD KEEP IT UNTIL SCHOOL TIME IS OVER AND GIVE IT BACK TO US AFTER SCHOOL TIME IS OVER WITH).THAT IS IT.
