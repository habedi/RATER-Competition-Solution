I think that studying Venus is really worth a try due to the opportunities that we might be able to study its surface.

Even though we do not have the ability to send machines or humans, we would be able to see what things are on its surface

The author shows that it's a worth pursuit in paragraph 7 when he talks about machines like mechanical computers which might be able to make it there.

He says, "systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."

Another example the author gives in paragraph 5 is that humans can go see Venus with its atmosphere with a technology to keep them safe.

The solution would "allow scientists to float above the fray" which is not a bad idea to keep them from getting hit by flames of radiation.

Traveling to Venus would be good because we humans could see how far we can go and we could expand our technology to a whole new level to study other planets too.

It would expand our goal to many horizons to study its many surfaces and this idea to see what's inside of the most dangerous planets in the universe.
