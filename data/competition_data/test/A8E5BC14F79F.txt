Extracurricular activities save lives. That is one of the reasons why I agree with mandatory after school activities. Lots of students in recent years have gotten lazy, bored, and unmotivated. Extracurricular activities can help ease these problems by providing a structured environment for students to learn, explore, and have fun. Extracurricular activities will help students overcome problems by giving them something to do, providing for a safe environment, and helping them make new friends and expand their horizons.

Students will benefit from mandatory extracurricular activities because they will given something fun and exciting to do outside of school. This is beneficiary towards the student because it gives them something outside of school that they can fully engage in. For example, many students play lots of video games. This is fine, but what if the students spends half of that time learning how to code video games. That still fuels a student's passion, but also teaches a useful skill that can be used in the future. After school activities push students to learn new things and expand what they do regularly.

Another way mandatory extracurricular activities will help is by providing for a safe environment outside of school. Students who are at risk to gang violence, drugs, and other issues can find refuge in a safe after school environment. Instead of turning to drugs and falling into crime, students will be given the opportunity to work to provide themselves and their families with a better future. For example, a student living in an underprivileged community may be pressured to join a gang, but he likely won't if he is already busy with sports. There will always be outside pressures that these students will face that make it hard to stay true, but pushing them to join an extracurricular activity may help save their lives.

My final reason is that extracurricular activities will help students make new friends and expand their horizons. Making new diverse friends benefits students and teaches them to work with all sorts of different people. After school activities also teach new and valuable life skills that can help you in the future. For example, going to cooking club can help you learn how to cook, so when you are living alone you can save money eating at home. All of these skills will help a student be successful in life and in jobs.

To conclude, mandatory extracurricular activities will benefit students by giving fun activities to do, providing a safe environment, and helping make new friends and teach new skills. These fun activities help students by teaching them stuff, while also fueling passions. The safe environment helps students ignore outside issues and helps them stay out of trouble. Finally, the new friends and skills will help the student learn to work with people and may help them get jobs. Mandatory after school activities are a great solution to many problems, which is why I agree with this solution.
