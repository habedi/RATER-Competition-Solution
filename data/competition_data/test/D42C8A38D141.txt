Sleepless nights, caffeine, and searing white garage lights scorn the eyes of great pioneer, Steve Jobs. Working hours to complete a crazy dream, even long through the night and summer time. Great ideas and gears thrown into motion, with relentless movement. Steve Jobs didn't create his crazy dream of the iPhone through sleeping in or taking nights off, and neither will students. Modern work forces require a relentless drive and motivation, working 26 hours a day. While a summer grants students a more stress free break, summer projects must be mandated to drive a more continual pursuit of knowledge, alleviate more time during the school year, and give students more passion towards everyday learning.

Students' summer projects give opportunities to continue knowledge long after school has ended. Albert Einstein, in time between studying in school, was employed in a patent office, reviewing designs and inventions. Einstein continued to see innovation even in off hours from studying. Hard work diversifies the thoughts, keeping momentum flowing into the following school year. Even after the factory lights shut off, many workers go home to study and take night classes to finish a degree. Dedication brings about great achievements and flourishing minds of knowledge. Summer projects prepare students for lifelong learning and a work ethic to maintain a steady pace.

Time will also be in more abundance during the school year through preparatory work over the summer. By completing assignments during summer break, Generic_Name and his classmates were able to review content from the previous year once school starts in the fall. When school begins, teachers are playing catch up to find where students are lacking; but with summer assignments, all are given an equal playing field. Being on an even field gets rid of the need to spend time on pointless review. Following the successful completion of the lessons, Generic_Name and his classmates embark on researching a topic learned about during the lesson. In depth review and extensions of knowledge further key concepts to lessons, and build a more versatile student. By completing core fundamentals over the summer, time was able to be allotted to extensions get all actively engaged. Time is vital to learning new information, and can be preserved with summer assignments.

Through the rigor of the classroom during the school year, balance should also be kept in mind. Mental health provides a stable and healthier student, and stress from added assignments will weigh down upon most. Instead of a summer project being detrimental towards stress levels, it will help decrease them by assuring students of past knowledge. Making sure that it's not new content, but better preparing and easing the mind for another successful school year.

Finally, the summertime allows for outside skills of a student to flourish and grow. The marriage of learning and summer fun provides great benefit. Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, built an international brand with a passion to run track and skills used from a marketing class at Stanford University. School fosters the education and the summer gifts the time to do whatever is pleased, and through dedication, they can be brought together. Finding oneself is crucial to development and can be aided by working hard continually. Finding passion in the projects, will find what ones' true interests are. Through taking summer classes at a community college, a student majoring in math finds that he adores computer science. Without outside stress from school life dictating decisions, this student could find his true passion with computers. Finding an ease of mind by utilizing the summer to learn more about everything. Education is something one can always carry, and the passion of learning should never stop.

Stresses may rip away at students, but with successful implication of summer assignments: waves of readiness and preparedness will wash over the students minds to prepare them for the upcoming year. Following the preparedness for school, is the time that will be freed during the school year. Projects will eliminate monotonous hours reviewing and summer projects will continue passion and learning sparked in the children. Through the hard work, passion, and dedication, successful students can be enlightened even more, giving a glowing and resounding future.
