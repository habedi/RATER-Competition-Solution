The author suggests that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because It's bearable for humans, even cars would be able to get on venus.

The author claims Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present. The author supports this idea by stating in the article "...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,but the air pressure would be close to sea level on Eath...Not easy conditions, but survivivable for humans." in that passage the author states even though it may be over heated for humans to live on its bearable and live able to stay on venus.

To support the author's claim the author also states in the passage "... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." the quote also supports the autthors claim because even though, Venus surface is dangerous to be on it would still be able to work if the vehicles don't necessrly have to be on the surface.

The challenge of Exploring Venus is dangerous It's worth givng it a try!
