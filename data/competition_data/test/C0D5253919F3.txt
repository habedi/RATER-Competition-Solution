Venus is one of the brightest stars in the solar system and is consitered to be the "second sun". It is almost as dense as earth and is said to be called "earths twin". The planet has been studied very closely even though we are miles and miles away. The planet is almost impossible to land on. Every spaceship that has landed has crashed or dissapeared. The atmosphere is so dense taking a regular iphone there would melt entering each layer of the atmophere.

The most challenging point to venus is it's atmospheric pressure which is ninety times greater then earth and has the ground tempurature eight hundred degrees fairenheit. Scientists have seeen many volcanos and lightning outbursts very close in intrevals of time on Venus which can make landing and space travel difficult. NASA says orbiting, "At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth." Which means the ground would "liquify metal".

Since Venus is one of the closest planets we could possibly travel too. NASA has been experimenting and planning. NASA has been planning to bring back the mechanical computer from World War Two, to bring into space because of its dense steel and metals. Some may contemplate Venus is just a rock planet and empty. Scientist have discovered that Venus has has earth's features like, "rocks, craters, valleys, and mountains". Even though Venus is far away and is very dangerous our society is curious and will grow until the journey to Venus and back is accomplished.
