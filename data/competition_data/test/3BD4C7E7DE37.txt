Hello i'm Generic_Name and i'm here to talk about an idea i've heard that just sounds crazy. Do you ever want to go home after a long day at school and want to relax, eat, or even nap? Well with this idea of requiring all students to do an after school activity completely kills the relaxing dream. I believe these three reasons should give you an idea on why we should not be required to do an extracurricular activity. First after a long day at school we are tired, students also might be independent or antisocial, finally some kids are not healthy enough to be doing after school activities. These are all things the principal should take to account before implementing this idea.

First reason I believe we should be allowed to choose if we do an activity after school is that we the students are very tired in the regard that we wake up extremely early and must get ready to go to school. Another example of being tired is after waking up for school we proceed to work for 7hrs and learn. The final piece of evidence is that we through out the school day we do not get time to relax and take a breather to process all this information we took in for the day. so after all this going through our day we definitely need a break to relax. I dont know about you but I definitely need a nap after such a day. These are just some examples on why students would be tired and not want to do extracurricular activities.

The second reason we should be offered a choice to do after school activities is that lots of teens in this day and age are independent or antisocial. Some kids would prefer to work alone and just be by themselves. I know when I work alone I plug my headphones in and crank the volume to my music and jam along while I work or play. Another preference for students is that being in the comfort of your home and knowing your alone and can say whatever you want makes them feel comfortable and helps them focus on working. The final reason that some kids prefer to be independent is that you dont have to worry someone else is smarter or better than you. you can just know that you are the only person you have to worry about and being alone helps with that. In my personal life I know some people judge and that would slow me down and i would focus on there comment. So being independent is another reason I would dislike the after school idea.

The third and final reason I disagree with this decision is that, some teens are in health matters and are not healthy enough to do things after school. If a child has a mental barrier or a setback that can stop them from performing like other students. I know about some kids that have speech impediments so if they were to play on a sports team it would be extremely challenging because communication is important. A lot of teens in America are also overweight and are not cut out for playing sports or being on a team. Finally some kids are injured and are healing with a cast or a neck brace, witch stops them from participating in sports or writing if they cannot use there dominant hand. I had an infection in my finger not long ago and I take piano so when i tried to play I was stopped by the injury and it was holding me down.

So in conclusion to all these reasons, being tired after a long day at school, having health issues or injures, and having a preference of being alone, I still believe that we should be offered the choice and power to choose if we would like to participate in an extracurricular activity. Just think about how nice it would be to get to relax after the long stressful day at at school. Besides teachers or adults dont want to have to deal with kids after they did for a whole day right? So I hope that this idea is just an idea and we should think about the challenges kids face and keep things the way they are. I love being able to go home crack open a water bottle have a apple and watch YouTube. Wouldnt teachers like the same to just skip the after school stress?
