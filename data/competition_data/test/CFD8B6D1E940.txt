The topic of driverless cars is contradictive as both good and bad asspects of driverless cars have support. In my opinion completely driverless cars are unsafe while on the other hand cars that are autonomous but still allow for manual driver control are more reliable than both driver required and driverless cars. Entirely driverless cars are unpredictable as stated in the article in the case of an accident if technology fails is the driver at fault or the manufacturer if the car is completely autonomous. As technology developes i believe autonomous car systems will become more reliable but they should never completely replace a human driver as malfunctioning equipment can put pssengers as well as pedestrians lives at risk. In conclusion a line must define human and technological error on the road. Autonomous systems can be extremely helpfull and dependable while driving but should we as a species while we progress eliminate human interaction with our vehicals and can this lead to issues with driverless car systems.
