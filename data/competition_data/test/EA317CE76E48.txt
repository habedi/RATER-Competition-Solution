The summer before the upcoming school year, many schools require students to do a summer project. These projects are usually designed to make sure that the students are still learning over their break. When these projects are assigned, the teachers are in charge of what the project is going to be about. Most students feel as if they should decide what the project should be about. I believe that teachers should design summer projects because when the following school year comes along the project will go along with what they are about to learn, the students would be challenged, and it would be overall more beneficial to the students as a whole.

When teachers design a project, it always has some sort of purpose behind it. Assigning these projects over the summer would allow students to have a start on the lesson before the school year starts. The students would have an idea of what they would be learning about the upcoming school year. With this advantage, teachers would use time in the classroom more effectively. This will also cause students to have the thought of school already in their mind.

Another factor to look into when teachers design the summer projects, it would create a challenge for the students. If the students were in charge of designing a project, then they are most likely to pick something that doesn't require a lot of thought. As a teacher, their job is to generate the students' mind. Designing challenging projects would do just that. This would cause students to have the urge to learn more about the project. Also, when they get back to school they would have numerous questions about the project.

Although some may say that if teacher-designed projects are implemented, then the students may not be interested. Simply because of the fact that it is not a topic they particularly want to learn about. While that may be true, ultimately it would be more beneficial the students if the teacher designed them. If the students creates the project, then they could possibly pick a topic that doesn't really benefit them in the future. When the teachers create the project, the students are more likely to get something out of the project.

In closing, teachers should design the summer projects. This decision would benefit the students as whole. It would guarantee that the students are actually learning during the summer. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about students making a project that didn't require a lot of thinking. Also, it would cause teachers to not start a completely fresh lesson when the school year starts. The whole idea of summer projects is to continue learning outside the ten month school year, that can't happen if the students are in charge of the other two months.Â
