I know this Face is just a natural landform because, in passage 5, its says, "some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide". This shows that people are going against what scientist are saying and that people have opinons that this is just a natural landform, and that this was naturally formed on Mars.

Also, people have taken pictures of this landform with a camera that is ten times sharper than the Viking photos, stated in passage 7. After they took these pictures with this high tech camera it showed there was no alien monument. When this landform was made and the first photo was shown it formed a humans face, it didn't form an alien. In passage 3 it says, "illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth" of a human being.

If a alien were to make this landform they would probably make it of them, something that actually looks like them not some other creature, like a human. "When the camera was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 it was cloudy on the Red Planet". While they were searching they never seen Alien markings.

So therfore, the clouds being so cloudy the alien markings where shown as never visible because, they were covered if there was any alien markings but, the camera shows there is no alien markings and that this is a natural landform. Some people have there opinons on if this was reall made by an alien but very few scientist believe this was made by an alien although some do. This is why I say that this is a natural landform and is not made by any type of alien in any form and that this landforn looks naturally made on Mars.
