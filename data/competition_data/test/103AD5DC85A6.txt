The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Lisa smile never smiles she was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful adn 2 percent angry. Well to to me she was most likely angry if she never smiled when using technology you need to make it have a tester that will know everything before making it I feel like they should make a robot but before putting it out have a tester. I see the author asked can we caculate emotions like math well when doing math you have to learn anf figure out well to find out how someone is feeling you have do all of that to get the answer.

The author also asked how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movmetns well by making a robot that is like a human but very 100 percent truth- 3-D.The author says the facial expressions of reach emotion are universal, well you wouldnt know that unless you make a robot and find out if it would work there shoukd be a tester before puting it our.

I see the author has said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday but we human all are not the same it says we can probably tell how a friend is doing by how they face look well I walk around with a serious face people think im mad but im not see when you talk about doing all of this wanting to making things make sure you know what you talking about and that everything is working perfect.

If the technology gets made hopefully Lisa smile is 100 pecent happy. Teachers would need this just in case a student is mad and the teacher gets yelled at they would know like dang ok she or he is mad. So I think the technology should get made but before putting it out make sure it is working and that it tells the truth on how people is feeling and their emotions.
