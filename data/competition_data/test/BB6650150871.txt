The belief that limiting car use is an obtainable goal in today's world is a foolish one. We as a race of animals have developed technology that advances and propels us pass our old habits as early humans. Depriving people of the luxury of new age technology is a ludacris form of solving enviornmental problems. There is without a doubt an epidemic involving pollution in the world, but it should not be solved by prohibiting whole cities from the benefits of automobiles, the solution is solved by the contrary, which is supporting automobile purchase. What I mean by this is support of cars that have byproducts like water rather than harmful emission.

Cars with zero emission technology are usually hybrid vehicles that run on alternative fuel sources, which help in the preservation of fossil fuels. I believe just the support and production of a lot more hybrid models by all popular car manafacturers is a more feasible solution than trying to remove cars out of the  entire equation. Vauban, Germany  along with Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia all have tried this method and have found success, but their success is only temporary for the solution to this problem is not as simple as just banning car use in cities. Thats my story and I'm stickin to it.

THIS TEST IS UNIMPORTANT
