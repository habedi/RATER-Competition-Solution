Many places in Europe, Paris, Colombia, and The United States have all had a "car-free day" or less driving each year. These changes have showed such a drastic change in lower air pollution and smog in the atmospher. As well as less pollution there has been a drastic change in amount of crowed areas, and less driving. These are all advantages, as well as the less amount spent on car and license plates in each of these cities. Limiting car usage has such a drastic change on the enviorment as well as the citzens pockets.

"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.."  (Source 1) Paris enforced a partial driving ban to have cleaner air after almost reaching a new record for polluted air. Paris has much more smog and polluted areas than Europeans capitals which are known as the most conjested areas. In Bogota, Colombia many people rode on buses and bikes and even walked to there destination on car-free days to reduce smog. Those who did not follow the rule where fined up to 25$.  A businessman Carlos, rode a two- seat bike for him and his wife and stated, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower aur pollution." After this huge event other Colombian cities joined this event for advantages of low pollution. In the United State, "Has America passed peak driving?" (Source 4) In 2005 there was a show in less driving and since it has decreased. If this decreasing of driving continues to change there will be such a huge advantage on the air pollution from cars. As well as less air pollution, the change in driving cars and "car-free days" has lead to less overloading areas and conjestion.
