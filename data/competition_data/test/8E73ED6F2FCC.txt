Did you know a recent study showed that 67 percent of high school graduates wish they could have been more involved with their school? Well it's true. Most schools always provide extra activities and ways to help out your community through your school so why shouldn't we take advantage of that? Being forced to take those extra circulars will help students who didnt know those were an option, open their eyes to a new world of possibilities and fun. Staff should require students to take extra circular activities with the school.

These activities will help students create great, new, long lasting friendships! Say you just moved to my school and you have very little to no friends, doing these extra activities will help introduce you to new people. When you sign up for something that you enjoy spending your time on, and you meet people there, why not be friends with them? You are building a relationship with people who enjoy the same things as you!

Even if you may not want to sign up for a extra activities, you may end up liking it. When your doing these clubs/activities/extra circulars, they could become your new hobby. Sammy Maple, soccer player for the Men's U.S. Soccer Team, said that he was first introduced to soccer at a young age because his elementary school asked everyone one sign up for a club, and he chose soccer club. From then on, Sammy kept playing and practicing and soon everyone around him saw the pure gift he had for the sport. You can benefit from these opportunities provided through your school in so many ways.

Being required to take extra circulars can help you build skills. Skills for the workplace, for a future job, or even people skills. In dog walking club we have to make fliers to promote our club so we get clients. I was in charge of making them, hanging them up, and handing them out to people. When making them I learned not to be to wordy with the fliers so they are easy to ready. Next, I learned that when you hand them out, never give them out to people who are not aware of their surroundings. For example do not bombard someone who is on the phone to give them one of your beautifully made fliers. I can use that information if I would ever want to pursue the job of being a sales person or a graphic designer. These are things they can not teach you in any regular science or math class. These activities teach you valuable things.

I have come to see that most people will say that we should not be required to take extra circulars because they take too much energy away from us that could be used in school. Mostly student who are in the more active sports clubs have said this. I disagree with their claim because there are so many different types of clubs and activities you can choose from. If you find yourself having no energy to do homework because you are in the basketball club, maybe you could join the homework club and then play basketball at home with the energy you saved. If you stayed up late the night before and don't have the energy to participate in volleyball club, then you can join the craft club and sit around while painting. There should be no reason that you wouldnt want to join one of the many amazing clubs!

Getting involved with your school is a very important part of your education and can be very beneficial. University of South Carolina of computer math conducted a survey on how many of their 4 year graduates participated in more than 3 extra circulars throughout their high school career. Over 93 percent said yes and the other 7 percent claimed they were part of a home school group. As you can see, that 93 percent definitely got the benefits from those extra circulars.

A take away from reading my essay should be that the school system, and staff have your best interest in mind and want to help. They should do their part in helping us get the best out of our education and require us do take extra circulars.
