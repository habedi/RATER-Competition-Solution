The reason I, the scientist think and know that the face is just a natural landform is because, we have pictures of Mars and the "face" picture.

The first reason why my claim is true is because firstly, there is NO proof of life being on Mars of all the years it has existed and there could possibly be no life on that planet because there is NO way that there could be life on Mars, because of its condition. Mars is NOT fit for humans to live on or any other natural organism. I'm not just saying a that a human could live on the planet but, you wouldn't even last 5 seconds on Mars. In fact, Mars has volcanoes. Maybe its just a lava dome? Who knows? But what we do know is that there could possibly be no sign of any human or other organisms on planet Mars. On April 5, 1998, when the Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a pictures ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. And justin that picture, there was no proof of any supernatural life (alien) life or human monument on Mars.
