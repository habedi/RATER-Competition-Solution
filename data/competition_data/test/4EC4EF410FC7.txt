I do not want to retake this year, but I also do not want to miss my soccer practice. What would I do? If my school made it a requirement to take extra school lessons like sports, yearbooks, or student council would I agree or not. I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed.

Doing the required activities means the activities will give out homework. Many students already have enough homework in their daily bases, and while taking another activity can increase more time on homework and shorten other activities the students would like to enjoy. After school I like taking naps, but if I have lots of homework then I would not be able to do so. Some students may have tests the following day and would like to study for it, but having more homework the student may not study as much as they would like to. In conclusion students already have enough homework and should not have to take extra activities and get more homework.

Many students have activities after school they do on their own time. Some students, like myself, may have more than one activity they are balancing. I have soccer, piano, and swimming that happens every week, and if I take school activities then I would not be able to take my own lessons. When students are required to take school activities their schedule might not have enough time to do the their own activity. If students do not take the required activity they might repeat a year, and many students would not like to retake a hard year. Although there are lots of people who also do not take activities it would be crucial to the kids that do. In conclusion when students take other activities outside of school and are required to take extracurricular activities students would not be able to their own.

If every single student is taking the extracurricular activity that would make the school crowded. When taking other activities it wouldn't be like taking normal school lessons, because there may be more people taking one activity and there would not be enough room for the students. If everyone would take the sports activity the school would not have enough gyms for everyone to go to. In conclusion if a students are required to take extra activities the school would not have enough rooms or activities.

I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed. If the principle decides to do these activities they should let the activities be somewhere outside of school. Allowing the activities not to have homework would also be really helpful. The school should also make the activities on some days and not everyday so students have other things to do they can do the school activity on another day. Although these would be helpful the extracurricular classes should not be required.
