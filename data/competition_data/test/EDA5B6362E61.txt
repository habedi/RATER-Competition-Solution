The author gives several points as to why exploring Venus is a good move scientifically. For one, it could provide some information regarding how our planets were formed. Venus is the sister planet to Earth, and as the passage says, it could've once had the capabilities of sustaining life, and exploring it might give some insight on what caused it to become so uninhabitable. The fact that all previous attempts to land spacecraft on Venus, well, didn't work, designing a machine that is able to withstand the harsh conditions that Venus presents is pretty challenging, but

NASA claims it can be done. They say having a vehicle floating abouve the chaos that is Venus' atmosphere would be feasable. we'd also have to take a step back in the technology department. Mechanical computers, which were a huge help in WWll, don't require electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. Another possibility is simplified electronics, made from silicon carbide. The simplified devices have been tested in conditions similar to Venus, and lasted for three weeks.

So while exploring Venus will prove to be a great challenge, it can be done.
