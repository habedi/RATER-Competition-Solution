Extracurricular activities are after school activities that students participate in. For example, GEMS,touting,cheer, and yearbook. I believe students should have a choice on whether or not they would like to participate in a after school activity. I dont not agree on the principal making the decision for students on having to join a extracurricular activity, because students may already have enough going on in school as it is, students may not just want to do it, and students may already be participating in another activity out of school.

Me being a student I already know the stress that other students have to go through everyday. Students, like myself, struggle and stress over many subjects and do not want added on stress by having to join a extracurricular activity. For example, I have a really hard time in Math and Spanish, and I try my best in these classes by staying after for help whenever I get a chance, or I always ask a lot of question in class so I can get a better understanding of things. Every time I take a test or a quiz in one of those classes I nearly pass or just fail. By me already having stress over Math and Spanish, joining a club or sport will add on more stress because not only do I have to stay after to get help for Spanish and Math I would also have to stay after for my club or sport and eventually my schedule may end up running into one another.

After a long day of school kids like to go home and relax, eat, watch TV, or just go to sleep and wake up for the next day. In my option theres nothing wrong with wanting to be lazy after a long day of hard work. For example, the whole school day I have been testing and taking quizzes in ever class I have been in, and I just want to go home and and go straight to bed because I am tired from all the work I have been doing all today. Well by me being in a club I would have to stay after and do even more work, and what fun is that. Students do not want to be reminded of more and more doing this and that, we would like to just free of school and not reminded of it all the time.

I feel like athletes have the most stress on them,because not only do they have to do good in school and keep up with there grades,but they also have to be on time for practice, travel from one state to state, and they also miss out on many school events they student enjoy going to. I give them all the praise,because I know its stressful to maintain every thing they have going on. For instance, my friend Generic_Name is plays Softball and she complains to me all the time how she is stressed over how she has to go to practice then come home and do all her homework from the different classes she has. Another example, my friend Generic_Name does Competitive Cheer and tells me all the time how she wishes to attend different events that we have for are school but cant because of practice. Now if these two student had to pick a club to join what time in there schedule would they have to maintain to every thing all at once.

I believe students should have a say on whether or not they would like to join a extracurricular activity , because it is there life. I do not think students should be forced to do something they might not wish to do. I do believe the that the principle should educate us more on the different clubs and sports we have. If it was up to me I would just let students decide on what they wish to do what themselves because making a extracurricular activity a priority for will cause many of them stress which I have prove from my evidence.
