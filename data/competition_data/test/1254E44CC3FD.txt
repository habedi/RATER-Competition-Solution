Yes it is valuable. Why? It is because you can use it to see if the student is really paying attention or not. You can also tell if the student is bored or depressed so the you can do something about that. like it was said in the article about Making Mona Lisa Smile. This technology can tell you wether the person is happy or not. just by seeing the face that the kid or anyone is making which this will come in handy for others in the future to know. And all they have to do is use this technolghy to see wether you are really liking something or wether you are really hating something. not only that it also see that if you are making more than one expression in your image.

In conclusion, i say that this techology is nit just good in all schools around the world but good to use in everyones daily lifes and can be used to help people in hospitals and all over the world, it can be used to stop crin=mes and used to see wether someone is lieing or not. or to even indicate what the person is probably thinking or planning to do.
