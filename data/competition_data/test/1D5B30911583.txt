Venus is a mystery planet but is also very similar to earth. Why havent we explored it yet? Venus should be explored because it is fairly close to us sometimes in the year. Venus also shares a lot of characteristics with earth. If humans were able to explore Venus then we would possibly be able to make a new planet livable to humans and also give us much more knowledge about space and planets.

Sometimes Venus is closer to Earth than Mars. In paragragh 2 it states that,

"Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too." We are starting to learn about mars and if Venus is close to earth when mars is far then we should have no excuse not to explore Venus.

Since Venus is so close to Earth then we could possibly make a new livable planet and also have a whole new line of information for scientists to study and explore with.
