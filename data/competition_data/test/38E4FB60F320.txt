Summer break isnt that supposed to be about enjoying summer, not doing what your teacher assigned to you. If there was a summer project I think students should be able to design their own project not have a teacher designed project. The point of summer break is not to do school work. Most students think that teacher assigned work is boring and annoying. If there was a summer project students would much rather it be designed by them and for them.

All school year students get work assigned from teachers day after day. They have 8 hours of school a day then comes the homework over night. The work is mostly about stuff we will never learn to use in life or we just dont car about and will forget the next day anyway. The work is long and stressful and very hard at times. students need a break from all that hard and exhausting work.

The work teachers assigned to student is about as boring as it gets. it all essay this and that when does it stop. Then the homework is even more annoying and boring. In school the work is all assigned by the teacher, and they expect you to enjoy it as much as they do.

If students delighted their own project it would be more interesting and they would actually take their time and make it enjoyable. Students know their strengths and weaknesses and could focus on what they are good at to get a good grade. Students in the summer would know what they have time to do and if they wanted to take more time to get something accomplished they dont have a due date to go by they have more time .

Is a summer project was student designed I think it would have a greater outcome of student completion and student satisfactory. Students wouldnt be stressed or exhausted after they finish the project. They could used their strength and weaknesses to their advantage to get a good grade. The work wouldnt be assigned by some teacher who they had last year. The work would be assigned by a the students for the students.Â
