Experiments and new ideas are paving the way for new cultural changes. Cars are emitting more and more pollution every year. Researchers and studies show that by limiting the use of motorized vehicles the harmful gases trapped inside the ozone will eventually diminsh.

In Vauban, Germany they have given up theirs cars. "Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in ths experimental new district" says Elisabeth Rosenthal. According to the article, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not even own a car, and 57 percent sold their car just so they could move into this suburban lifestyle.

Paris, France decided to give this experiment a try. After five days France recorded that 60 percent of the capitals congestion went down. This has made more clear skys and easier breathing habits for residents.

The United States is now thinking about trying this new change. Researches say that since the recession not many people are buying cars now a days. They dont have a need for them as much as they did before. Numbers have been going down steadily since 2005. "If this pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmsions and the environment" says Elsiabeth Rosenthal.

With this new cultural shift, it could be better for people, industries and most importantly the air we breath!
