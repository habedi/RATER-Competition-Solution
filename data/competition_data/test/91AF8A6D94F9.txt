In my opinion i dont think they can tell what peoples emotions are by looking at a computers because everyone act different ways. For example you can't say just a person is not surprised because they didn't raise their eyebrows.. There is no one way to act for emotion because different people act different way. You can look emotions like math homework because you can tell if math is right or wrong but you can't do that with emtions because it's not fact. For example there are some people who dont show any emtion for anything can't tell me that they are not happy because they dont have smile in their face. I know a guy who gos to my school and he never shows any emtions. For example when he gets a good grade in his geometry test that doesn't mean he is anger. I think it is hard to juge peoples feeling by their face. Some people smile all the time that doesn't mean they have everything perfacts. You can't juge book by it's cover and it is the same for emtion. A book can look old and boring but when you read it you might like it. It's crazy how we think technolohy will know all this things. It seems as if technology is taking over the world now. If we think it can tell are emtion by just looking at a picture of a person what is next our life story? Overall, I don't think you can tell peoples emtions by technology.
