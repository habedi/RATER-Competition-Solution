I think all students shouldn't have to do community service hours. I think if some of the students want to do the community service hours then they could volunteer for it. For example, the students who want to do community service hours could sign up in the offices, library, classes, etc. Not all students should have to do the community service hours because some of us have things to do after school, at home, or maybe we have to be places that are very important. Some of the students who wouldn't want to do community service hours maybe want to go home and relax, clean up around the house, or spend time with their family. It's not that the students that don't volunteer don't want to do community service hours just because, there's always a reason for it. The students who do want to do the community service hours, should maybe get a reward for helping out with our community and the people in it. If the principal wants for all the students to do community service hours, then maybe they could find a way to take a little time from school. if not that, then I don't think all the students would do community service hours. I'm sure that most if the students will agree with this opinion, and some other students may not. Maybe another way to do community service hours if all students will have to, is the classes could go on field trips to places that need community service, if not that at the most, then at the least the students who have gym classes could go outside and clean up around the school area and earn their community service hours that way. helping our community is very important, but not all students will agree to doing it for whatever reason they have. I think the students shouldn't be forced into doing community service hours.
