Driverless cars are coming. Driverless cars would be a great thing to do because there would be way less crashes. Sensors can stop the car when in danger. The sensors can also reduce the amount of power from the engine. Position estimating sensor on left rear wheel stops the car when backing up almost into asomething you cant see. Another thing that the sensors could do is make sure the driver has hands on the wheel.

The good in these driverless cars is that there would be less lives at risk. There would definatley be less crashes in the united states. Another thing driverless cars can do is save lives on the road and off the road as a pedestrian. The last thing that driverless cars are good is when your in bad traffic the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but the sensors make sure hands are on the wheel.

The bad in the driverless cars is that the driver dont want to wait fot their turn to drive. Dr. Werner Huber said that we have to interpret the driving in a new way. In some states they wont allow to test these smart cars except, california, nevada, florida, and district of columbia they have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomonous cars. If something bad happens like the cars technology fails the manufacturer is the blame for it all.
