The article 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is very convincing. The author had many great points and was also compairing Venus to Earth. Definitly will grab your attention. A really great con of exploring Venus is that it has many common things to Earth. In paragraph 2 it states that Venus is often referred to Earth as a twin. Also it states that Venus is the second planet in our solar system. Another con why Venus is a great topic to explore is that if there was ever a time in a life time that we had to live in another world, Venus is the answer to that problem. In paragraph 5 it states that

NASA has particulary compelling ideas for sending humans to study Venus, but it the temperatures would be toasty at sorund 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Not easy conditiond, but survivable for humans.

Over alll I think we should continue reaseaching about Venus and exploring Venus, not only because it would help us humans learn more about our solar system, but it could be a new home for our community.
