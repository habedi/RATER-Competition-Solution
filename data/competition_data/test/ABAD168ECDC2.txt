Have you herd of the cowboy that rode the waves in the pacific ocean? Well if you have not I will tell you about him and his long trips. He grew up on a farm so that is why he is such a hard worker. In 1945 the war was over in urop and 44 regions came toghter to help all over the other countrys that were Europ and needed re- built. So that is when Luke comes in. His freind over in Europ invited him to try one trip. After one trip he was in love with helping people by going over sea`s and giving people cattle. He was on late night watch and it was rainy,he slipped of the latter and hit a metal pice the broke his ribs. After that in 1947 he was discharged from the boat and his duty so he went back home to the U.S.A. The war was over then and he worked two jobs. Do you belive that Luke and his freinds really rode the waves of the pacific ocean and did it six-teen times? Would go out there and go out there and do it yourself? Well I would and I would like to help others and there famly and freinds.
