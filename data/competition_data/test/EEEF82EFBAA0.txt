The "face" on mars is indeed not actually a face at all and it was not created by aliens. Many people may think it was. Based on all of the facts that we have gathered here at NASA, the claims of this rock formation being created by terrestrials is simply not true.

Here at NASA we have the equipment to tell us if it is terrestrial or not. One thing we discovered in our research was throughout the years that we have taken these photographs that the "face" has started to just look like a big rock. It was due to the shading that the "face" looked like it had eyes and a nose.

We also discovered that the rock formation is much like some of the formations here on Earth. All of the Earth formations were caused naturally and not by aliens. The fact that it was a cloudy season when the last picture was taken is true. Although in the picture we can see that it was clear.

In conclusion with all of the facts we have found this is indeed not a face created by aliens. There is enough evidence to tell us this. If it was an alien structure then we would benefit from it. We could learn about how advanced they were, but this was not created by aliens. It was simply just a messa or rock formation that looked like a face do to the sunlight that caused the shaded regions.
