Dear principal,

I see that you want to reconsider two possible polices about the cell phone.

The policy that I think is better is actually both i think that students should be able to use cell phones during free time. Not during class time also i understand that many students like to use their phones a lot which you should may consider to let them use their during at least lunch or free time but not during classroom time which is very important for the students education. To learn for example when your done with a test and you have free time to text ,call ,and etc. While other students may lose concentration during their test so its better to use their cell phones during at least lunch or other free times but not in class or other important event that is happening during school time cause that is really disrespectful. Also it would be unfair that students aren't allow to have a phone. For example if their is an emergency and no one has a phone and it will cause a problem to the school .Which I consider at least a little of both policies. So you want to consider at least policy 1 and a little of policy 2 of which I want to consider you a policy3 and in this policy you may to use your phone during lunch or any free time but can't be use during class time or any important events happening during school unless its and emergency of some kind. And students would be able to have their phones cause you never know something bad would happen.

Sincerely,

Student
