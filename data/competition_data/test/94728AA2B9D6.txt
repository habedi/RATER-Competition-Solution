Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I recently heard that you have been considering changing the grade average required in order to participate in sports or other school activities. Right now the average grade must be a C or higher in order to participate in some school activities. I believe it is a wise decision to change the requirement from a C to a B. By doing this, you will push your students harder to achieve their goals and end up with a higher amount of kids getting B' s!

I am currently a member of the schools wrestling team and I know that I would not want to come to school on some days if it weren't for wrestling practice. I can tell you that every other member on the wrestling team feels exactly the same way! If you challenged those kids to get a B average I am sure they would do their very best. This would teach them discipline and let them know that they are rewarded for good schoolwork. The students might feel like they are only trying in school so that they can partake in school activities but truly they will be helping themselves in the long run as well!

Once your students get to a high school or college they will soon learn that they need to get their grades as high as possible in order to be as successful as you want. By giving them these goals early, they will be preparing for what is soon to come. Also, when your students are in high school and are succeeding in their classes you will receive recognition for teaching them their ways.

I know that you will make the choice that you believe is best for the students and best for the school. I believe that you should change the grade average requirement to a B because more kids will persevere to get their grades up to a B and help them prepare for their future school experiences. It is important to teach your students that they are rewarded for good work and that doing good in school can only lead to more good things.
