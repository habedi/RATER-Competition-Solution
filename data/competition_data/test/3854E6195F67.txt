Have you ever wishes you could read the emotions of another person? With new technology created by Thomas Huang you can do just that. This device allows you to precicly calculate the emotions and feelings of anoother person. But would it be valuable in a classroom of students.

In my personal opinion i say yes it would be valuable. I think it would not only be valuable to students but also to teachers. It would be helpfull to students because say for example you have a crush on a fellow classmate but dosent know how she feels about you with a app called snapchat you are able to communicate through pictures, so if you knew how she felt about the conversation based on the selfie she sent it would give you a accurate idea of how she feels about you. A reason i think it would be helpfull to teachers is it would allow them to know when a kid becomes bored or sleepy ultimatly helping on how to teach and what subjects catches your class attention.

So do i think that it is a good idea to have a emotion detector in a classroom. Over all yes because it has it's pro's such ass helping a student with his crush or helping a teacher deliver a lesson planor know when a student it sleeping. But it can also have its con's. So when deciding to put one in a classroom of your own dont only look at the neggatives or posotives but compare and see which outways the other.
