Dear Principal,

Community service is a very important thing. It helps things to get done quicker and easier sometimes. It can sometimes help others less fortunate than you are. Community service can educate children to be less self-absorbed, and more caring about others. I believe that community service should be mandatory for all students at this school.

All students should have to do community service because it could teach us to be more responsible, which would help out a lot when we got older. Having to do community service would kind of be like having a job. You have a certain thing that will be expected of you and certain times you are suppose to be there. Making students aware of this would be better prepare them for the future when they do have a job. Giving students tasks, community service jobs, would teach them to be more responsible. They would have something expected of them, and also something they would be in charge of.

Although some students complain about not wanting to do community service, it would be helpful to everyone in the long run. Most students do not want to do community service because they just think it is another chore to do. However I think that after the students began there community service that they would realize they were making a difference, and helping somebody else out. A lot of children do not realize the bad things that happen around them, when it is not directly to them. For example Hurricane Katrina was a terrible disaster that left behind a big mess. If students were to help clean up places like that they would understand that community service is very much needed.

Also most of the students that do not want to have to do community service are for their own selfish reasons. They do not want to waste time on it when they could be doing something else. But they do not realize the help they could give to other children who are less fortunate than they are. Community service should be required from all students at our school. It has so many advantages to it. Students would gain a lot of knowledge from having to indulge in this experience. Community service would be a valuable thing to get ready everyone get ready for life when they are older. That is why I think community service should be required on our school.

Sincerely,
