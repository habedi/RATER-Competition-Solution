Dear principle,

I understand that you want to raise the standard for playing sports and other activities so that each student involved needs to maintain a B average to participate. I think this is a good idea because it will motivate students to keep their grades up, and still get to do the activities they want. As I am not involved in sports, I'm not sure my opinion will be most valid. However, I do know that, for a fact, some students will not like this new rule.

They may say they feel more pressured, and some parents might even get into the argument, both on the pro and con side.

On the contrary, I personally think it's a good idea to get up, and keep up, students grades. Some will be upset about it, but will thank you later for making sure that they keep up their GPA while still letting them do extra activities.

One obstacle you may or may not have to face when making this decision is the parents of students. Because you don't have every student's background knowledge, you wont know how the families of these students will react. For example, there might be parents of students who want their child to focus on sports, and sports only. That might be kind of hard to do when they are staying up until midnight to complete assignments to maintain their B average. Several families will get upset at this.

However, A school meeting could be held with the parents and families who both agree and disagree. I think it's a good idea to start this rule that will apply to most, but I think some exceptions can be made for other select students in other personal situations.

That doesn't mean that for those select few, they can goof off and still participate in sports and activities, it just means that for some of them, maintaining the traditional C average may be best.

8th grade student,
