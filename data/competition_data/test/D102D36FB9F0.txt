I agree with this new cell phone policy. I think that it will stop students from using cell phone during class. I think it will also help will help important school events and news spread quicker. Students like freedom I say do the phone policy but keep it under strict rules.

Rules are very important in any situation, it just matters on how you use them. Using phones in schools is a big distraction, but that's only if the phones are used in class. If you allow students to have phones in school you should let them have phones only during lunch and recess. During these two periods there is no real reason to not have phones, most kids just sit around anyway why not let them talk to their out side friends? At this school during recess we mostly play football or basketball. I under stand why you might not want the phones during recess, because people might stop playing, but we do have two recesses, so just let us use phones during one of them.

This school also has dances, movies nights, fund raisers, etc. During recess right after getting out of class is the perfect time for us to start spreading the news, while it is on our minds. Also good with giving short notice information to our parents. There has been several time were a missed basketball games because I couldn't reach my mom. Having more access to a phone would eliminate that.

Having phones during recess or lunch wouldn't hurt, if anything it will help. I say give it a try and if it doesn't work out that's ok.
