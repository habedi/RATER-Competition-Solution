Dear Principal,

Some students think they should do the right thing and be helpful to our community by doing community service. Although, there are some that have a different view of doing so. the ones that think we shouldn't say it's a waste of time or they don't have time at all to do community service. I think we should do community service because it is helpful to our community, colleges look at those kind of things, and last it will give people better thoughts of what kind of person you might be.

One reason i think we should be required to do community service is because it would help our community. If we done things little like pick up trash on the roads or at the parks it would make our town look clean and less trashy. If all the students in the middle school helped do something in our community, it would help by saving the adults time too. There are so many of us that we could be done in no time as if it were only a dozen people it could take a whole year to get what needed to be done finished. I'm sure our community would really like it if we helped.

When you do community service, it's wrote down and colleges are able to see that.

Most colleges would like to have someone willing to sacrifice their own time to help out. When they see that you have done community service, they might be more eager to consider you at their college. Colleges can be hard to get into and that means you need to do all that you can extra to help you out. You never know when a college is looking at things as little as community service for you a scholarship.

My final reason why I think we should do community service is because people are going to judge you no matter what and if you did a little community service it would make them think you are a good person. If you needed to find a job and you went to a store that the owner saw you doing community work, he might say, "Hey, this person isn't lazy i think I'll hire them."

No one wants to be seen as a lazy person and when you're doing things for the community people will see you as a helpful and kind person. Adults look at how you act and what you do to see what kind of kid you are and community service would give them an impression that you're and ok kid. That could mean they would consider their child being friends with you.

Community service can be hard. You have to manage your time, that makes you responsible. Being responsible is something you need to be able to do.

I really think we should be required to do community service.

Yours truly,
