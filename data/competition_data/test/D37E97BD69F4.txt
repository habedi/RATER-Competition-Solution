Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I truly agree with your idea to change the school policy of not allowing students with a C Average or lower to participate in sports. I think that this would greatly improve our schools grades because many of the students whom enjoy playing sports but have low grades will be encouraged and determined to bring their grades up so they can play. Also, they would use the same stamina they had for sports and put it towards their grades, and once they pull that grade up from a C or D to a B or an A they'll see how easy it was to get a good grade, that they'll just keep up the hard work. Which would in the end not only raise their average, but the school's as well, because we as students represent the school, and having a school full of jock's that don't have good grades, doesn't reflect well on the school as a whole.

Also, I believe that being allowed to play sports is a reward. I think students should earn the right to play on the schools sport teams, because then that way they'll learn what it feels like to earn something that they truly care for. Having the students earn the right to play on the sports team is also very important because not only would they learn how to value it, because many people take for granted what they have. They'll also learn how the real world is because you don't always get everything handed to you in a silver platter.

Another thing would be that it wouldn't be considered fair to other students how have A' s and B' s to be working very hard to maintain their grades, while students with C' s, D' s, and F' s without a care in the world are playing sports, and being the MVP, and All-Star player of the school's sports teams. And players who have smarts, and are good at playing always have a better advantage, because those are the students that get picked to play on big college teams.

The students also need to learn that there should be a balance of both academics, and sports, because you might be really good at sports but that isn't going to get you very far. You need to have a proper and good education if you want to make it big, because not all football players become famous, and if they do, it usually doesn't last too long. This is gravely important because many students now a days don't care about academic success, they think that by becoming a professional baseball player, or football player, that their life will be perfect, and that's why they stop trying in school, and by changing the policy more students will become more encouraged, and improve their grades.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
