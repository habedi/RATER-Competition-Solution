School is a place that educates individuals and allows them to grow as a person through knowledge provided by teachers. Teachers are more knowledgeable others who follow a certain rule set to get students to graduate to the next level of knowledge. These teachers mainly know better than students and help students grow as people guiding them to a better life. Teachers know more than the students about life through their experiences, so the students should listen and do what their teachers tell them to do such as a project over summer break. The Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers can correctly guide their students to be ready for their next level of education through their knowledge and experiences through college training for their own profession.

The Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they are correctly guiding them, so they are ready for the next level of education. Teachers are people who like to help others and put the students on the correct path, so they can lead a good life with knowledge. Teachers genuinely are also nice people who mean no harm to anyone because their career choice deals with helping students everyday, so they will not lead their students on bad paths. Instead, the teachers will make sure the students are prepared for most things that will come at them in life and even if the students don't like the Summer projects in the end the teachers were looking out for them. Due to the teachers kind nature of helping others they will keep their students on the right path through the Summer projects that allow the students to retain the information they learned in the year.

Teachers are trained and educated in college to bestow knowledge on students and normal people who don't have the type of knowledge they do. Throughout the school year the teachers are becoming more familiar with their students adapting to the best type of learning they can to educate their students. By the end of the year the teachers are more familiar with the student's learning style, so they can set them up with a project that will help them retain the knowledge to be prepared for next year. Through their experiences the teachers know what is best for the students they are teaching, so it is more within reason for the teachers to design the projects.

Some may say that the student designed projects would be better, but this is incorrect because students are known to be lazy during the Summer. The students would design a project that does not benefit them in their education because they want to be free and do whatever they want to do during the Summer. The teachers on the other hand would prepare them with good intellectual projects that help the students retain the knowledge. So, it is in everyone's best interest that the teachers design the projects to help the students.

Teachers are kind, valuable, and educated individuals who are here to help their students succeed in life and their school career. Through their knowledge and experiences in college teachers can correctly guide their students to be successful individuals that flourish in the world around them by retaining knowledge throughout their school years. Whether it seems like it or not in the student's eyes the Summer projects designed by teachers are there to help them succeed.
