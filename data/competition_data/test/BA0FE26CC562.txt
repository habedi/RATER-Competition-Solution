Most people might get sea sick, But I tell anyone who will listen that it is worth it. Being a sea cowboy is an amazing exspereance. There are many reason to be one such as not be put in the war, sight seeing, and sports with other people on board. Also you get payed watch and feed animals which is not that bad.

When I was on the boat was saeled to Greece. By the I turned 18 which ment that I would be drafted. Sence I was a sea cowboy I was told to continue me work on board. This is only the lest exieting part of my jurny.

On my trip I saw many different monumaets and struckchers. For example the Acropolis in Greece. I also saw the parts of Italy and china. Seeing places like the Panama Canal is one plasure of being a sea cowboy, but what would I do on the waters.

On the waters I played games. Even with the boat rocking we played games like table-tennis tournaments. We also played other games such as fenceing, boxing, and baseball in some of the empty holds. If you are not a sports person the you could also read.

Over all being a sea cowboy is a great job with may plasures of game, sightseeing, and no war. Even though it might be hard and tiering work it is worth the try.
