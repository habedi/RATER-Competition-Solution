lastly a good work ethic can be achieved by participating in extracurricular activities. these activities can have extra work to do at home, like forms or worksheets. this might feel overwhelming at first but if you have a good work ethic, you can finish all your homework and work from extracurricular activities in no time. a good work ethic can help you feel comfortable with your work load even if it looks like a lotÂ to do. you can also accomplish more work in less time if you have a strong work ethic, making it easier to finish school and go to collage. in conclusion, having a good work ethic can make your life run Smith and easy.
