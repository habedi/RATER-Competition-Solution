There are a lot of advantages of limiting car usage. Yes a lot of people use cars to get around, but there are other ways to get around. Limiting car usage would probably cause a lot of complaints, but I think once people started limiting how much they drove everyday, they wouldn't see the need as much.

In Paris, for example, they have banned driving due to smog. The story "Paris bans driving due to smog", Robert Duffer states that "Congestion was down 60 percent in the captial of France, after five-days of the smog." Only five days of banning drivers brought the smog rate down 60 percent, that's huge. To make it easier for the people of Paris to get around, they had public transit free of charge for those five days. If driving was banned for a while people woould find other ways to get around, and other people in the community would help them, like the transit bus giving free rides those five days.

Some people may argue that it's a free country and we shouldn't be limited to how much we're allowed to drive our cars. Yes it's a free country but limiting car usage is actually getting people to be active, instead of being lazy and driving everywhere you go. The United States has the highest percentage of obesity. With limiting how much you can use your car it will make people walk places, if they really have to go somewhere. Also riding a bike, or even riding a bus or train. However, unlike your own car, to get to the bus stop or train station, it will take some walking, which is good.

Also another advantage of limiting car usage would be all the things that would be fixed around our community. With people walking more, the community and city people would want to make our area look better while we walk. In the story "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" Andrew Selsky states, "..Pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." With less driving and more walking to get to places, the community would fix our sidewalks and make more shopping centers and resraurants closer.

Limiting car usage will be hard to adjust to at first, but I think in the long run it's a win-win. It helps us get active and lower our stress from driving, and it helps our environment.
