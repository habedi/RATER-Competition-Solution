If you was a student at Generic_School what would you say teacher or student designed ? There are those who argue that teachers should design the projects over the summer but this is not true. There is an ongoing debate about weather or not teachers should design summer projects during the break. Although some may disagree, I believe that students should design the projects over the summer. Because, we can make up are own projects, its a good way to keep us remembering things over the summer, and if we could make are own projects up the easier the better.

First, we can make are own projects up without someone telling us that we are doing something incorrect. Or they dont like the way that we are doing the project . An they want us to do it how they want it and they want it how they prefer it to look . Its better for me to think of something that wont give me a hard time to do. I wont be stressed out about it because my teacher didn't explain to me what to do specifically. These are some reason why students should design there own summer project.

secondly, If we make are own project up its easier and its better because its me making up my own project. Teachers might try to give us an project on a subject that i might be struggling in or having a hard time with. But its also, good practice for sols and other things like tests an it will also guide you through the summer. It wont be asÂ challenging as it would have been if the teachers would have designed projects for the summer. An if we dont complete this over the summer it would reflect on us. Because we where told we could come up with are own type of project long it was a school related and a subject.

Although some may disagree, I believe that students should be allowed to design there own projects during the summer. An i have many reasons and examples to support why students should be allowed to design there own projects. I also have my reasons why teacher should not be allowed to design are projects for us in during the break. There are some that argue that students should be allowed to design there project this is true.
