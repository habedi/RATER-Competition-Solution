Dear principal,

As we all know you are reconsidering the schools cell phone policy.

The policy's that you are thinking of are A. Allow students to use cell phones during free times and lunch periods, and B. No cell phones at school at all.

I think that you should choose policy A.

I think you should choose policy A for 3 reasons.

The first reason you should choose policy A is communication.

Communication is my first reason because some students need to arrange plans that take place after school with their parents or other adults.

some students may need to do this because they could be staying after school and need to arrange a ride with a parent or adult as soon as possible.

Communication is also my first reason because if a student needs something for class they can ask their parent to drop it off during free time or lunch.

This is why communication is my first reason.

My second reason is long term projects.

long term projects is my second reason because now most students have phones that are advanced enough that they can hold files that are important to a project that can be edited on the phone.

Another reason I choose long term projects is because most phones now have e-mail and during free time or lunch you can e-mail a partner new information about the project to your partner if they are sick so they can still do their part of the project.

This is why long term projects is my second reason.

The third reason I choose is schedules.

This is my third reason because most cell phones can create schedules and planners and when a student gets a free time or lunch, they can plan out their week and plan when homework is due and when to start projects.

Another reason I choose this is because some students might lose their agenda book and have to move it on to their phone.

please take my reasons into consideration
