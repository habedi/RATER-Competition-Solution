TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that the students taking community service is a good thing. I also believe it shouldn't be required to take community service. I think that because community service is for volunteer workers and students shouldn't have to do something against their will. On the upside of the topic I believe it would help the students learn how they can help the community.

For example, a student who doesn't like the community service might try and mess up the environment that their working in just because they don't like what they are required to do. It would also have an effect on peer pressures because the kids who do like the community service could get pressured to be a nuisance just like the kids who don't like the service. The children who do like the community service could get bullied because they actually enjoy the schools new program. Most children might have to many extra curricular activities to complete there hours of service.

This is why I think that community service should be optional for the students who want to do it. For the students who wouldn't like to participate in this activity they should have an alternative. The alternative should be somewhat like community service so it is equal with work that the other students are doing. The people doing community service wont stop because the think the alternative for the other students is easy.
