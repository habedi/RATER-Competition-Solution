I think

I argee with this active because some people don't like to do things they just like to chill out and sit around and we need more people do things like year book singing then just having less people do more work and it hard having less people do all the work in days because not everyone likes do things by them self.

Since there are not a lot a people around to do the yearbook singing we need more to acutally parttacipate in other actives so the can pass the grade and move on so the fail the resouce that they are in becaus if you fail that resouce then you can't move on to the next they won't let you until you pass the resouce.

And the reason why would have more people because we dont have that many people to do things around here in the school because you only have few people doing jobs around here an we need more people do help out the job that people are giving like cleaning the cafeteria and do more putting pictures in the year books.

Because there is no way that everything can be done by two or three people. we need help because everything that people have done to this school is awsome we just need more people to do more things than having less people do all the work and it takes forever to get the actives done. I think we should just have more people partrticpate in the actives that are being the principal have giving us instead of having less people doing all the work. I think that would be a good idea to have more people joing in on the actives. then just having less people partcipate in the actives that are giving. this why i argee with this idea.
