Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I understand that you expect a lot out of students at

SCHOOL_NAME and want them to do they best, and just because your our principal and care a lot about us, you will do whatever it takes for us to achieve. But doing work all the time can be tiring. I think if you have a C or higher on your report card, you should be able to do sports. As long as your student are passing they should be able to have fun and play sports. Not only is sports fun, it helps us with exercising and staying in shape. If students play sports and work out, they will work they brain and other body parts. Playing sports means a lot to us hear at your school because we can come together and work as a team.

Sports shows us new things like getting your anger out in a good way, feeling good about yourself, teamwork, and etc. I really hope you will let people with a C average play sports because we try our BEST here, and as long as we are giving you 110% , you should let us play sports and enjoy our selves !

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
