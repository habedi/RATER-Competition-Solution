Have you ever had to do a project over the summer for school. Well some schools have it as a requirement to do a project over the summer break. The project that is assigned by the school should be teacher designed. This is because when the students comeback to school there teachers design the projects that are given. Teachers know the specifc steps the students need to use to make sure they have the right information they need to get a good grade, and what information they are required to have on their projects. Also the teacher can design it around something the students do on a daily bases on summer break.

First reason the teachers should design it because they design all the projects when the students comeback to school from summer break. I say this because the teachers are always making the plans, and creating the way the projects are done. This is shown when they give you a project they create those plans and requirements. It also shows where you can find the information about the subject that the project is on. The biggest thing about the teachers designing the project is that it is involved in what you are learning in the class that you have the project in.

The second reason on why the teachers should design the projects is they know what information the students need to have on their projects. Also what specifc ways they can get the information without violating the rules of the projects. This is because students have access to all type information through the internet and other sources, but some sources are not correct. Websites on the internet are a prime example of getting false information, which could lead to getting a horrible grade on the project that is assigned. Also the teachers know the websites that are vaild because they go in and look through them carefully.

Finally the teachers can design the project around something the students do everyday on summer break. This is because they know studnets on summer break are not going to do reading or writing a paper. So they just make it something easy like recored the weather for a two whole weeks. They also could make you track how long you sleep a day for a whole week.

That is why teachers should design the summer break project. It is because they are going to have to make the projects when the sutudents comeback.Â
