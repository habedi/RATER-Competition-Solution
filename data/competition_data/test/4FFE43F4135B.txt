Dear Principal,

I think both policies are phenomenal but, I most likely agree with policy number 1.

I agree with policy number 1 because I think students do have a right to have some time on the phone, but only on their free periods. Hence, what if something happen at home or something happens to any of your family members and your mom or dad calls you? This will count as an emergency call because, you have been called to get a dreadful news. What if something bad happened to you and you have to call your guardian saying that you have to go home because you don't feel good? Anything can happen in the moment you don't expect it. These can be some reasons to why

I think you should bring phones to school.

This are some reasons to why you could bring phones to school, just as long you have them turn off during class time. Only on lunch periods or free times you could use your phones because, you might want to spend some free period on your phone. I agree that you should turn your phones off during class because, that might be a distraction for you and your classmates, but on free periods or lunch time you might as well use your phone. With this statement that I'm trying to state, I wish you understand me, and I hope you would let us bring our phones to school just as long we have them turn off during class time, but turned on during lunch period or free time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
