Online classes are not as reliable as classes taken in school; Students might cheat, they will not have anybody to give hands on experience, might not have internet or computer access, may develop lack of communication skills around their peers, and poor organization skills. Online classes are not the way to go with our education system.

Students cheating is a big problem with online classes. Students feel that because they are not being watched, they can use the internet to find their answers or get answers from students who have taken the course before. A friend of mine was kicked from her online classes because she turned in a paper that belonged to a student who took the course 2 years prior. The only reason why they found out that the paper was not hers was because she forgot to change the name on the paper to her name, prior to that she had been cheating on all of her worksheets, test, and quizzes and was about to finish the course with an A. Another problem with online school is students not being able to have someone there to show them how to properly do it. I took Geometry at school and I am currently enrolled in Geometry online, Geometry online is more difficult because you can not raise your hand and have the teacher come over and explain the problem to you.

I once had a question about the material that we were learning, but I could not ask my teacher until the next day because she was offline. By the time she was back online, which was at 2pm, I had forgotten what I specifically wanted to ask her. This is a problem because students are not able to ask their teacher for help until the teacher is online, resulting in students forgetting what they wanted to ask or students eventually cheating. Students not being able to have access to a teacher while doing worksheets, test, quizzes, etc..., should not be encouraged in the learning system and should be thoroughly thought through.

The biggest problem with online classes are that some students might not have access to a computer or the internet. Less fortunate students are always left out of the conversation when it comes to online classes. An example of this would be students with financial problems, not all students are able to buy a computer that runs smoothly enough for them to be able to attend video conferencing and hold files of digital papers. Less fortunate students may feel left out because they are not able to take online classes due to their financial status. Another issue with online school is the lack of basic communication skills students may suffer with. Students not being able to physically talk to their peers may result in them not knowing how to talk to people their age. For example, Twitter, I had a friend who had lots of friends on Twitter. Her and the Twitter friend wanted to meet up before the concert of their favorite band, they met at a coffee shop across from the arena, but things were very awkward. They did not know how to communicate with each other without the use of Twitter, because that incident was so awkward for them, they never spoke to each other in real life or on Twitter ever again. Talking to people behind a screen is so much easier than talking to them face to face because, you do not have to show the real you. You can show a distorted version of yourself, which is never good for the learning process.

Poor internet is one of the reasons why online classes are not reliable. If a student can not finish a test because their internet went down, then they risk getting a bad grade because of something that was not their fault. Students should not be penalized because of an issue with their computer or internet, students would not have to worry about this issue if they were taking their classes in school instead of online. Some students may find it difficult to take these courses, especially if it keeps happening. Another concern with online schools are students having poor organization skills because of the lack of physical papers. Students will not have to organize physical papers, which is good but, they will also not know how to properly keep up with things if they are not digital. This can impact their lives greatly, especially if they have a job in the future that requires heavy organization skills. Students should be taught from an early age how to organize, but if they are not taught, they will not learn.

Some may claim that online classes can help students with physical disabilities get the same amount of education as students who do not. This is false because those students can have a teacher come to their house, also students with physical disabilities need to have some sort of physical contact with their teacher in order to fully understand what is going on in the classroom. Online are not efficient for students with physical disabilities because they might not be able to reach the computer and their family might not have the financial stability to own a computer.

To conclude, online classes are not as reliable as classes taken in school; Students might cheat, they will not have anybody to give hands on experience, might not have internet or computer access, may develop lack of communication skills around their peers, and poor organization skills. The online education system is not as efficient as classes in school. Online classes are not the way to go with our education system.
