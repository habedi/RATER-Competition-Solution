Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Changing the school policy to have a B average to play a sport will be very hard for many kids because most of them are at a C average . Yes school should come before sports but kids need to be active and join in and be apart of our school. Many kids come to junior high thinking yes we finally get to do sports and support our school but wont be able to because there grades are a C average or lower and wont be able to participate. Some kids that have B averages wont be the kind of person to do sports they focus on there school work so when try outs come there will be less people trying out and make our school not strong in our sports area. I would be sad if it got changed to a B average because i wouldn't be able to do cheer because some classes are harder than others and by failing one test it drops your grade, and well you get kicked off the team. So i am saying it wouldn't be a good idea to change the policy on many different levels because it could change a lot of students mind sets on there carriers and more.
