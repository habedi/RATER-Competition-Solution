Truthfully i don't really think this kind of technology would actually work. A persons emotions are determined by that person only. A computer no matter how many upgrades it has could never fully understand a persons emotions or even how they feel for that matter. A person can have many facial exprecions. They can show many feelings from happiness to saddness,from frustration to anger. If you look hard enough you can tell how someone is feeling by looking at their face but you don't need a computer to do it for you. Yes some computers are advanced enough to be able to tell how a person is feeling but they can never actually know what emotion they have. Sometimes faciale expercions can be unpredictable but if you pay attention you will be able to tell how someone is truly feeling. It mostly takes more then technology to tell how a person is feeling. It takes a real person with real eye's to really see. If somehow the kind of technology that can be able to tell how a person is feeling through facial expresions was developed then that would be impressive. However no matter how advanced the tech could be i believe that only real people posses the real ability to tell how a person could feel. That is how i feel about the facial expression examining technology being developed.
