Certain schools are able to have ÃÂ¨distance learningÃÂ¨ by using a video chat. Students who are not physically in class will be at a disadvantage because it would not be the same environment , and students would not be mentally present. Students would not be learning anything if they are on a video chat. I strongly believe students will not benefit from distance learning.

For example , If a student is not in a learning environment , then the student will not learn. A learning environment is very important. When students learn through a video chat , this only lets them see and hear. The video chat does not allow them to feel and interact with other students. Which would not be beneficial to students.

Secondly , students who video chat would not be mentally present. At home students have way more distractions at home than in school. Examples would be phones, household pets, TV, etc. With all these distractions students would be off task and not paying attention.

Some people may argue that if students stayed home and use video chat , it would actually benefit them. Some students can learn better in their own environment. In some cases, these counterarguments would be true. Some students can also focus better at home if removed from all distractions. These would be beneficial to students who use video chat.

All in all , I strongly believe students who use video chat will not benefit from it. Students will not be in a learning environment , and not be mentally present. Students are not meant learning from a video chat , students should physically be in class.
