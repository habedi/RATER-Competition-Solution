The challenge of exploring Venus showed a great amount of evidence to support both opinions, supportive of the idea or not. As we lnow venus is 170 degrees on the surface but ships can take it. Then theres the fact that no spacecrafts sent by humans has ever lasted more than a few hours on the surface of venus.

there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets on venus, and even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmospher.

Venus distance wise is a time consuming yet possible feet. Venus and mars are the closest neighboring plants to us and Venus more than mars shows there could have been life long ago on this planet. Venus consists of valleys, mountian ranges, craters , and many believe oceans once inhabited this planet. Talks of NASA doing a human ran investigation thirty miles aboves venus to do reaserch.

NASA belives that Venus has not easy condistions but survivable for humans. There has been talks of even sending people down there to do research in the future and that could go bad knowing the knowledge you have on this planet. the challenges would be very intimidating and unpredictable.

In the end these talks on further exploring Venus is very intresting and inthink is should be done at the right place and the right time. Us as humans are curious creatures and should have all the knowledge we can gather on these forigne planets before human exploration. A lot of questions un answered and a lot to answer.
