Summer is a time to relax and enjoy a break from the various amounts of school work and learning done throughout the school year. Students often forget the curriculum by not being in school, so schools brought the idea of summer projects. Summer projects are a great way to bring in learning outside of school and still be able to have fun either with friends or oneself. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, it will enable students to follow a proper guideline,it will helps students transition into future careers that require projects,and it will give students more time to enjoy summer.

However,others may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial because students will be able to demonstrate more creativity. According to a variety of students,by being able to design the summer projects, students will want to actually complete this mandatory task and not get bored doing it. Students do not want to be given a lot of work,so by letting them choose their project it will help them take an easier route as to what they would want to do .Although this could be true,but there is not enough evidence to support this claim. Therefore, students would be better of completing a teacher-designed project.

To begin,teacher based projects will provide students with a proper guideline to fulfill this requirement. Students can often become confused with what they are being told to do and usually do not bother asking. This leads to going off task and the student is affected by this obstacle. By having a guideline it will help keep students on task by checking off what they have completed. This will also provide directions that can be simply followed with a detailed explanation as to what they need to do. Students can be more focused on the task and not give them too much of a hassle to deal with. Guidelines will ensure students are doing given projects correctly and acquire a good grade expected from each individual. Students usually do not perform well when they are not given any directions and are just told to do it. It gives students an advantage to abuse this and complete however they would like because they were not told exactly what to do. A proper guideline will give these students an ability to follow each step and have similar outcomes when comparing work with other students. Guidelines are a way to obtain a good grade at the beginning of the year and give students satisfaction and want to participate more in school. It will create a postive enviorment to all students.

Secondly,students can transition easier into future careers they choose by doing teacher-designed projects. In the work environment many companies and other businesses require projects in order to make sure that their business is doing well and to keep up to date with information in order to inform other employees. Teacher-designed projects will help students prepare to tackle any given project by designing them to be specific and goal-based. This will give students an opportunity to gain skills and many insights that can be helpful when writing a resume and provide more open doors when looking for a job. It is also a great way to challenge themselves and be able to expect whatever comes their way. Students usually do not expect a lot in school because they are not given hard of a task because it is simplified down for learning purposes. This gives them the idea that it will be the same when having a job,which is not the case. Students need to acknowledge that there are different expectations to completing projects. The skills they gain in high school or college will be very important. By doing teacher based projects students will not regret what they have learned since it will benefit them greatly later on.

Finally,students will be able to enjoy more of their summer. Students do not like having to do summer work because it is a time where they finally can relax after being in school for 9 months. Summer break is 6 months less than that. Ensuring teacher-designed projects,students would not have to think of an idea for a project. Students get stress by doing a lot of work and that could harm them when it comes to their education. Teacher projects will give students less stress than they need. With this teachers can easily grade them faster and be less of a stress to them as well. In this case it is a win-win situation. Students want as much time they can before having to go back to school in August. Projects created by the teachers will give students a quicker opportunity to finish instead of having to create a project that can take time away from their relaxation. Students would then not mind a project in the summer and will help them stay up to date with their education.

In the end students would be better of with a teacher-designed project because it is more beneficial to them in their future careers, relaxation time, and following directions. This will helps students grow into a better version of them self and let them be able to help others when doing a project. The argument above shall support this reason and should be taken to account when given out summer work to students.
