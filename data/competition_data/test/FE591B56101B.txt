Dear Principal,

As you walk down the street you see trash, bottles and cups. Think how nice it would be if all of the students at our school had to do community service. I think community service should be required at our school. This would help everyone in the community. It would clean our parks and roads, help students and would teach students it isn't good to be lazy. I think it would be very smart to require students to do community service.

A normal day for a student is to come home from school and play video games. You could change that and have the students do something productive like cleaning roads and parks or helping fellow students by tutoring them. This wouldn't only help the students who are getting tutored or the parks and roads it would help the tutors and the cleaners they would be helping others by doing a very simple task.

If you didn't require this the students would become lazier than they all ready are and would sit and play video games all day!

On the contrary the students would be outside with their friends getting fresh air. This would help them stay in shape.

I know many students wouldn't like this but, if you made them work for 1 hour after school once a week or, 4 hours a month it would really contribute to citizens of our town and city. Think about how many people would love to walk and jog on the paths of our clean parks

I think requiring community service would assist everyone. Please consider this reasonable and fruitful idea.

From, your students at SCHOOL_NAME
