I disagree with this policy because, this would require many more teachers to run clubs, many students would not find any interesting clubs and lastly many students might not have the time. There are many other minuses to this policy, like it would ruin the point of extracurricular activities, they're called extra curricular for a reason. Also, to force so many students to go after school, might be too much, Generic_School, having a little over 1000 thousand students, might be able to accommodate for so much after school, and not all teachers want to host clubs, while some clubs could take on a dozen students many others cannot. So, this policy would waste students and teachers time because, it would ruin the value of the extracurricular, force students that dont have the time to do clubs and extend school time past what it should and needs to be.

To elaborate on why it would ruin the value of extracurricular activities, forcing them to maybe go to the student council or any other club, would ruin the fun of said things, students, most likely might go to a club and sit on their phones. Doing nothing to expand their knowledge, or what this policy is suppose to accomplish, at most it would just waste a lot of peoples time. Extracurricular activities are out of the curriclum, forcing students would accomplish nothing. Some extracurricular activities are not educational, in any way, there is no way to force people to have fun.

To accommodate 500 students in Generic_School is a easy job at school time, but the problem is that not all teachers want to host clubs, and not all clubs/activities have space for so much students than normal. I would say, on average each of the clubs could hold around 20 people, and the current number of clubs is around 10, so 20*10 is 200, and that is about 1/5 of the school, which is definitely not enough to hold 400 students per day. With 3 days to hold clubs after school, it is impossible to expect a perfect 1/3 split between the days. Another point is that, currently, the students have all the clubs they want, because of that, no more clubs would be made with any interest, forcing people to do something will make them do it, but not passionately, like clubs should be ran.

This would waste student and teacher time because, with the two previous reasons, also adding students just doing nothing in said clubs, would make this issue much bigger. There would be clubs that do nothing that would make this policy valuable, also how would they track what students are there, that would also waste time, extracurricular activities are called called extracurricular for the simple reason that they are extra.

To conclude, this policy would waste the time of both staff and students because, it is hard to track whos actually going to clubs, it ruins the value of extracurricular activities, it is hard to accommodate for the extra students. Some extra reasons are, how would this policy be implemented, many teachers might disagree with this policy, and lastly, many students would not have the time.
