You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! We get to do so many things and have fun. This is also a great way to help out communities and people in need. If the trip gets boring, just do something entertaining to pass the time. Most importantly, it would be the time of your life.

The Seagoing Cowboys get to look around at the places we stop and go sightseeing. Even though we have to take care of the animals and clean their stalls, it gives you a chance to feel good about what you are doing. On the trips back home they entertain themselves by playing games, reading, playing table-tennis tournaments, and boxing. On one trip I even got to see the Acropolis in Greece!

In conclusion, Joining the Seagoing Cowboys would be a great experiance for anyone. It also gives people the chance to really pitch in and help out anybody in need or a city that needs supplies to live off of. If you are thinking about joining the Cowboys, you should because they would be glad to have some more helping hands.
