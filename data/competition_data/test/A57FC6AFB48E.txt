Dear Mr principal I have a few ideas for you. First of all you should have kids help the community. It helps in many ways, First it could help the enviorment second it keeps things clean. Children should participate so our school looks clean and prideful. Helping people out is not a waste of time. Think of all the good it would do for all that live around us. In any way possible it would help stop the risk of disease too! Maybe if everyone took pride in there school you might even help prevent pollution. If you encouraged everyone to work you could show how nice the community could be cleaned. Also you could give extra credit or something to provoke kids to help our great country. people have to learn how to clean up after themselves. people need to know what would happen if the world didn't clean up after themselves just imagine it. The world would be a giant ball of garbage! Do you see the consequenses of just a little garbage could do to the Envierment! that is why I am asking you this Go GREEN!
