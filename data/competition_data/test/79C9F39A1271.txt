Venus is a very pretty panet-that looks like a star from Earth-that lights up the night sky. Even though it is often referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus has proven itself to be dangerous to explore, but very worth it. Despite its proximity to us, obsurd heat and pressure condidtions, spacecraft landing failures, and high levels of corrosive sulfuric acid make studying Venus very challenging.

Although it is very dangerous to enter these extreame conditions, NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has came up with a theory to avoid Venus's 800 degree Fahrenheit temperatures. They suggest that Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray-only reaching 170 degrees Fahrenheit-about 30 or so miles above the landscape. This would make the air pressure close to that of sea level on Earth. Still, these would not be ideal conditions, but survivable for those with deisre.

Another fear of scientists is spacecraft failures. Humans have sent multiple spacecrafts to land on Venus-each unmanned-but have all failed within a couple hours of landing. Although those previous missions have toutched down on Venus, none have made contact in three decades. This is very discouraging for scientists, but also motivating in some aspects.

The most crutial danger of landing on Venus is the insanely high levels of corrosive sulfuric acid. These clouds make it impossible to survive through Venus's atmosphere. This atmosphere contains almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets coating the planet. This makes it unreaistic to have human life on Venus.

The insane pressure and heat, spacecraft fails, and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere make studying Venus very challenging for scientists. Scientists believe that dangers and doubt should not limit the edges of immagination and innovation so, they are striving to meet Venus and its challenges.
