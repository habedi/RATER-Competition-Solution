Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that it should be at least a B grade average to participate in sports because when you try to get into college they will not except C average. Plus if the student really wanted to play sports they get a B average. And that would be better for us in the future when we are trying to get into college. Don't in college they look at your grade from the past years to see if you qualify for what ever college you are trying to get into.

A B grade average is not really hard to get if we pay attention and do all of our homework and assignments. And in high school the coaches for the sports teams want students to get at least a 3.5 grade average so if students get use to having a b grade average then when they get in to high school they will already know what they have to do if they want to plat sports. There are probably students who already have B grade averages so it won't make a difference to them.

If most you know that most kids have a C grade average and you want to change the policy then all the students that have below a B grade average should have to attend a after school program. There they get help with there homework and do make-up work until there grade gets up but if they don't even try to get there grade raised then they should get kicked off any activity that they do unless they get there grade up.
