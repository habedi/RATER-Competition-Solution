The idea of projects over the summer should be controlled by the student body as it will allow a deeper engagement and that it would encourage a student's work habits. Students will gain a greater knowledge through student-designed projects because they are likely to pick projects that is in their interests. Doing projects of interest will not only provide students to be engaging, but can actually be fun to the student body. Although teacher-designed projects can ensure students will get a learning out of projects, student-designed can allow students to pick projects of interest which allows more engagement and can be a fun activity to look forward to during the summer.

Summer projects that are student-designed allows students to choose projects of interests which causes them to be more engaging. Allowing students the opportunityÂ to pick their own project causes students to be more interactive as they are completing a project that interests them. A majority students that get projects during the school year don't get any benefit from the experience because they are not given an assignment that is enjoyable. If students were to be given an assignment that is not enjoyable, they won't be committed to put in a lot of effort when completing the project. Also, students that don't put in effort toward the project are less likely to even get a full learning experience which defies the point of learning during the break. Not only will students be more committed to do projects, but they can also get an actual educational experience throughout the summer. The idea of having teacher-designed projects is basically having summer school, while student-designed projects can allow students to be more free and outgoing.

In addition to making students more engaged, student-designed projects can be considered to be a fun activity to do during the summer. Having student-designed projects during the summer can be thought of as a fun hobby to most students because the projects can literally be about anything they can imagine. Student-designed projects can allow a student to have a creative and critical mindset which allows a more fun experience than having teacher-designed projects that can be strict and overwhelming. There is moments during teacher-designed projects that can cause a student to be frustrated because the teacher has full control of the task to complete. However, there are some setbacks to having student-designed, such as student projects that are not even considered to be educational. With students having the power to do whatever they want on a project, students will sometimes have the urge to do easy assignment due their is no kind of limit of what they have to accomplish. At least with teacher-designed projects there is a criteria that a student must meet in order for them to complete the project, and with a student having the complete control of the criteria they might not get any benefits.

In conclusion, having student-designed projects over the summer will exceed a greater learning experience than teacher-designed. The intended goal of having summer projects was to continue a student's learning during their break and having student-designed projects will be the best option for a student's learning. Student-designed projects can make students think outside the box and can bring out the creative mind of a student. This will allow a far better option for the students as it can be fun and educational. Even though teacher-designed projects may ensure students will get a learning experience, student-design will make students more interactive and enjoy the task of projects.
