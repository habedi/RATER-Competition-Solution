Other students want to make a little bit of money by doing small jobs like baby sitting, mowing the lawn etc.

Some students may not find the after school activities entertaining. students may not like any of the after school sports or because they probably are all ready involved in a sports traveling team. Some students just dont want to do anything their inactive or "lazy".
