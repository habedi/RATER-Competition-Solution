The position of the principal is good because some people in schools just wake up go to school and go home right after that, but with this decision this way the students can interact with other people and learn about different things going on in the world and can give them a chance to try something new. This decision will help with creating friendships with different people but also will be able to make some student get out of their comfort zone and interact with people. Some people may not have liked this decision because maybe they go home and hang out with their neighbor but they go to a different school and that school didnt want that disition so they are bored have nobody to play with.

Its a good decision because it gets people out of their houses and more than just the average day of school. It help with that by getting people to stay after school and gives them a chance to hand out with their friends or to make new friends. It also just plain lets them have fun with a club. Getting to get out of the house also can also help if your parents are always just nagging you to get out of the house and do something this way you can go to a creative club for almost any subject like SGA, art club,strategy games club,video games club, or even stay after for a sport. you have so many disitions to choose from all you need to do is get out of your comfort zone and try something new.

Another great thing about the principals disition is that it gives everyone something new to do and to get you out of your comfort zone. This some what helps people get out of their comfort zone and do something with their lives. It also helps with someone who doesnt have the time to go to a sport after school this helps. It would definitely help with my family because my little brother has his own sports after school so if I stay after school then I can pick him up and not have to wait bored at home for another two hours just to get him. If you are trying to make some new friends but still hang out with your friends then you can just get a teeacher and some of your friends and create your own club so that other people if they are fasinated by your club then they can join your club.

With the principals desision I still think that with it that the school will be able to know their students and try to get them to get out of their homes and also get them to try something new. By this desision the students will be more well rounded and be able to do someting that they love to do. They will also be able to hang out with their school friends and not have to worry about trying to get home from each others houses where at the school they have buses to get home.Â
