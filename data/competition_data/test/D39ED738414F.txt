Dear Principal,

I think that you should let students bring phones to school and use them during free times. One of the most important reasons why students should be able to bring their phones to school is if they miss their bus and they have to contact a parent or guardian. Or if they are involved in any after school activities like sports or clubs they would have to contact someone to get them when what ever they are doing is over. They are also great to have if there was ever an emergency. A good reason for letting them use their phones during free periods is they could find where their friend is and sit together. Or they could ask each other homework questions and help each other. Those are just some of the many reasons why students should be aloud to have their cell phones with them.

sincerely, a concerned student
