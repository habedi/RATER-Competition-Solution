cellphones and driving

Cellphones and driving has a lot to do with each other in this day and age because so many drivers feel the need to text and drive or to be on their phones in general. The fact that so many car accidents come from texting and driving yet people still do it is sickening. A lot of people have died from other people's mistakes yet people still do it on an everyday basis which is very crazy to think about.

I strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concerns to people health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving. It states that the person that is at fault for a car accident caused by cell phone use or ticketed for talking on the phone while driving, their insurance premium is very likely to rise especially if their cause.

People think they can drive good enough to have a conversation on the phone and still pay attention to everything else going on the road. In all reality no one on the planet is that good a driver to pay attention to everything going on around them and watch out for people while still texting or scrolling social media apps. Thank you for listening to what i had to say about cellphones and driving vehicles.
