This is a completely wrong, and unjust demandment that's given to the students. Students have their own lives to deal with, and some of them have it more difficult than others. It's not fair how schools are forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities, when they don't know what's going on in a students life. These students should have a choice, of whether, or not they want to participate in these activities.

Students already have enough stress as it is, whether it's from school, home, or maybe even their job that they need to support their families. Some students have to take care of sick family members, or they're dealing with their own personal problems, and therefore cannot participate. Schools can not make it a "must" for everyone because some familiesÂ do not want their child to participate in extracurricular activities.

Students may want to participate but can't because of their own personal reasons, and that can lower their self esteem. As schools give out more than needed homework to students, them must having to participate could effect their grades. It would also effect their mental, and physical health to be forced to participate in these extracurricular activities.

Schools don't know what's going on in a students life, therefore it's not fair that they are forcing them to participate in extracurricular activities. Schools need to give the students the freedom to choose what they wish to do with their free time, and not force them to. In conclusion this rule is very wrong, unjust and should not exist.
