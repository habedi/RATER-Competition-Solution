Everybody has it. It goes with you wherever you are. In your car, when you go out to eat, even when you go to the bathroom. Yes, that's right, a cell phone. The modern convenience that kids today claim that they couldn't live without. Would you prefer this to be allowed in your school?

My response would have to be no. Cell phone's are a distraction to everyone. They cause you not to focus on the task at hand. Yes, it's convenient to have one whenever you need someone to pick you up, or you have an important question, but other than that it's pointless. Who cares what App's it has? Or if it has a calculator? Isn't that what we're supposed to use our brains for?

And also, kids would find a way to sneak behind policy 1. They would try to bring it in the classroom and use it while You (The principal) aren't paying attention. They could cheat off of tests, text their friends the answers, the whole agenda.

Kids today always try to find ways around the rules, and this is the time where you're supposed to be hard on us so we can appreciate what we have. So it rounds us, the students, into a better person so that we don't take what we have for granted.

Plus, we need to teach today's generation that it is possible to live and breathe without texting every two minutes, or calling someone for hours. There are more important things in life besides knowing everything your friend is doing every second of the day. Like an actual education, your grades, or better yet, talking face to face!

Kids need to learn how to interact with other kids through actually getting to know them and meet them. The best part about conversations is trying to figure out their facial expressions, when they furrow their brows you know they're confused, or when they roll their eyes, you can tell that they think something is ridiculous. But over the phone, or texting? You have absolutely no idea. So, I'm sorry for having to decline your generous offer in Policy 1, but I prefer to actually get to know people, face to face.
