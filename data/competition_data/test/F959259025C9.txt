Today many people are on their phone & driving at the same time. Cell phone use while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries have been occurred from accidents caused by texting and driving. In my opinion, driving without phone use will decrease the percent of crashes around the world. Phone use is one of the reasons of car crashes occurring.

Answering a text takes at least 5 seconds of your attention away. That can be enough time for you to collide into another car or a car colliding into you. Even answering a call could take most of your distraction away from you seeing where you are driving. It would be safer to use the cell phone when you come to a complete stop or when you have reached your destination.

94% of teens that drive acknowledge the danger there can be by texting and driving, but 35% admit to doing it anyway. Teens are a big percent more likely than adults to get into a car crash or almost crashing into another car or anything that is in your path due to talking or texting on the cell phone. Also the amount of teen passengers doubles the risk of car crashes, because they are young & they like to use cell phones. They are even more of a distraction with all of the hype & noises.

263 teens (age 15 to 19) were killed as a result of distracted driving in 2016. The rate has increased throughout the years. If you can wait until you come into a complete stop or if you can wait until you reach your destination, please do so, because it will decrease the risk of crashes around the world.
