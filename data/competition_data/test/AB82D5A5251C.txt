Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, some of the staticstics show that "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city;uneven, pitter sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut off traffic; and new restutants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up". This is an example of how progresive this change has made on cities. Also metioned in Selsky article " Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution".

Paris had a huge smog and to help clean it up and to prevent from getting worse, Paris made a law that only certain number license plates could drive on certain days and if you drove on the wrong day than you would be fined.

"The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog".Â  Alot of the people like to participate in this event.

Many people did not like the limitations, but learned to like them considering the end result of a healthier enviroment. These two advantages of limiting car usuage is just a couple of the many.
