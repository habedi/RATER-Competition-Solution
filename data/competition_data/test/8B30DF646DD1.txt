Lots of people in the world use vehicles in their daily lives but do they know what they are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Thats one of the reasons why limiting car usage would be so great for us. Another great advantage we would have by limiting car usage would be lowering stress and lowering air polution as well,"said Carlos Arturo Plaza." Also limiting car usage would make cities denser, and better for walking, those are the advantages of limiting car usage.

First off, limiting car usage would reduce greenhouse gases. Our cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent in car areas in the United States. That is an unbelievable percentage of greenhouse gases in Europe and an unreal percentage here in the United States. Lowering that percent would be great and alot of people would be thankful, and that would be an advantage of limiting car usage around the world.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be lowering stress and at the same time lowering pollution. If you limit car usage and just stop driving a car, grab your bike and go for a nice bike ride, it would be a good thing if you are stressed out, it will take your mind off of things and allow you to ease the stress and just relax, and while your not even thinking about it, you wouldn't be polluting the air because your on a bicycle. That is another great advantage towards limiting car usage.

Also limiting car usage would make cities denser, and allow more walking room for people to walk around instead of having to dodge vehicles. If we limit car usage, we could probably build and make more parks where people could walk and exercise, but if we have alot of vehicles driving around, how could we do that. So therefore, limiting car usage would allow us to do that and there's another advantage of vehicles being limited.

Now do you understand how limiting car usage has its advantages? Here i'll let you know again. One it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by alot. Two it can even lower stress as well as when your not even thinking about it, lowering pollution. Not driving a car and lets just say you go for a nice bike ride, that will lower your stress, it takes your mind off of things and allows you to relax, and at the same time your lowering pollution. And finally, it will makes cities denser and allow more walking room for people. Those are the advantages of limiting car usage.    Â
