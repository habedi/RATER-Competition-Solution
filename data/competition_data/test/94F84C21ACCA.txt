Eight hour school days start to become a repetitive process for a lot of people. Kids get told to go out and live while they're young, but school takes up a majority of their time. A lot of students dont want to go to school because they dont want the social interaction, or they dont enjoy it. School is important in life and they should give an alternative option for students. Students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home because they can become more independent and responsible, it gives students a chance to learn differently, and it gives kids an opportunity make a flexible schedule that will suit their needs.

Being independent and responsible is important for life. When students go to school, they learn the basics like English, History, Math, and Science. While those are important, some students might not learn how to become independent and they will rely on others. Working from home or doing online school teaches them that they need to be responsible and work by themselves. It covers aspects in life where they are able to teach themselves, and they can use that down the road later in life because someone might not always be there to help them.

Teachers teach in many different ways like students learn in many different ways. When teachers arent meeting the criteria for student, that can make school extremely hard and miserable. Sometimes all it takes for a student to understand what they are learning is getting extra help, but other times that isnt enough. Giving students the opportunity of working from home can give them more flexibility on how they learn. Students will have the ability to figure out what works best for them and then be able to use that and become successful in school.

Students go to school on average 40 hours a week, but there are some weeks when students put in the time and they dont feel like they learned anything. School can be draining especially if its not moving at the speed the student will be successful at. When that happens some students feel like they could have been doing something more productive with their time like spending it with family and friends, or working towards a goal that they want to meet. Having the ability to work from home gives students the chance to work at their own pace and they can have a more flexible schedule so they can succeed in a lot more areas of their life that dont include school.

Attending school is nothing if students arent succeeding in it. Giving students an alternative option of getting an education is important. While every student is not the same it is important that there are ways to try and cover everyone's needs. When students work from home they have the ability to become more independent and responsible, they can learn in ways that will help their needs, and give them the opportunity for a flexible schedule. When giving students the options to attend classes online or at home they now have the ability to figure out what works best for them.
