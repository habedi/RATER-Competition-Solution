The limiting on car usage would be a huge positive on the world and the people. As everyone knows, cars now adays are the key to "Making it around the world". They say cars make your life easier and its good for the economy. Some of those facts are true but at the same time not exaclty.

Automobiles are the "linchpin of suburbs". People can not live without their cars and need them for where ever they need to go ; work,the park,the store. Sooner or later in the future humans might not live at all with the usage of cars. In the article In German Suburbs,Life Goes On Without Cars, it says "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe".  All these fums and such are beimg spread in the air. And in Paris, pollution was a big effect on the peopel. Filing the air with smokes and harmful gases that affect a persons health. Do you want to go outside and have a hard time breathing?- Nope i didnt think so. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after intensifying smog. Diesel fuel was the cause of that only because France favors diesel over gasoline. This decrease in cars will be better for implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

When you buy a car, you need space for it to stay in. A space can cost up to $40,000 max. That is alot of money you could save for other appliances and daily life products. Also with a car you may get fines for speeding or anything in that state. In the article Paris bans driving due to smog Robert Duffer said motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. The less cars the better! why go through all that trouble. As well as less cars means no highway usage meaning more construction for buildings and stores. And think about it! More stores you can shop at and save more money to shop at those stores because you arent buying gas everywhere you go and paying for car innsurance.

Cars are benefitial for alot of things. But for the people and our future,it would be best to cut out cars and make our lives healthier and better. It will become a huge positive on the world.
