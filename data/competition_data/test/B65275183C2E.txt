Dear principles name:

I would like for you to let students play in sports or be included in an activity if there were B, or C students. The reason i say this is because there are a lot of students that would like to be in any kind of sports or would like to be included in any activity, but their grades may not be as good as they usually would have to be. Not just for these reason but for many more. I would understand that you may not like them to participate but there are some stuff that they could think of and their grades would go up.

For example my opinion is that some students or a student may atleast think or say: When i grow up i would like to be an basketball, football, or soccer and for that to happen I have to study really hard and get better grades. So they could study more and get better grades. And if the principle does not agree i would think of some better stuff for the principle to accept for the students to be in a sport.

Another way we could do this is by saying that the kids may have an apportunity to be in sports but if there grades are slipping or if there not doing better they could get kicked out. But i would really try my best to help the students out.
