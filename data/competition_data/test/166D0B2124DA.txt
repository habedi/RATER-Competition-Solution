In the article of the "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author states how sicentist can tell if you're happy, sad, mad. I think we should use this device in classrooms and all around the world. If we used this in classrooms it would make teaching way easier. Wouldn't it be neat if we didn't have to tell people how we feel just think about it. But then again it may turn out bad cause we could lose so many jobs. Cause if we have a robot to see if we are sad or not we wouldn't need to tell people how we feel like counclers or doctors. Now if we did use facs it would help people way more to be honest but then again it may not what if it reads your emotions wrong and get sad mixed up with mad that could go really bad. It could also save expensices with the computer you dont need breaks it will always be there to read your emotions. One way computers could mess up what it dignaoses the wrong medicine to someone for being sad then it could possible kill that person or maybe it will make. But then it again it could prescribe the best medicine to you. In conclusion it would be best if we used computers in classrooms.
