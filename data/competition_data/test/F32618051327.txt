Imagine this, you're a 9th grade freshman in high school and you just moved to Generic_City from Generic_City. All of your old friends at home missing you and since everyone at your new school has their own friends, making new ones is hard. If you were in an extracurricular activity such as a sport, yearbook club, or student council, then maybe making new friends wouldn't be as hard. The principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This is a marvelous idea because it could keep students out of trouble, it would keep them from being on their phone so much, and they could make new friends.

When the school bell rings and all the kids are free to go home, some kids get bored and don't know what to do. Some get so bored they get into mischief such as breaking things and stealing items from stores. If they were required to do an extracurricular activity after school, then they'd get into less trouble because they're engaged in an activity. So instead of stealing that chocolate bar because you're bored and want attention, you could be in yearbook club snapping photos of people for this year's yearbook!

Another reason why extracurricular activities after school is a good idea is because if you're at home after school watching T.V. and playing games on your phone, the next thing you know it's seven o'clock and you still haven't done the five page essay that is due tomorrow! Extracurricular activities will not only keep you out of trouble, but they will also keep you away from your phone. Even though phones do keep us entertained, they can be very distracting and keep us from what we really need to do. If you were in homework club then you would've gotten your 5 page essay done, plus you could've made friends and not gotten distracted.

If you have trouble making friends at school then going to an after school activity would help. There are tons of activities that could help you make friends, especially sports. If you joined a sports team you'd bond together as team plus you'd stay in good, healthy condition. So instead of you laying in your bed wondering how you're going to approach someone tomorrow to say hi to and try to make a new friend, you could just join a sports team, student council, or another club to have fun and make memories.

It is a good idea for students to be in extra curricular activities because it would keep kids doing good things and keep them out of trouble, it would give them a break from their phones, and it would help making new friends. Another reason why this is a good idea is because these activities are a good stress reliever. Instead of stressing about that test you have tomorrow, you could stay after school at homework club and study with kids in your class. So your back to being the person from Generic_City, with an extracurricular activity you're required to do, it will be easy making new friends and adjusting to your new school.
