The face on Mars is just a landform. In America we have land forms of all kinds. We have winter and so do they, so what makes it different except for the location?

It is just a rock formation without an alien monument. Landforms are not rare on other planets. Landforms come in all shapes and sizes so it just so happens to be a face.

When the scientist went back up to take picture and look at it more, they were able to take a clear picture of it. The scientist then blew it up to a bigger picture and saw that it was a natural landform. It states," As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than a pixel size." This comes to show that they will be able to see things closer and see if anything is around them. It also tell us that it actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa, which is landforms that are normal around the American West. It states," It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho." This tell us that it really is not something an alien could of done because it is a natural landform just like America has.

All of this evidence comes to show that it is just a landform that was created naturally. Mars landforms look like ours and is like ours. We have landforms that are different and so does Mars so it was just a coincedence that it just so happened to be a face. Some people think that just because it is a face that was created by Aliens because it looks to much like a face, but landforms come in all shapes and sizes. It is just a natural landform.
