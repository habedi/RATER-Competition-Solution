Dear Mrs. Principal,

I believe that we should use the first policy that states that the students can bring phones to school, but should be turned off unless they are currently in lunch or any other free period.

I think this because students need to socialize in between class periods or in their free time, and cell phones really help with that.

Also, many students have parents that are away a lot of the time, and so they rely on their cell phone to talk to them, or when they get home and can't find the key, they can simply call their parents instead of breaking into their own home.

I know that students should have their cell phones in school because they need to socialize.

I know this because talking to other people or peers can really remove a lot of the stress that students feel during their school time, because school does actually put a lot of stress on students.

As a student, I have encountered the school stress firsthand, and if you ask anybody, they will tell you the same thing that I am telling you: When you talk to someone, you feel better about your current predicament.

Another factor why you should let students have their phones during school is that students may need to call someone that isn't in their school, such as a parent or a sibling.

I know this because many students aren't what you would consider to be "angels," and so some students get after school detention, and so they must contact their parents or guardians beforehand so that the parent or guardian can take time out of their schedule to get you once your detention is done, before they make plans and then ruin them by getting you.

Then your parents will be disappointed in you even more than they would if you had just gotten a detention without ruining their plans, which just adds onto the school stress that all students endure, just requiring more cell phone usage.

A last reason why you, as our principal, should choose the first policy is because, with the economy as it is, many students have parents that work past the time when their children get home from their school.

If the child forgets where the lock is or something like that, they can simply call their parents for directions to where it is, but if they don't they must endure a few hours outside of their home, hoping that their parent will be home from work soon, just to have their perfect, peaceful day ruined by you, causing your stress levels to go up once more.

I have experienced a scenario similar to this firsthand, and I know the type of stress that you endure because of not having a cell phone in your pocket to call your mom or dad.

What happened was I came hoe from school in the middle of a small snowstorm, and I found that the locks on my doors had all frozen shut.

Frustrated, I kept tugging at the lock until the key I was trying to place in the keyhole irregularly bent in a different way than it should have, costing my family money.

Instead of going to a nearby friends house as I should have, I walked three miles with my backpack to where my sister worked.

She then had to disappoint her boss by taking me home and getting me inside my warm, comfy house.

On the car ride home, however, I was getting yelled at by my sister, only adding to my bursting stress levels already.

Clearly, Mrs. Principal, it is a better choice to have cell phones allowed in school for the following reasons: Students need to socialize to relieve stress, students need to call family members for help, and to simply enjoy the use of the cell phone so that when you start up with your class work again, you are ready for a new subject and ready to learn.

Also, it can't hurt, because they don't use them during class time.

Mrs. Principal, you should choose policy one.
