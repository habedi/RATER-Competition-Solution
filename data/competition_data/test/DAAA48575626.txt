Online School

Better or worse?

Offering distance learning is very beneficial towards students, it offers more freedom, the environment is less stressful, and students would not have to wake up early to arrive at school. In an online class a student would have more freedom towards their assignments. Students could finish their work in a much faster and productive pace without any in class distractions. Teachers would also benefit from this as they would be able send the worksheets via email without printing all of them off for a in school class. Students would also be able to make a schedule that works for them. This would allow them to put their most important classes in the order that would help their work the most.

In an online class, the environment would be much less stressful. The students would not feel obligated to "fit in" with their peers through clothes, hair, and reputation. These examples cause many students stress that may lead to influencing the level of work they do. In an online course, the students would not have that stressful environment holding them back from achieving their fullest potential. This less stressful environment would help teachers with losing their students work. In an online class everything is in a folder or an email so it would be much easier to find an assignment that was not turned in.

Students would not have to wake up as early for online class vs in school. Many students(especially High School) suffer from the annoyance of waking up early. Everyday kids have to wake up at 5:30 AM just to go to school. At 5:30 AM many students are going to be half dead and just plain exaughsted. In online school, students would have the option to wake up later and attend the same class but just virtual. This would help students with their work and overall attitude during the day. For example, Many students play sports and some have practices that end at 10:00 pm, these students have to go home and get ready to sleep, which many teenagers struggle with especially after a practice. Most of these students will not be able to sleep until about 11:30 PM because their brain hasn't settled down yet. This would only give a student 6 hours of sleep before they need to wake up for school. 6 hours is 2 hours less than the average sleep that a teenager needs. Through online school, many teenagers could wake up and get started at 8:30 AM with a much healthier lifestyle. Overall, Online would help students with school far better than a regular public school. Every school should offer this choice if a student would like a better work environment. Online school helps Students reach their fullest potential.
