Humans must continue to study Venus as it is know to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. With NASA stating that it is possible to send humans to Venus, we must do it to gather information on how Venus use to be like Earth and then how it became impossible to live on. The author uses logos to inform the reader on how to get a human to Venus. If a human were to go to venus he/she would stay about thirty miles above the surface where it is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure is normal and solar power would be very useful. With these conditions it is possible to send a human to Venus.

Although Venus can be accessed by humans, the information scientist really want is on the surface. Sending a human to the surface is death but, scientist are working on a machine made of silicon carbide. The silicon carbide material can withstand the awful conditions of Venus for about 3 weeks. 3 weeks is enough time to gather rocks, dust, gas, and other objects on the surface. All of this information that the author says is building a compeling reason to study Venus.

The author does a great job pursuading the reader into wanting to explore Venus. He/she uses the rhetorical strategy pathos when he/she said that Venus is the most Earth-like planet and that the misson is survivable for humans. That gets the reader wanting to see how it all ended for Venus and also, makes the reader feel excited in wanting to learn more. The author also states strategys to the process of exploring Venus which gives the reader hope that it can happen.
