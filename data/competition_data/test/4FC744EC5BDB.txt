Have you ever looked a photo of someone and wonder how they feel? Yes well now you can Thomas Huang form the neckman institute for Advance Science at the University of Amsterdam. Im all for this Facial Action Coding Sytem. It could show us how people long before use felt when getting there picture painted of picture taken. people could know how family member and friends felt before they past away. what if we could know how animals felt with the FACS?

We dont know how people felt back then, we didn't know what they were going through, but with the FACS we could get a general idea of how they felt at that time in there life. Say you had a family member that passed away that you never met before but you want to know if they were a happy, sad, or mad person you could use the FACS to know so you dont have to hear it from someone else. Wouldnt it be cool to know what animals are feeling? If this FACS could show us how humans felt wouldnt you like to konw what your pets are feeling if your pet was sad and you didnt know,but you use the FACS you would know and then you and do something with your pet to keep the happy. Now you might be asking how does this FACS work well ehrn the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. examples your frontalis pars lateralis muscles when you raise your eyebrows you are suprised, your orbicular oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. these reasons i just listed are why i support the FACS!
