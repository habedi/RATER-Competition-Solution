Being a seagoing cowboy is oppertonity of a lofe time. Read my three reasons why you should be a seagoing cowbaoy.

You can help people in need. Like giving them food taking them to medical attetion if needed. Plus helping people is the greatest feeling in the world. Like even the little stuff like helpin an elder walk across the street picking someones books up. Just help people in need every day.

You get to see and meet new people every day. Becomig friends with someone is the most wonderful thing. Helping some one in need then becoming there friend is great. You can learn new cultures in making friends. Just be nice to friend and people you don't know.

You get to see expirence new things. You can see things you proably never heard of. You can see the been in chicago. You could see one of the temples in greece. Just go out there and do somthing diffiernt.

Being a seagoing cowboy is just a different thing to do. If you like helping people this for you. If like going out and making new friends then be a seagoing cowboy. If you like seeing new things and adventure you would be pefect. So it is now your dission to be a sea going cowboy if you like to do all these things this is for you.
