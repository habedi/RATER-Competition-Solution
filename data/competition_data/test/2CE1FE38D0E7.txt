Phones and Driving

Driving is a good way to get whatever you need to go in a shorter period of time than on foot. Americans like driving from places such as fast food restaurants to appointments or work. As technology advances and people like to accommodate themselves with technology, we also want this same technology with us even in our vehicles. However if someone is driving with a device I think it is dangerous and can cause serious injuries. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it can be a distraction to not only you but others, can cause a car accident, and it can be illegal . If you are not convinced then I'll explain why driving while on your phone is dangerous.

While driving anywhere you need to always focus on who and what is in your nearby surroundings. In fact, according to driving test.org, ¨ texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving under the influence of alcohol¨ . Since the light refracted off the phone is what you are focused on, vehicles or objects approaching would not get your attention. This is especially true when the phone emits a light with a brighter color or image.

Also best case scenario if you do not cause an accident you may even miss your turn or exit all because you were distracted. Worst case scenario you may cause an accident which I will explain next.

Driving while you are on your phone is not only dangerous because it can be distracting but what happens can lead to a car accident. If you do not take the time to focus on the road, your carelessness may harm pedestrians or other drivers. DrivingTest.org says twenty Texting and Driving makes you 23% more likely to be involved in an accident¨ . It then goes on to say that in 2011, 1.3 million automobiles accidents were caused by this and one can only assume that the numbers have gotten higher with technology advancing. A later text mentions that in 2015

¨3,477 people were killed and 391,000 injured¨ in crashes relating to texting while driving. This can even be illegal are result in murder.

Driving while on your phone can be illegal .If my other two arguments have not you proven that on the phone while driving then hopefully this argument will. Driving while holding your phone is illegal in my state of residence of Georgia. It is illegal under ¨the part of a sweeping hands-free law¨ according to www.usatoday.com `Even though driving with your phone may not be illgeal in your state as stated above it can possibly result in murder. ¨Texting while driving can lead to a homicide charge ¨says pittsburgcriminalattorney.com. The site says you get charged with this if you happen to cause the death of a person due to ¨recklessness¨ or ¨gross negligence¨.

Therefore due to your recklessness of not putting away your phone while behind wheels you can face heavy charges when it could have been prevented.

In conclusion driving with a phone present is a sure way to distract someone and possibly an accident. If that is not convincing then the accident can lead to the death of passengers or other drivers. This will result in heavy charges if deemed responsible for death. Therefore save everyone the trouble by simply putting your device away until you reach your destination or parking real quick. Concluding my argument why drivers should not be able to use a cellphone in any capacity is supported by not my words but professionals as well.
