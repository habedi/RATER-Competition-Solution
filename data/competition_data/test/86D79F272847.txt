In discussions about whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed, one must first define the two terms. On the one hand, student-designed projects are defined as projects designed by the students. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects are defined as projects designed by the teachers. Although summer projects that are student-designed can be beneficial to the students, the advantages of teacher-designed projects outweigh the advantages of student-designed projects. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

Student-designed projects can be beneficial to the students, but the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. An advantage of student-designed projects is that the student will be more creative with their project, because it is designed by themselves. Therefore, students are more likely to complete the assignment. A disadvantage of student-designed projects is that the student will take advantage of the student-designed project and make it easier for themselves. The students will not challenge themselves, which will cause them to work less when they could be working harder. Consequently, the students will not learn over the summer. For example, if I was given a project over the summer that is student-designed I will most likely make it is easier for myself. Since it is summer break I would not want to do any type of difficult school work. Another disadvantage is that the students may not design a project that has to do with what they are supposed to be learning about. The students could easily go off topic. For example, if I were to be doing a summer project that is student-designed about history, which I should be learning about during summer break, I could easily go off topic and turn the history project into a science project. Therefore, summer projects should not be student-designed projects.

Teacher-designed projects are very beneficial to the students. The advantages of teacher-designed projects outweigh the disadvantages. An advantage of teacher-designed projects is that the teacher will challenge the students which will cause the students to work harder. The students will actually learn from the teacher-designed project since it is designed by the teacher. Another advantage of teacher-designed projects are that the teachers will design the right work for the students. The students will not go off topic since the teacher already has instructions for the students. A disadvantage of teacher designed-projects could be that students would probably not complete the assignment possibly because it could be difficult for the students to complete. The teachers may possibly make it difficult so the students could challenge themselves which is a good thing. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

In conclusion, the advantages of teacher-designed projects outweigh the advantages of student-designed projects. Schools should require students to complete projects that are teacher-designed so that it will assure that the students will continue to learn during their long summer break.
