In the story the author says it's the brightist planet in space. And every space craft has been a failer that has landed. On it and they have acid clouds and your head can expload. And it's super super hot hoter than the sun even and they have very big storms and lightnign stikes. Even though it's very similer to Earth it's still very diffrent in meany ways. Even not being on the planet and just chillin above it you can still die but its hard to even study it. From above because how dens the planet it. But they are finding ways to go their but it's still very hard to study the planet.

I think the way the author puts it is good they talk about how it looks like Earth like it have reveains rocks lakes and more. But they also explain how bad the condions are their. So even though i dont really care about space that much I think it would be cool. Because for all we know Venus could of had life on it at some point in life so their could be bones of some kind or if their still is life that would be very cool thats my conclusion.
