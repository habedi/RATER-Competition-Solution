Some people say that the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. Others say it shows traces of civilzation on Mars in the past. There are many statements in the article that show evidence that the "face" is a landform, and not an actual face. I think it is a natural landform. Others say differently than I do.

There is plenty of evidence proving the "face" is a natural landform. The text states that the picture is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte or mesa is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin says, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in thr Snake River Plain of Idaho." The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa the same height as the "Face on Mars." This evidence proves that the "Face on Mars" is just a natural landform.

As you can see, there is planty of evidence proving that the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. After seeing this evidence, I still believe that the "face" is a natural landform. Others may still feel different, even after seeing this evidence. All we can hope is that NASA eventually figures out if it is a natural landform, or a face.
