Do you think it is a natural landform or a face? It is obvisouly a natural lanform! Mars has a lot going on, people wondering if there can be life on Mars or not, and now this.

First, how could there ever be life on another planet? Mars does not even have enough water for human life. In the passege "Unmasking the Face on Mars", it states, "The caption noted a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth" The reson why the rock formation looks like a face could be from rocks being inside the sand to formate the face and the rocks could have shrunken or have gone away.

Now, this face is a land form, it just looks like a face. This can happen anywhere in the world, not just on Mars. In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars it says, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural land form. There was no alien monument after all." This proves that the picture that was taken may looked like a face but was in fact, a landform, and thd cause of this face can be from anything out in the environment.

In conculsion, the "Face of Mars" is not a face, its alnd form, no faces can still be dented in a land form for that long. The cause of making this face can be from rocks, or any other thing on Mars.
