If your principal was to make a rule saying that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity how would you feel about that? I would feel like I was being forced to do something that I may not want to do. By making students participate in at lest one extracurricular activity could bring so much impact whether its good or bad and I think its mostly bad.

For example, a big problem is money, schools might not have enough money to support and make all these activity so they would have to cut school field trips, and other fun things that the students look forward to doing. Another problem is that parents might not have enough money to go out and buy the things needed for that activity let alone the things they need for themselves to eat, drink, and sleep under a roof at night, or maybe if the school says they will have it how would they get the money. Would we even have enough money to go on trips if we needed to, say we win matches, games and go to a competition to see who is the world winner we wouldn't have enough money for that so we wouldnt be able to go.

Therefore brings me into another problem time, we would have to plan to go to those competitions and matches, games for that activity, and the students might not even be able to go to the extracurricular activities because they already signed up for one after school they wouldnt be able to make both everyday unless they quit one, or try to switch schedules if they could but if they couldnt, the students would have to quit the one that there doing outside of school they dont get a choice to pick witch one to quit because the principal said the students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. If students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity on top of the one their doing outside of school when would they have time to do homework, study for tests, hang out with friends and family they wouldnt be able to on weekend because they would be busy with that activity and on weekends they would rather have fun and hang out with friends than do homework I know I would.

Meanwhile, stress is a big and rising problem, students already stress enough with all the homework and tests that they have to do so by adding in work things onto their plate in going to lead to more stress and more failing grades do to stress and not being able to get work done in time. Stress is one problem a lot of people deal with and normally its mostly from school and by having a rule that all students most participate in at least one extracurricular activity your going to see a lot of students breakdown form stress.

Although having a rule that says that you must participate in at least one extracurricular activity could bring more people to be fir if its a sport or if its just like a debate club, chess club, or over all something like that it allows students to take a break from all the work they are doing, and instead of making it a thing you must be in you could say its optional and students would mostly likely be willing to join these activities.

Therefore, having this rule buy saying students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity should not be allowed because it overall isnt going to be useful or helpful buy creating more problems.
