Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I think that students should not be aloud to bring there cell phone to school, because you know as well as everyone else that there is going to be some one that doesn't turn there phone off. If you allow students to bring a cell phone to school then they might use it on a test. For example, a student has a big math test coming up that he/she did not study for. So that student could very easily bring his phone to class and use the calculator on it. They could also text there friend and ask them for the answer. If you do allow students to bring there phone to school the teacher should take up everyone one phones during class and if a student were to sneak it in the teacher should write him up or give then ISS.

If students were allowed to bring there phone to school they may have dirty pictures and show them to people. A student could also use his or her phone during school to threaten so body then they may not want to come to school. bringing cell phones to school would just make it easier for girls to spread rumors or gossip about someone. Another thing is what if a student doesn't have a cell phone then that student will fill left out and sad. this is why i think cell phones should not be aloud in school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
