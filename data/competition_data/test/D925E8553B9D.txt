I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This the modern way of studying in the majority of the world, so that can give more chance to all students who don't have time to be in school everyday. That would by very easy way for all special students who are disable or sick.

Every student has a different life from another, so at this time most students are working and studying at the same time. The online classes are benefit all students who dont have the time to be in school on time, work far of the schools' building, and has family. For example, in my school their are around thirty girls are marred , and have family or kid need to take care of. I knew some of them are using the online studying program with some classes, so they make their work way better than other who are missing their classes at lees once a week. in addition this would be helpful to all students planing to go to the College, For 60% of the College and University classes and exams should be taking online.

Also,the most benefit's people are the disable people. That will be the biggest gift in the life to have their education like every kid. They would study with other kids from home and share their life with them, so that will be so useful to make our kids, sister, and brothers are equal with other students and get the knowledge and skills from their schools' life. Moreover, that will take off a lot of expenses for the counties and families they spend on the private schools, so that is become a great benefit to the society. That will benefit all families, to keep their work, in staid of driving their kids for to long time twice in the day. Also, we the students are going to have the opportunity to make up the classes or take them from home, when we sick , late or have no way to be in school. I think this what will be the most common study way in the next ten year later.

Some ideas and people think that is not the right way to study or be educate, because they think most of student will use this to not be in school and being out of the school weather of teaching. With all my respect to all people and ideas rejected the online study' program, and in polite way, that online program for the kids who were not graduated from all schools level, from Elementary to High school, cannot take these online classes with out showing up their acceptable purpose and family agreement, so that how would schools be control the way of education for students.

These were some of to many benefits of the online studying and some of the good affection to the students' life and education. We should be use all the technology, that we have to make our life easier, but we need to control every device and plan the right way to our kids to use it with.

In short, The online study option is one of the modern useful way to learn and benefit idea for all the students and the society.
