It's been a large debate on if the Face in Mars is a natural landform. I believe the Face in Mars is a natural landform from natural disasters happening on Mars. One thing that leads me to believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform is when it says in paragraph 7 "Thosands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."

So, proof was also given that the mysterious Face on Mars was a natural landform. In paragraph 11 it states that objects were found in the picture such as airplains, Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks. This leads me to believe that all the objects are also causes of this natural landform on Mars because objects like these may leave marks, or spots and ect. Lastly, what led me to believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landfrom is paragrapgh 12 saying "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." This says that the Face is way to large to be a human face or alien. in conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because there was proof that it is, objects were found on the picture making spots, marks and ect., and that the face is way to big to be a human's face or alien's.
