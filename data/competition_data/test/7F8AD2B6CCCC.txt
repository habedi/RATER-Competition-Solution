The idea that summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Should be student-designed cause for the whole school year teachers have assigned papers and projects that they think is a good idea which some of them are, but some of them are confusing and hard to some students.

As a student I feel as if we should come up with our own project, especially that some students want to be teachers one day get a head start on how to come up with a project for their students for the future. For example students may use their teachers project that they assigned them and put a twist on it something that is fun to work on,but teachers and some students think that it should be teacher-designed cause some students have a mindset and think teachers have been giving out projects all year why stop now. Which is a lazy mindset students should want to make their own project. One student might just go as far and say why can't it be both and the teachers and the students come up with a project and combine it which is great but as students get told to do these assignments and projects from their teacher and they are specific projects with a rubric there isnt much a student can do but go by what they are told from the rubric, no brainstorm ideas just get an A and go by the rubric. It should be student-designed cause students have their own ideas and what they can do to make a project better and look appealing you get a project from a teacher and a rubric and you are going off not what you think but the rubric what the teacher wants so every student is doing that, thats why all projects look the same and have the same idea and concept. Teachers argue that it should be teacher-designed because the students are going to do something thats not important like video games or sports not about academics and that is a valid argument, however how do they know what the students are going to do that if they don't get to make their own project. Teachers may say because it is the summer students won't do the project cause there have been assignments where they are given over the weekend and the students still won't do them so if they give the students a project over the summer they will defiantly not get it done which is false that project will be 60% of your grade for the new school year who doesn't want to start out with a perfect grade at the beginning of the year? some students will forget over the summer yes but when the school year is about to begin send an email to a parent or on the remind app so when the students do come back they are ready to present. I would like to see what students come up with and how they would present it students should be able to do summer projects with their rubric that they came up with and doing these student-designed projects will help them with a career and a job where they need to brainstorm and think of their own ideas instead of getting the exact directions handed to them. It also takes the stress off the teacher in thinking of a summer project, before the end of the year a student-designed project would be good and would benefit the students greatly.
