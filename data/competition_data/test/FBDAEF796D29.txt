Don't you think that some students wont find the activities interesting? what if the students dont have time for an activity and participation due to the work load from school? Dont you think students would get injuries from the sports provided? In general, most people stress enough with other things out of school. So I think students should not be required to participate. Because not all students have time for an activity due to tight schedule, some students will not be able to balance a extracurricular activity with school work, and the activities that are available like sports can cause injuries.

Most students already have tight schedules, and take advanced classes that challenge them already. Home work and projects stress students causing them to take a lot of time and effort to raise there grades. What I am saying is, the work load from school already keep students busy. Not everyone will have time to practice for a sport competition, or have the time to plan school events as student council.

Time after school is valuable to students. How? students like to enjoy there hobbies like drawing, playing games, hanging out with there friends etc. Replacing that time with extracurricular activities would only stress the students more causing them to tire themselves. Family time is important to students too, but that time is limited because school takes mostly take half of the time in a day. About an average time of 7 hours school takes up in one day, so say like a student wakes up at 7:00 AM and school starts at 8:30 AM. School would end at 3:25 PM and the remaining time would be left would be about 6 hours for a student to do chores, finish homework, eat dinner and lunch with the following of other responsibilities.

Doing an activity would mean balancing time and responsibilities at home with homework too. For some students it wouldn't be a problem but for others it might be. Not everyone is capable at managing time so as multitasking. Everyone is different but everyone has there own time and schedule knowing fitting in other activities is hard to do. Example, say like you do a sport which would be like volleyball and you sprained your wrist on your dominate hand. Your dominant hand is used for writing in school. That would mean you will have to take more time completing other assignment's due to the injury. Injuries will interfere with your everyday life because of the time the injury takes to heal. It can also permanently affect your health which causes your time management to shift permanently too.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities impact students lives more then you think. Not everyone has enough time or have the ability to balance an extra activity and responsibilities out of school. In the end its mostly the students choice to join an activity or not. Cause you don't know everyone life out of school or the hardships that they are going through that are preventing them to participate.
