In the making of mona lisa they had cpmputers tthey was using to create it. They haad a emotion calculater to caculate the emotions. Mona lisa was 83 percent happy, 9percent disgusted, 6 percent fearmful and 2 percent angry. The ideaof the emotion coculater was made by drpaul eckman. Dr. Paul decided to name the idea FACS which stanmds for facial actions coding system.

It al began constructsa 3-D computer model of the face, all the forty-four must work like human muscles. Dr. Paul had classified six basic groups emotions happieness,suprise,anger,digust fear and sadness. in my opinion i think that this is a great invention.

Human preform the same impressions every day trough emotions. We tell our friends jow we feel or by the expression on our faces they can tell how we feel. sometimes its hard to understand or figure out how people feel. some hide there emotions better than otheres than there are more who show it eaiser.

The Mona lisa is a demontration is really intended to bring a smile to peoples faces, it also shows how muvh a computer can do. Some ad will make you happy then their are some that will make you frown. I honesthly think that tis is a really amazing idea and think that alot or people would enjoy it.
