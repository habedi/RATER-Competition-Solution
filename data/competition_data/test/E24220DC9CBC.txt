The principal should let kids in school have at lease a B average because if it was lower then they should not participate in school sports until they get that grade up. Another reason is because they should let kids have that average is because is not bad, they should at lease be A' s and B' s. i also think that a c average is good because is no that low but they should at least put i t up. For example if someone wants to play in soccer and they have A' s and B' s and they have only one C they should tell him/her to put it up and then she could get in soccer. The principal should let us do activities in school is because not all the students are going to have at lease b average. Kids in our school should have fun that's what sports is about. Then for example let say all most all the kids participating in a sport and they have at lease a c average then they wont be able to participate in activities unless they put that grade up. Another reason is maybe is there last year and they want to participate maybe with their friends and they cant because they don't have they average they are supposed to have. Does it really matter what their average is. My last reason is they should let us participate in school activities and sports because maybe they didn't had a chance last year because of their grades and now they are trying to put it up this year or at least give them a chance and let them participate in school sports and activities. These are my reasons why the principal should let kids in our school participate in school activities and sports.
