Having Phones at School

Most people would like to have cell phones on there free time but some wouldn't.

I think that having cell phones at school would be good but just not in class.

If we had cell phones in class then no one would learn anything because they would be texting instead of listing.

If no one listened then no one would get a good education and not a good job.

Maybe some people from different schools cant have a cell phone and you text them and they get caught trying to text or even texting.

Most people in school might not have a cell phone and wont be able to text in free time or lunch periods.

The people that don't have a phone might feel left out and that might encourage them to get a phone.

Some parents might not let there kids take there phones to school.

If they didn't because they didn't want them to text during school hours then that might make them change there mind about not letting them take it to school.

Most people that don't take there phone to school would not want to and might would just leave it at home where they would not be tempted to text.

Some of the students wouldn't use that freedom to text in free times wisely.

Most people would text in the middle of class and some would get that privilege taken away and never get it back again.

Some people could be out sick and need the homework assignments and would text a friend and ask for them so that they could go ahead and get that done so that he or she wouldn't have that much make up work.

Most people wouldn't want anyone to have that privilege because they might be afraid they would abuse it and not use it correctly.
