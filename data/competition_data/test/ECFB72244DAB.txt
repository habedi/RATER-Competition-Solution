Dear, Principal

I Think The Idea Of Making Students Do Community Service Is Really Good.

But Some Students Don't Have Time For That. You Can Make All Of

Them Do Community Service. Just Ask Them At What Time There Available Like

That All The Students Can Do Community Service Just At Different Times.

And Here's Some More About Why I Think Community Service Is Good For Us Students.

See Community Service Can Keep Us Occupied. Especially The Students Who

Do Drugs And Are Trying To Get Away From It. Also The Kids That Have Problems At

There Homes With There Parents, Guardians, Bothers/ Sisters. While There Doing Community Service They Can Also Think About What They Do Wrong And How They

Can Make It Better. See There's Alot Of Reasons Explaining Why Community Service Is A Good Thing For Students.

So Yeah

Think About That I Think It Can Make Students Do Better In Our Behavior And Stuff Like That. But Don't Let Us Students Do To Much Community Service.

If Not We Wont Be Able To Have Fun.(:

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
