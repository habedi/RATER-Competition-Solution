Do you think that the principal should not allow cell phones at school at all? I think that the principal should not allow cell phones at school at all because, cell phones can be very distracting to yourself and/or others, you can have accidents with them, and you can get them stolen.

Cell phones can be a big distraction to you and/or others because sometimes you can forget to silence your phones or put them on vibrate and they can ring. They can also keep you from studying. You may not even go to class because you know that cell phones are not allowed and you would rather text and call your friends then pass your classes and learn.

One way you can have accidents while on your cellular device is if you are texting while walking you can run in to another student or teacher. Another reason is you can run into a wall or opening door. You might even fall down the stairs. If you do have an accident then you could get in trouble and get your phone token away.

The last reason why the principal should not allow cell phones at school at all is because they might get stolen.
