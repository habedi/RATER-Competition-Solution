I would like to tell you why it is okay to have a grade C average and why its okay to do other thongs.

One way that it's okay to have a C average is because there are some classes that are really difficult or they just don't understand it. One way that I think you should put your grade up is by asking the teacher for some help or just find a friends that could explain how to do the work. Another reason is just simply take notes or pay attention. I know that there are a lot of people that try to distract you just move away or ignore them. Some student just don't do well in school because they think it's cool to have bad grades, but it's not. One reason it's not okay to have bad grade is because next year when you try to play a sport that you like you won't be able to that's why try to do well in school. Another way that you do bad in school is because you have girls that you like or they might like you. One way that you both can do well in school is by helping each other. That's why you are relationship. Other reason why you do poorly in school is because your from other country.

Like me when I first moved from El Salvador I didn't know that much English, but I learned from going to school and pay attention on how they pronounced the words. This year I got to play the sport that I loved because I tried my best and paid attention. I am trying to keep it this way so that next year I could play the sport that I enjoy. You people should do the same so that we have more people playing sports then people out in the streets. I play soccer because I like it and I am good at it. I also play it because we play against other teams and scouts get to see you play. We hope to give the state of Missouri a championship win so that we have money for other sports that people could I enjoy. Like we could do a team of skateboarders and go to different place to skate.

I think if you do sports you will do better in school and have better grades.

I also think that my mom and family members helped me do well in school I think I could do better in school, but as long as I can play sports I think I'm alright

So students do well in school so that we can play sports, and maybe we could win championship so that scouts could watch us play and maybe we could become professional like I hope to do one day.

That's why I think we should all do well in school wouldn't you like to be know as someone who is a good person in schhol.
