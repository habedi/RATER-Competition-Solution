Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe allowing students to bring their phones to school will cause distractions and result in grade point averages dropping. I feel this way because I know from personal experience when a phone goes off in class everyone stops to talk. School is meant to be for learning not socializing with our peers! I also think others will take advantage of the privilege you want to give us. From the past I have seen many students easily text one another the answers and cheat, without the teacher noticing. Many times I have even seen them on Face-book! I know we are all teenagers and just want to be with our friends, however I don't think you should encourage or allow us to bring our phones.

To tell you the truth, I would love to have my phone at school but I feel I wouldn't be able to focus. Checking my phone for a new text message every second and listen to TEACHER_NAME, as he talks about the Holocaust is not an easy task to do. Many students would not know when to turn things in or even then the next test is.

Another point I need to make is that just one text message or picture can ruin someone's reputation. Rumors are always started at school, and I don't think they should be carried on while we are at school. This will just create for work for you in the end. For example, more consolers and punishment will be required. Who said and sent what is not a fun game to pay! Before you know your school will be a jungle!

So why encourage it? For safety? My suggestion is if you put a phone is every teaches room, all the students will have access to it and not need their own phone. If they forgot their lunch just a quick phone call is all that is needed. Thank you for all you time.

Respectfully,

STUDENT_NAME
