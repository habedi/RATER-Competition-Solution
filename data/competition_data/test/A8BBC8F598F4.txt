I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and any other free time because what if there is an emergency or they get kid napped from school, they could just call there parents or 911. They just can have the cell phone off in class so if they are tacking a test or something when it is silent in the classroom, and the student might of forgotten to turn the volume down and it could just ring and possibly mess everyone up.

I don't think the second policy should be a policy because the students at the school need some communication to there parents if needed. If the parents bought there child a cell phone and the child goes to a school where cell phones are not allowed, then that sounds like a waste of money for the parents. The parents might end up taking the child/children out of that school and put them in a different school and then the school where the cell phones are not allowed might not get a good reputation from the parents. The parents might tell all of there friends not to put their child/children in that school.
