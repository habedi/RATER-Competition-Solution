In my opinion , driverless cars shouldn't be a thing . Why? ,because what if the car malfunctions and swerves off the road into oncoming traffic. Electronics and things tend to malfunction alot and Driverless Cars is risking the life of people .

Driverless cars are for the lazy people, they're for people who don't wanna drive they just want to sit back and let the car drive for them. If that was the case they wouldn't have gotten their license to drive. In the future licenses wouldn't be a thing if driverless cars are around , there's no need for one if the car just lets you sit there and watch it drive every where,that's just wasted time to get your permit then wait a few months and then get your license for driving.

Before putting any real driverless cars into the real world they should round alot of tests , because they should want everything perfect no messups or anything because that can be very dangerous if the cars system isn't programmed right or anything . That is a risk to lives of people who decide to buy them
