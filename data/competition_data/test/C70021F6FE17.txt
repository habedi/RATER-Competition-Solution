Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it wouldn't be fair for only people with a B average or above play sports. The reason I say this is because its hard to only have an A or a B for the whole school year. Its a hard thing to do, but it's not impossible. Sometimes playing sports help people get their grades up because the couch threats to sit that particular person on the bench. If someone really love the things that they do then they will try hard at what they do. I believe that it also goes along with sports. If you try to take sports away from failing student that might not do there work at all or possibly drop out of high school. On the other hand, they might start to make better grades so that they could get back on the team. This is a hard situation to go with because it depends on what type of student he or she is. If I had to choose I would keep them on the team. thank you for reading this letter, please consider it.

From, STUDENT_NAME
