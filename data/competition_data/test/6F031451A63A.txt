Driving has many perks to it, its easy, gets you there faster. But do to all of this driving there are also downsides to it. Driving benefits us, but not driving also has its benfits as well. The advantages of not driving are high, such as less pollution, you save more money. And to be honest it might just be the end of car cultures. People in an upscale community in Vauben, Germany are giving up their cars. Why? you might ask. Because street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in this experimental new district. If you do own a car, you will have to pay a fee to park it on the outskirts of town, and quite frankly many people can not afford that, so they do it the natural way. Which in turns benefits them because they get plenty of exercise.

Continuing on, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The air was so foggy because of the fuel that they used which was diesel fuel. Another perk of limited driving use is that less pollution gets into the air. All of this driving puts smoke into the air, and makes it a very unhealthy environment. Breathing in all of that really affects your lungs and so forth. The smog cleared enough monday for the french party to discard the ban for that day until next time.

Many countries are trying the ''car free day''. Such as Bogota,Columbia,millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during car-free day. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ''Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution", said businessman carlos Arturo Plaza. Many countries are excited about this and say that its a revolutionary change. If many people try this out and see what the benefits are, then they will know that maybe just maybe that this might be best.
