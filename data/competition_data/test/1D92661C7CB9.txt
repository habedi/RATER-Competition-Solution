The idea of driverless cars is extraordinary and could be a great plan and a great source of entertainment. Who would not want a car that drives by itself? The idea is great but it could potentially bring a lot of bad baggage along with it. The world does not need driverless cars because it is unsafe, defeats the purpose of driving, and is a waste of money.

Driverless cars are very unsafe. In the article it talks about all the things they can do, for example, it can steer, accelerate, and brake all by itself! Somehow, someway this is possible, but is it consistent is the question? Throughout the article they talked about tests they did and the results that came with the tests. While describing them the author used phrases like, "It worked well." Only one paragraph in the article they were 'for sure' that it worked. For someone to drive such a car they should have specific clarification that they would be safe while inside this vehicle, and they can trust that they have no worries and that this car will do 80% of the work for them. Also, if the car does most of the work for you, then what is the point of having a car?

Driverless cars defeat the purpose of even having a car. All of the processes you go through as a teenager with getting your permit or license is diminished, and in a sense you did all that work for nothing. The point of driving is having a quicker way of getting to the places you need to be instead of walking, biking, etc. In paragraph 10 it says that an automaking company named 'Tesla' is making a car that can be on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Ask youself, why would you waste your time on getting a car like that when you can ride the bus, train, limo, or taxi that would do 100 percent of the driving for you? That would just make me feel like I'm wasting my money on senseless things.

Driverless cars are also a waste of money. Automakers spend millions, maybe even billions of dollars making prototypes of these cars and testing them. Every time one of the test cars do not work they have to go and make a new one which is money that could be used for something a lot more efficient. The automakers to this day are still doing this, which is throwing money out the window. But not just the automakers are wasting their time and money, if people were to get this car they would be wasting their time and money also. People would waste thousands of dollar on one car that is pointless. Rich or poor this would be a senseless investment, because there are cheaper ways to get where you need to go. Taxi's, limos, buses, and trains are all great affordable ways of transportation. The automakers could find something that is a lot better and cheaper that could change the world.

Driverless cars is again a wonderful, awesome idea. It would definetly have a lot of popularity and publicity but is it really worth it in the long run? The automakers can find a lot of things that could change the world, and this is something the world does not need. The world should not have driverless cars because it is unsafe, defeats the purpose of driving, and is a waste of money.
