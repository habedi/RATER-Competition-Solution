Dear Principle,

I am against the new policy change. I think that the new policy change witch states if students have lower than a grade B average that they may not participate in sports or other activities is not a good idea if most kids have a grade C average because then the school might not have enough kids to make a school football team or basketball or baseball or any other school team sports. If the school doesn't have enough kids to make a hole team then the kids that do meet the requirements of a grade B average wont be able to play on the school team. Also some kids that try there hardest might not be able to reach a grade B average in witch would result in them not being able to participate in sports or other activities even though the kids are trying as hard has they can.

Your student,
