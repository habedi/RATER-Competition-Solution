Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during their break. Many projects are designed and viewed differently. In this case, student-designed projects are more beneficial and productive than teacher-designed projects that are assigned to students. If a student were to design their own project, it would feel less like a homework assignment and more like an exciting activity to do, based on their own rules, and very diverse and full of different ideas.

Imagine a student wanting to stay inside their home to do homework, instead of playing outside with their friends, that is how one would act if their summer assignment was student-designed. A student would feel highly encouraged and motivated if their assignment felt less like a project and more like their own favorite activity. Many students would do anything to avoid homework, but if their homework felt like a video game, they would have the energy to start and finish it without a doubt. With the assignment being a summer assignment, they most likely have a good amount of time to work on it, so, they will not feel pressured or rushed while working on it as well.

Also, students can focus on other homework once they finish the project knowing it is completed and their best work, which will be, since it is student-designed.

Every project has a rubric, but if the project was student-designed, it would be very unique. Yes, the students would have to follow a rubric but it would feel like the students' own rules. They will go with their own imagination and make it more like their own favorite activity, than like a project with strict and vague rules they may not understand. Following their own rules can also result in many creative ideas. Sometimes, a teacher-designed rubric can be confusing and cause stress on a student, affecting them personally, and making it harder for them to comprehend and complete the assignment.

A teacher can also have fun with a student-designed project. Grading the projects may be very entertaining and satisfying to examine. If a teacher chooses to present their students' projects to others, it may be entertaining for the audience as well. Since the projects would be student-designed, they should be unfamiliar to one another so, there is a higher chance for a teacher to come across cheating. They will encounter many different ideas and possibly learn something new from each and every one of their students too!

If a student were to recieve an assignment where they could express their different and creative ideas, create their own rules, and make the assignment feel like their own without feeling pressured and stressed, it would make a huge difference and very much beneficial for both students and teachers. To assure students are continuing to learn over summer break, student-designed projects are more productive and superior than teacher-designed projects.
