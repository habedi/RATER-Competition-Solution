The reason I think that people should become a part of the seagoing cowboys program is because it helps people. It helps people by helping them get there food recovered .

The story shows this on (paragaph 9 ) it says " It made me more aware of people of other contries and thier needs."

Also I people should join seagoing cowboys because it is not just helpin people. On (paragraph 5 ) it says "I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china." Also on (pagraph 5) it says that

"But seeing acropolis in Greece was special ." On (paragraph 5) it also says

" so was taking a gondola ride in Venice." One mor eway that the (UNRRA) is not just help people is "Luke also toured an excavated casle in crete(Paragraph5).

The seagoing cowboys also is not just working all the time. On (pagraph 8) it The cowboys played base ball. " Also they cowboys also played "volleyball game in the emty holes" (paragraph 8. ) Cowboy also played table tennis and fencing . one more thing that te cowboys did for fun was read ,whitttling and played games.
