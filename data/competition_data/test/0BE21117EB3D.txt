All students should be required to perform community service to show that that they care about where they live. And also show that they want a clean place to live. And the reason why i say that is because where i live its nothing but trash. And nobody ever comes out to clean and i wish i could do something about it because i love and like a clean neighborhood to live in. And that's why all student's should do community service and it could bring their grade up a little to show that they care. And plus it will give all teenagers something to do instead of getting into trouble or drinking.

And it will keep them out of jail and doing something good with their teenage life instead of bad stuff like getting high or drinking or smoking weed or shooting or running from the cops. And that's why all students should do community service.

sincerely
