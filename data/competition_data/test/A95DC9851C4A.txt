Dear principal,

We should not have to have a

B

average just to participate in sports or other activities our school provides.

Having a

B

average is to much to ask, most students have a

C

average anyways.

Our school sports wouldn't have enough players to even be in the tournament or any other sports games.

But

I see your concern for having a

B

average because a

C

average is easy to contain.

Maybe you should rethink this a little bit, and have the students, teachers, and couches choose what the appropriate grades are to play sports.

The reason for me believing that it should only be

C

average is very clear and simple.

it would be to hard for a student to have to bring there grades up to a

B

average, and focus on sports.

Some students barley make a

C

average and that is trying there hardest. Most students are good at sports and a

C

Average is just to much to ask.

I do see your point in making it a

B

average.

students come to school to learn to to play sports.

ports are and privilege not a right.

They should come to school for school and that only you can graduate without ever playing sports. But lets be honest a

B average is

Way to much to ask in a student.

By making it a B average you are making school boring some kids only get good or decent grades for sports.
