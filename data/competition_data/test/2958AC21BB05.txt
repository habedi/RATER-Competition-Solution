Dear principal,

I think policy 1 is what we need to have at school. Alot of the kids like to text there friends during school. I think you should let this happen because everybody would be happy even the teachers. Even though the teachers already use there phones during school. If the teachers are aloud to then why cant the students? It would be fair then. Maybe some of the students would actually start doing there work. Then when they start doing there work then the parents will be happy because of there grades getting better.

I would want to have my phone and be able to use it during school because i have friends that are not in school and text me. I also have some of my family texting me that live in a different state. They don't know if imp in school or not and then they get mad and are like why don't you ever text me back and im like well i cant.

I think it would be okay along as they had them of or on silent when class started.

Everyone has been asking to do this so i think we should. If this did ever happing they would not be aloud to call people in school though only text. If they were aloud to call people they would be nobody in school because they would be calling there parents and telling them to come pick you up. I think texting should be aloud.

I love how people in the school still text people though when there not aloud. They never get caught though that's the funny thing. But when they do get caught there like crying and everything. Maybe if they didn't have there phone put then they wouldn't be crying and throwing a big fit. There are alot of teachers that just actually don't care if u have your phone out.

In my old school they didn't care if you had your phone out or your ipod. People would be walking around the hallways and would be texting and listening to there ipod. The teachers didn't ever care about what you did. They never wrote you up for anything. They were always like that okay it will be okay will fix it . They would also be like that's not your fault. I loved that school because we could have are phones out. SO i think they should let us have are phones out, and be able to listen to are ipod.
