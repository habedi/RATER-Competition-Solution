To the Principle

Many students at our school disagree with the fact that your considering changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B average. But I think its a good idea.

Its a good idea because students who do have less than a C average should not be apart of school activities because they should concentrate on their grades and how to make them better . Also students who are participating focus so much on their sports that they don't pay enough attention to school work so their grades drop down. Maybe not being apart of sports for a while can help them regain back the focus they need to do better educationally.

Some students disagree with the policy change because they think they cant do better than a C average. But really they can all they need to do is focus more on school instead of other activities .Also some student with lower than a C average have put so much effort into their activities that they don't think that its fair for them not to be able to continue to participate in sports or activities.

In conclusion its is a good consideration to change the schools sports or activities policy, it may help some students.
