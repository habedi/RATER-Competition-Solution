Principal,

Hello, I have notice you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service. Some might agree with you because our community needs to be taking care of. On the other hand, others might degree because they believe community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. I would like to tell you why i believe that you should be required to perform community service.

Some agree that the community service is needed because we need to take care of our community.

It is very important to take care of the community. If we don't then our community would have litter all over the ground, elementary children need help and if we are not willing to help them then not good grades would be on their report cards. We don't have a lot of people helping in our community services so we need more helpers but the people we do have doesn't regret helping out and serving their job.

Other students however, believes that community service takes too much time away from things they want and need to do. Now a lot of students play sports and homework and etc. but maybe on days that they don't have anything to do or they have extra time they can service the community. Only if it is only an hour at the soup kitchen, I'm sure they wouldn't mind helping out even if it isn't a lot of time.

I believe that students should be required to perform community service because we need to clean up on community and help out. It doesn't matter if it is just an hour or if it is five hours, students need to learn to help out with the surroundings around us. I strongly believe that students need to be required because they will see the fun and great feeling of taking care of the community.

Thank you for taking your time and reading this letter. I hope you understand my thoughts about your decision.

Take care, fellow students.
