Dear Principal,

I know that you probably think that cell phones are disrupting classes. I know that you probably think that school is not the place for cell phones. I know that you have reasons that you should just ban cell phones from this school altogether. I know that you think that kids should just go use the school phone if they really need to contact someone. Kids these days, just don't work like that. Do you remember what it felt like to be a teenager? Contact with other kids is vital to surviving in middle school and high school. So, I don't think that you should ban cell phones from our school. I think that students should be able to have their cell phones out during lunch and free periods, and I do agree that phones should be turned off during all of our classes.

First of all, teenagers text their friends. I know this because, well, I text my friends all the time. I don't really spend my time texting my family because I'm usually always with them when I'm outside of school. When I go to school, I'm with my friends just as much as I'm with my family when I'm at home. So, what's the harm in letting kids have their cell phones at lunch? Most of the people that they text are going to be sitting right next to them anyway. So, I don't think there's going to be much of a difference there. At free periods, though, kids are going to want to stay in contact. Honestly, when there's nothing else to do, I usually just pull out my cell phone and start texting other people. So, during free time, when there's nothing else to do, kids should be able to keep in contact with each other, just to give them something to do, if they have nothing better to do.

Sometimes, it's hard to talk to people face to face, especially in school. Sometimes, you can't find the person you want to talk to, or sometimes, you just don't really want to physically get up and go talk to them. For some reason, this actually seems to happen a lot. Cell phones have kind of created this phenomenon that you don't have to go and talk to people face to face... You can just call them or text them. If a student is trying to find another student, without getting up and actually having to go and find them, they can just take two seconds and type, "Where are you?" or they can just call them. It's as simple as that. Letting kids have their phones at certain times in school would save a lot of people a lot of time.

So, in conclusion, kids should be able to have their cell phones out at certain times during the school day like lunch, and free time. It would make kids enjoy school a whole lot more, trust me. Cell phones have kind of become a part of teenagers. I know that my teenager years, and a lot of other kids' teenage years are made up of cell phones and text messaging and all of this new technology. So, if you take away cell phones in our school for good, you kind of take away a part of who we are. I think that you should really think about this before you just ban cell phones from our school completely.

Sincerely,
