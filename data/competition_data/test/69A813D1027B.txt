How amazing would it be if you were able to detect exactly how other people are feeling? It would be great, would it not? Well, with new software called the Facial Action Coding System, you are able to do just that. The use of this technology could be extremely valuable to students in a classroom.

This software has classified six basic emotions-happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Having stated this, this software can inform teachers on how their students are feeling. In paragraph 6 of the article, it states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." If teachers know exactly how their students are feeling, they can provide better aid. This is only possible if the Facial Action Coding System is implemented in schools.

Although, we can probably tell how a student is feeling simply by the look on their face, it is not as effective as using this software. Teachers do no have the time to be guessing how their students are feeling. It would waste too much time. If this technology would be implemented in schools, teachers would be able to help more students in a more efficient mannner.

The implementation of this technology in schools would be amazing, hands down. Not adopting this technology would be an ignorant choice. Knowing what students are struggling in would be made easy. Also, teachers would be able to provide aid to more students than before. Its benefits outweigh any negatives that might be present.
