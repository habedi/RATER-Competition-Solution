Dear Mr.Senator,

I believe that the United States should switch the precidential election process to popular vote. This is due to the fact that the U.S. has grown up, and as a people we need to vote for who we believe to be a great and capable leader for our country and we can't let other people vote for us. I think that the origanal thought behind the electoral college, compromise, was good in its time, but now is no longer the time for compromise, even if the electoral college has some right ideas, such as helping us choose the correct leader. I believe it is obvious to see we will fail and make mistakes as a result of choosing our own leaders,however it is more important and more benefitial that we make our own mistakes. We need to learn from them ourselves rather than to be stopped and pointed into a direction before getting the chance to decide which path we take. Like I said before the U.S. is a big boy, it's time to take the training wheels off.

To support my idea that America should run off popular vote I shall point out some flaws with the idea the electoral college. The electoral college isn't equal. There are an unequal amount of people per state, and even though we divide power amongst those representatives equally there still isnt equal say among them as individuals, meaning a group of repsentatives from one state and one representative from another state could have the same power. How is that equal? Only in the sense that each state itself has the same amount of play in the election, but they don't, some states actually get looked over everytime the election happens. Another problem is that the representatives don't represent each person in the state or what they yern for in their leader, just the state itself. On top of the fact that the people aren't properly represented right, the people who are actually voting can just vote for who they like, which points to the fact that the electoral college has the possibility to be immoral and completely wrong.

A nation that is run by the people should be run by the people. It was said that "a house divided cannot stand." Now the subject that this qoute pertains to is different than that of the one I am using it in, but it is still true. The government should be as it was intended, run by the people to create a better and greater tomorrow. The people deserve the popular vote.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
