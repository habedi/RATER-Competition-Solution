Dear principal,

I think you should let us have cell phones. Cause many people want to text in school . And that at lunch time we should be able to use our cell phones because many people be having important call it might be an emergency like during class or lunch time. I need a cell phone in class or school cause many important people be calling me and if i don't answer it i might get in trouble. And that cell phones is important we should have them because its a usual thing like so you can text your friends and ask them questions and so u can play games on your phone cause during class you don't get to play no games. We should be able to use them at recess cause we are outside we not in the building no more we should be able to call people and text people and play ring tones. And that we should be able to play ring tones during class because it help you concentrate on our work and that we should be able to step outside to call our parents cause it might be important or emergency. That we could have free time during class so that we can use our phones.
