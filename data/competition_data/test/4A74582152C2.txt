Should We or Should We Not Use Phones While Driving?

I personally belive that we shouldn't be active on a phone while driving. Driving while being active on a phone has caused 1.6million crashes each year. On the other hand nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents in the united states is caused by the phone usage. I tell my older siblings to not be on the phone while driving or not to text, you never know what might happen because 9 times out of 10 your interested in whats on the phone more than the road that your suppose to be focusing on. I know someone who actually past away from a wreck and there eyes where on the road so its a greater chance of wrecking when your eyes aren't on the road.

A lot of people don't belive in having to not use something they paid for at anytime until they experience a wreck or hurt someone els. Like why even risk losing your life because you wanted to be on the phone while driving. There are even ways to prevent crashing while talking on the phone like putting it on the bluetooth it's even been proven to be the best way to talk while driving.

The reason me myself and other people say bluetooth would be the best solution is because you won't have to fumble with the phone while talking and driving you would have it right in your ear. Bluetooths are wireless earphones which you don't have to have your phone in your hand. It could easily be a situation were your talking on the phone while it's in between your cheek and shoulder and it slip and you try to catch your phone and lose control driving that's why i prefer bluetooth.

Driving while talking can be done in a way but texting while driving is another thing. Texting while driving is dangerous because your eyes won't be a hundred percent focused on the road. I do not agree with texting while driving it's totally different from talking while driving. You will have to be hands on and looking at the phone in order to text. Meaning you while have one hand on the steering wheel and be looking back in forth from phone to road.
