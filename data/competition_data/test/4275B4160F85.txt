Dear Principal,

I believe that policy 1 would be better for our school, because I think that students should be able to have their cell phones out during school hours and not get in trouble. Cell phones should be able to be used at school. Students should be able to have their cell phones out at lunch and during passing period. while in class people's phones should be on silent, so that it doesn't interrupt the class. Cell phones should be used at school in case of emergencies, and sometimes your family needs to get a hold of you at school. If the phones become a distraction the teacher or someone should tell the student to turn their phone off, but they shouldn't ruin it for the rest of the students. Therefore everyone else should be able to keep their phones out as long ass they are not a distraction. Most teachers have their cell phones out, so why wouldn't students be able to have theirs? It wouldn't be fair that a teacher can just answer their phone in the middle of class while a student has to have their phone taken away. What if that call the student was getting was for some kind of emergency? Then they wouldn't have been able to help out with what ever happened. I believe that all schools should allow cell phones out on campus during school hours. Cell phones can be used as a way of getting help at school, for example if you don't understand something, you could just text a friend for some help, and if your friend doesn't understand it either, that's when you know you should ask for help from the teacher. Another example of why cell phones should be allowed at school is because if a student were to see an intruder coming on to school grounds, and no other adult was there to see it, the student could just pick up their cell phone and call the office or if its really serious they could even call the police. When cell phones become a distraction, that's when the school staff should be allowed to take away the phones or at least tell the student to turn it on silent. Another example of why there should be cell phones allowed at school would be because of some kids that can't speak the same language as everyone else, they could text other students that speak their language and get help from them. If a student needs a book from the library, they could just text the librarian about the book that they need, instead of interrupting the class to go get a book from the library. If a student needs something from home, instead of interrupting the teacher during class, they could just text their mom and ask if she could bring what ever it is that they need from home. And that concludes the reason for letting students have cell phones out during school.
