If the principal decided that all students must do one extracurricular activity, I would most likely agree with it because I think it's good to get out the house and try new things. I think it would also help with making new friends and meeting new people. It could help them stay active and make them feel good about them self and could put them in a happier place and stands. And

They could find something they really enjoy doing.

There is a little part of me that makes me disagree a little. At home they could have a ruff home life so they have no ride home, their parents don't support them so they would not help out of come to there games or to the meetings for the activity, and they could not be able to get the stuff they need for that sport. I would say sports has really helped me make new friends and become a better person and stay active and fit.

But for me I would have to go with agree because I think it is good for kids to stay active,to get out and ex- prole new things, make new friends, meet new people , staying active, and staying in shape. That could also mean that is there time to get away from everything like maybe something happening at home and they need a break or maybe they are getting bullied so that is there set away from everything. so I think I would say I am gonna go with agree.
