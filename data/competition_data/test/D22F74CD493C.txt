Venus sounds like a really cool planet from all of the things I've read from this passage. The author has done really well in supporting this claim because he/she explained where Venus is, said why venus could be very challening to explore, and what NASA can try to do to complete the challenging exploration of venus.

My first reason of my the author has done on this claim is that he/she explained where Venus is located in space. according to the passage Venus is the second planet from the sun. Also it is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the closest in distance. It is said that both Venus and Mars are Earth's planetary neighbors. Earth, Venus, and Mars all orbit the sun in different speeds.

My second reason is why Venus could be very challenging to explore. It might not be a good idea for humans to got to Venus because it could be really hostile for people. NASA might have a possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. In other words its not proven to be safe around Venus yet but through time NASA will firgure out a way for sure if Venus is safe for us nor not.

My last reason is what NASA can try to do to complete the challenging exploration of Venus. It is said as of now that scientists are seeking a way to get close and personal to Venus despite the risks. They are trying to find a way to make our vehicles to last longer to get more information on Venus. They are also working on other approches to studying Venus. NASA has old computers called mechanical computers. Mechanical computers were created in the 1800's and played a big role in World War 2.

In conclusion, the author has done a fantastic job on getting information on whats going on with NASA and Venus. Venus isn't confirmed on being a planet that we can live on but NASA is doint their best to see that they can do in order to see if we can.
