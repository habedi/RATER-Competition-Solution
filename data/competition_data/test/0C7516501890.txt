Twenty five years ago a face was discovered on mars. NASA said that it was a rock that resembles a face. The rock had the look of eyes, nose, and a head. This is something that NASA and us scientist have never seen before. NASA hasn't figured out if it really is a face or just a rock. The face theory's do not make any scince.

The face has become an icon as it has made apperences in movies, books, and magazines. Many scientist have thought that the cause of the face was because of aliens. Then NASA wanted to figure out what it was so they sent a Orbiter Camera. They found out that there was no alien resemblence at all. The face was very hard to find. As it states in the article "The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was wunter in April '98 a cloudy time of year" (page 8, Unmasking the Face on Mars).

"It's not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. "In fact it's hard work" (page 9, Garvin). The face was hard to detect and took a lot of work to figure out what it really is. Scientist are still doing research on the face shaped rock. They are even sending space crafts with camera's to take pictures of the face. So far, they are not having any luck on getting a picture that isn't blurry. The face has become one of the most interesting and confusing things in science and still hasn't been solved today.
