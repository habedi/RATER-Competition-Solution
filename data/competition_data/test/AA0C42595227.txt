Dear Principal,

I am very against your new policy for the new, B average policy for sports and activities.

I do not agree that students shouldn't be allowed to play in sports or join clubs if their average is below a B.

In previous years, the C average policy for sports and extra-curricular activities has worked. Those students had a higher risk of being kicked out of their program, but at least it gave them a fair chance. Besides, a C is the letter grade given to represent "average."

I have an A average, but I have still gotten below a B before and I certainly don't think that if I started a sport, and my grade suddenly went down to below a B average, that I should not be able to participate in it.

I know plenty of people who struggle with changes in the school year, and those stressful times can change how their grade comes out.

I also don't think that it would be fair to students who have kept their C average steady throughout the years, so that they could partake in the activities that they have always wanted to be in, because if you changed the policy, those students would be furious.

I'm sure that there are other students who are not going to support your new plan, including some of the students who have C averages.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
