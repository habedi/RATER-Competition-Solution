I believe that these projects should be teacher designed because it would be easier to understand, there will be a good amount of information needed, and the directions that would be given from the teachers would be put in the right order so the student knows what he/she is doing.

The reason I believe that projects should be teacher designed because it would be easier to understand. Students would rather have a project to do on their own, but still need the assistance or guide for them to know what to do in what way and how to do it. That is why there would be a list of instructions a teacher would give to their student so they can understand what they're doing on the project and how to get the right information. Some students lose most of their knowledge during the summer because they don't go to school over break which is a long period of time. To prevent that from happening, teachers assign work for the students to do over the break.

I also believe that because there will be a good amount of information given from the teacher. If the students don't have a clue of what to do on the project, they will not be able to do the project. Although, if the teacher can give a good amount of information, along with the project, then the student will understand what to do, where to get more information about the subject, and will gain more knowledge over the remaining time during the summer.

Also, I believe that the teachers should give the students a list of directions so they know what to do and in what order, such as a syllabus. If they don't know what they're looking for, then they won't be able to give the right information on the project. The teacher could give the students sources to get their information from, require them to read books on that subject, or assist them and tell them where to get the remaining information from and what to put. They will be lost and won't understand what to do and how to do the project because of the fact that there is no instructions, no syllabus, and no help to be given. So therefore, the students won't be able to do anything on the project because they'd be confused and won't know what to do.

I also happen to disagree that the project shouldn't be student designed because they are doing whatever on the project and don't know what the project is about, there isn't instructions, and they can't request for help.

Students are allowed to let their imagination roam free, especially on a school project, but they need to know what they're dealing with and how to do so. Without instructions to help them, they won't be able to do the project right and it will be even harder for them to do simply because of the fact that there aren't any directions to guide the students and to give them the information they need to complete the project.

And to add on, any school project should come with directions to assist the student and to help him/her so they won't be confused during the completion of the project. If there is no instructions given, then the project will be harder to complete and harder to understand. The students would be confused on what the project is about, how to complete the project, and where to get the best information form. Every student needs a guide or instructions to do homework or projects, but of course they need support on doing so. They will be questioning themselves on what to do and how to do it.

Finally, students can try to ask for help, but everyone else will be just as confused. If there are no instructions and no way of telling how to do the project or what it is about, then getting assistance will be even harder than doing there project. The reason why it will be harder is because the people you ask for help will question themselves on what the project is about, where to get the information, and why there isn't any given instructions on how to do the summer assignment. If the students ask their parent or guardian, they'll either try to help, even though they are just as confused as the student, or they'll question where the directions are and if there isn't any, why?

I believe that these projects should be teacher designed because it would be easier to understand and it would rather help them understand than being confused, there will be a good amount of information needed and they'll know what to do on the project, and the directions that would be given from the teachers would be put in the right order so the student knows what he/she is doing. I also disagree that the project shouldn't be student designed because they are doing whatever on the project and don't know what the project is about which will cause confusion and lead to the project being incomplete, there isn't instructions which will lead to the student not doing any work simply because he/she doesn't know what to do, and they can't request for help because no one else, besides the teacher, knows what the project is about and how to complete it.Â
