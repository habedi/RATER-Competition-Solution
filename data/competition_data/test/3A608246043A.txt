In the United States one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and about 1500 people are injured by these irresponsible people. Most of the time its because they are texting while driving. Technology has drastically increased. They seem to use their devices more than anything, which cause them to not want to put their phone down because they are afraid they might miss something. I feel like no matter what happens people might think they know how to pay attention. You still shouldn't do it because you never know what might happen one day.

People feel like they have to reply to a text message immediately , which leads to vehicular accidents that may result in death. The age group that are involved in these accidents is 16 year olds and up to 30. This should take a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person if you text while drive, it can cause your life or someone else's.

However, in 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes due to distracted drivers. For this reason, it is very important that we find a way to break the habit of texting and driving. If we don't stop this now the rate of accidents and deaths will quickly increase. Law enforcement have came out with a law when you can not have the phone in your hand , do this work? No, people still text and drive and end up injured or killed. Because of this we should put our phones down or turn them off if you can't keep your hands off it. A text or post can wait if it means it will save your life and someone else's.

Some people might say "i can multi-task" or "i know what im doing". Those that's saying these things are the main ones that in involved in accidents. No matter what you think you can do you should still always be safe. For example, say you are texting while driving and some one walks across the street and you look up to late then BOOM!, another accident. Always go the safe route and keep your phones put away to avoid these situations.

However, I strongly agree that texting and driving is very dangerous and I have the responsibility to put my phone down and focus on the rode. Texting and driving is the most dangerous thing on the rode today due to all of the technology we have. LIfe is more important then texting someone back , ask yourself this will they cause their life just to text you back fast?
