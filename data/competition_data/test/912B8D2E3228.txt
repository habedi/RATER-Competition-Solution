Consequences for texting and driving.

In recent years there have been many studies conducted on how texting while driving is dangerous and the negative outcomes that usually happen. I believe nobody should operate a cell phone in any capacity while driving. One reason that you shouldn't use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you aren't considering other motorists. If you're too busy texting or talking you become distracted and you aren't concentrated on the road anymore. So many car accidents are caused by texting and driving. According to Georgia's driving statistics there are 3287 deaths each day from distracted driving. Texting and driving is illegal in the state of Georgia. On July 1st 2018 they made a law and it says "all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state is prohibited from holding or supporting..." you know it's a pretty serious situation if the entire state of Georgia made a law about it.

Texting and driving also set bad examples for kids and other people. Often when you are operating a vehicle you have other passengers like young kids and teenagers. You don't want to text and drive in front of them because they may start to think that's the right thing to do. Kids tend to mock behaviors that they see others doing and if the mock the texting and driving habit those type of accidents will never stop. Due to texting and driving teens are 400 percent more likely to get into an accident. Teen drivers being distracted by cell phones is the number one killer in teenage deaths. With teens being so inexperienced with driving they need a completely focused and structured driving zone so that their full attention is on the road and nothing else.

Did you know that texting and driving slows your reaction time? Researchers at Texas A&M transportation conducted a "how your reaction time is affected" project. The normal reaction time without any distractions was one to two seconds, when you're texting and driving the reaction time number shoots up to four or five seconds. You may think "oh whatever four to five" seconds isn't enough time to cause any damage" and in reality, if you're not paying attention for one second a lot can go wrong especially behind the wheel. Finally, one accident and your insurance goes sky high. Why would you want to pay money for something this is preventable? Texting and driving is pretty easy not to do. If you feel like you absolutely can't keep your hands off the phone there are tips to help with that. One thing you could do is put It inside of the glover department so that you can't reach it. One last tip that you could so is have a passenger (if you have one) to hold your phone so you can't get to it.

Now think about it...is texting and driving worth it? All the things that could go bad if you are distracted and driving should encourage you to drive distraction free. I think in order to prevent all these accidents among teens especially is to have cars that blocks out service so that phone access is completely impossible! Now that you've read this will you change, or will you continue to make the same careless decisions? Texting and driving accident percentages can go down if we all try to stop. People are dying and getting seriously injured because of that. Today let's make a promise that we will put the phones down and travel safe!
