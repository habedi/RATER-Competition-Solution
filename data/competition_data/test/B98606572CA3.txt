Dear principal,

I believe that the first policy, in which students are allowed to use cell phones in free time, would be the best to use. I think this policy would well for everyone. There are a few reasons why I think this would be the best policy. I think the first policy would be the best because it would allow the students to have more freedom, not have to use them during class, and they would be able to use their phones for important things.

The first reason I think the first policy should be used is that it would allow students to have more freedom. Some listen to music on their phones. this would give students a chance to unwind and even play games on phones. Also, they could call or text anyone who doesn't sit by them.

The next reason i think students should be allowed to have cell phones is that they wouldn't have to use them during class. If cell phones are allowed in free periods, the students won't have to get them out in class because they could do in free period whatever they needed to use a phone for. They could already have called or sent text messages to whoever they needed to and could focus on class work.

My last reason for this policy to be used is if they need their phones for something. They could use them to call their parents if they left something at home, for example. If you left your homework or gym clothes at home, you could call your parents without having to walk all the way to the office to use the school's phone.

In conclusion, cell phones should be allowed in free periods because it gives students more freedom, they won't have to use it later, and they can use their phones for something important.

I think, overall, the first policy is the best one to use. Besides, people already get their phones out in free time. This would just make it allowed. I hope you'll make the right choice.

Sincerely,
