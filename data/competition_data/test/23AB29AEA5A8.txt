As americans, we use vehicles quite a bit. From driving to school and work, to going to the gym or hanging out with friends. But although we use these 4-wheeled machines on a regular basis, would limiting the usage of cars be benefitial?

Despite the fact that we use vehicles as our primary source of transportation, cars are actually polluting the air, and causing danger in our lives. According to paragraph 9, in the source titled

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

; many places, including the United States, are promoting "car reduced" communities. It is believed that America's "love affair" with its vehicles seems to be cooling, as recent studies show "Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by" Which was quoted in source 4, titled

Bill Ford, of Ford motor company, proposed to partnering with the telecommunitcations industry to create cities where transportation traffic is conjoined with a connected network to conserve resources and improve safety.

In a sense of taking away stress and trying to lower air pollution,  residents of Bogota, Colombia and Vauban, Germany have been biking, hiking, and skating to work. Residents have claimed to have been happier, and less tense since the car free environment came about. In France, however, a "partial driving ban" was set to clear the air, after days of a near-record pollution.

Cars are used on a daily basis. But if we ease off the gas and start hitting the breaks on the use of cars in modern day, would it make America a happier place?
