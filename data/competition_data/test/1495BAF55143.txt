Community service is helpful and shows caring. Some people think community service is a waste of time, but it helps others and in ways helps you to. Community service shows caring, helps you in a college application, and sometimes make others happy.

Community service shows caring by helping the environment. Some community service requires picking up trash on high ways, or really any where. Helping the environment is very important, our factories are already polluting the air . So by sighing up for community service and picking up trash, it can make a difference, and is one less thing that is polluting our air.

Community service, doesn't only help the environment but also helps you in a better education. Many colleges look to see if you have done any community service, so by having that on your application you are more likely to be picked. By starting young, on doing community service, you have more years to do more and more community service. It would be a shame if you weren't able to get into a college just because u didn't do any community service.

By pursing to do community service, it doesn't just help you but also helps others. Many elderly people in homes are alone , and need someone to be there with them. By sighing up to help in a elderly home you make others feel happy and not alone. Elders sometimes have families that live far away and miss there children, but by going over there and keeping them company it makes you happy as well as the elders.

Community service helps our society and environment. Just by sighing up it shows carrying, helps you in college applications, and makes others happy. I strongly agree that community service should be required, in all generations.
