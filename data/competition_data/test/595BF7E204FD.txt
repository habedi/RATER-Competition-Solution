Dear Principal,

I believe policy one would be the better choice for several reasons. first and foremost some times we need to use our cell phones during school.

What would you do if you got in an accident and no one could contact your child's school to tell them they would need another form of transportation home? What would you do then? If they were allowed their use their cell phones during lunch period you could easily contact them and make sure they got home safely.

Another reason is what if your child got sick at school and went to the nurse but the nurse said they were fine, if your child still doesn't feel well they would be able to contact you and you cold come pick them up. What if your child has asthma and they need their inhaler ,the school doesn't have one. You child could call you and tell you to come bring it for them in their time of need.

That is why i believe policy one is the much better choice. Don't you?
