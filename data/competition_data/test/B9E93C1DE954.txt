Experts are coming up with a new technology "Facial Action Coding System" that is supposed to read students facial expressions. Prof. Thomas Huang , of Beckman Institute and Prof. Nicu Sebe are working together to develope more ways for humans and computers to communicate. This is how the process begins, the computer constructs a 3-D model of your face, all 44 major muscles must move like facial muscles. Each facial expression is unviersal for each emotion is also. Each expression is then compared aganist a face that shows no emotion. With all the details and similarites to real facial structures this new software could actually be very useful, but not all students are going to want a machine reading thier face every so often or even at all. Imagine coming into school and the staff is just like "Hey we want to try this new machine on you guys". everyone is going to be scared for one and then on the other hand their going to be really uncomfortable and may even call the board.
