Honestly this would raise test scores because you are encouraging student to work harder so they can play sports, but your always going to have those few student who are going to change schools because of the new rule in place. So i think this is NOT a good idea to make students have at least a B average to play on a sports team.

First of all the biggest issue would be the lost in students. This would be a big issues because your always going to have those handful of student who are going to have that attitude that if i cant play i want to switch schools.

This would be a problem because this is saying that they can do it they just don't choose to because getting a C average is something the comes easy to them because it doesn't require a lot of work ethnic. So in result to changing the average from a C to a B your going to lose students because there going to go to the next best school who don't have the sports grade average so high.

Secondly, doing this may cause you to not have a big team and you may lose some of your best players. Most of the time boys who play sports grades aren't just all A' s or A' s and B' s its around a C average meaning they might have a few A' s some B' s and a C or two. The reason behind this is that there not going to care and there not going to play on the team because they grades do not fit the standards. Losing your best players put your at a greater risk of loosing every game you play so this is not something you should look into doing if you want to win all your games and fill up your school trophy case.

In addition to losing students to other schools and players just not playing on the team, you might have a few parents complaining why they son or daughter can not play basketball or football or another sport of the choosing. This would be a issue because you might have everybody on the teams mom or dad in the office trying to talk to the principle or in the sports directors face trying to bribe them to letting there child play on the team.

So in turn this would NOT be a good idea because of the fact most student that play sports are right on the border line because they have a C average to start with, not saying you don't have students who play on the team who are getting all A' s because in some cases you do. Stating this it could be beneficial and bad at the same time.
