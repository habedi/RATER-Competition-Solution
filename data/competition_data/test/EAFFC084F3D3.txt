I dont agree with the principals decision. For my reason is this. One, we don't have to go if we want to.

Two, we can make our own decisions and not for an adult to make decisions for us. For an example, if a person does something without your permission they're making decisions for you. Although, If that person comes up to you and asks " hey there is a really cool sale going on hoodies and they want to ship the first hoodie for free." " I just want to know if you're okay if I tell them your address." If you say no you are making a decision not to tell them your address. Same thing goes for school. If an adult starts to tell you something that you do not want to do. Then don't do it and don't listen to them but if it's beneficial to what you have to do by all means do it.

Since our principal made the "decision"

that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity he or she is basically but not really forcing us to stay after school and do other things than our homework or projects. Since our principal decided we have to do after school activities, there are some kids that play sports outside of school. For an example, if I had to stay after school and do an activity I might miss my football meet this Friday/Saturday. If I don't show up I might miss my chance of showing to the coaches what i'm capable of.

For that incident I might not be able to join an outside football team. There might be some times where you have to listen and do what the person is telling you to do.

Since the principal made the decision to make stay after school to do an extracurricular activity, we might as well do it even though i'm not very fond of people making decisions for me. I can do a few thing until I completely lose interest in a certain subject.. Since it's only one thing we have to do how hard can it be but my answer still stands on me disagreeing with the principal on staying after school and doing an extracurricular activity. There might be some kids thinking " oh well I need to stay after school so I can get my grades raised" the only club that might get your grades raised is the homework club and that club is for people that have a lot of homework on their hands. Since that is not considered an extracurricular activity by the principle you might as wellÂ stay after school and go to that club either way.
