World War II has started in Europe and they need help. This is time that you can be a Seagoing Cowboy. You could go on a ship over the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. You can help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA, aka the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and they have joined with us, the Seagoing Cowboys. We need help to save these countries, so come on down and sign up to become one.

You can get orders to go to places like New Orleans or Greece. You would have so much fun going there. And you would get free time after you finish. And you would need a partner to help you get the supplies out. At night, you'll need to be a watchman to keep on guard and also find the people you're trying to get to. So you need to be awake. You will need to your duty for these people. If you graduated from high school, you can join us like Luke and Don.

You can be a great person for those people in the countries. And for your free time, you can play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and game to help pass the time. Your friends could beat you in those games.

You could have an adventure with us. Luke said, "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs" and that is true. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. You could be Luke as well by helping many people become saved by you and your partner.
