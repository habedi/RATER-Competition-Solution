Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity such as a sport or a club. I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because it helps build friendships, raise your low grades, and allows you to experience new things.

The first reason after school activities are beneficial is that they can build a strong and lasting friendship. I remember when I was in elementary school and my mom signed me up for after school basketball. The first few days and even weeks I hated it. I had no friends there or even someone I had seen before. I was scared and shy. Most of the kids were way older than me and looked huge. Most days I sit on the sideline watching them, wishing I could be that good. Suddenly the tallest kid of them all walks up to me and asked if I would like to join them in a game. I was in shocked and happy at the same time. I told the boy I would love to join. every day after that for three years I played with them after school. Eventually me and that boy became best friends and didnt do anything without each other. We played basketball together, watched movies, played cops and robbers, and had sleepovers. Five years later we are still best friends.

The second reason after school activities are beneficial is because they can help raise your grades and test scores. Studies show that students who participate in homework clubs and study clubs generally have higher test scores. This means the students who have higher grades can get into better colleges, and students in better colleges can get higher paying jobs. From just attending after school homework clubs students have already made a step towards their goals of getting a good high paying job to support their family.

The third reason after school activites are beneficial is because they allow students to experience new things. At my middle school we have so many different clubs and activities that everyone can find something they enjoy. I wish I could experience every single club we have but that is just not possible. Before I joined the cooking club I could only use a microwave and toaster. The amazing teacher taught me how to bake and make really fancy dishes for family gatherings or holidays. Before this class my Mom and Grandma cooked for Christmas. Now that I am able to help it feels wonderful because it is more time that I can use to bond with my family and friends.

In conclusion I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because they are great places to build friendships, improve your grades, and experience new things.
