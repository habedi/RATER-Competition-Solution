Luke joined a group called the Seagoing Cowboys. Being a Seagoing Cowboy sounds really fun. I would LOVE to travel the world.

If I could join the Seagoing Cowboys, I think it would be really fun. It would be amazing to travel the world. It could only allow guys to join though. If it only allows guys I would not rest until they let me become a Seagoing Cowboy.

I would join the program because, I would get to explore the world. Also, I would get to travel. I love to travel and explore. One time when I was exploring in my woods, I found a HUGE deer stand and a family of racoons. Then when I was traveling to

Missouri, me and my little sister PROPER_NAME were getting ready to watch a movie in the car when we saw this GIGANTIC jail house. It was CRAZY!!!

I wouldn't join the pragram because, I would have to leave my family and they probably don't have good food. I have never left my family.

only left them when I was going to a friends house to stay the night. Now about the food. One time I had to eat something so bad it made me sick. If the program had that kind of food, I would probably either DIE, get REALLY sick, or jump over borad (even if the water below is FREEZING cold).

So, that is what I would do if I joined the Seagoing Cowboys or I had to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It would be fun or it could be terrible.
