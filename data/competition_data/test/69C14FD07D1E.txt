Making Mona lisa Smile

I agree that using technology to read students emotional expressions is valuable because you can communicate more with your expression not just with people but also with computers. For example from text,"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communtication,"notes Dr. hang."

It helps students because it shows the computer your emotion when you don't understand something and it's like a teacher seeing your face while you do work on something sam way it works on a compueter. Text from paragraph 6, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored",Dr. hang predicts.'' It can also be just a painting and it can show the emotions of the painting you can use it even identifys your mixed emotions, Text from passage,"Using vido imaginary, the new emotion-reconigtion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or a painted face of Mona Lisa."

The same way you see someones expression when you talk to them is the same way the computer will show it, you may not always be accurate sometimes you may think they're sad when they're really happy same for compueters text from paragraph 5,"Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,ect."

Using technology is valuable to students, it shows another way to communicate, it shows if your smile if real or fake, it's like other people are being able to detect your feelings even if you don't want them to see it. Students can also learn different expressions they thought they didn't have example from text," According to the facial feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."
