Some people think the face was created by aliens. Others argue and say it was formed by shadows and landmasses. Do you think it was created by aliens or a landmass? Do you think aliens are real? I think it was created by a landmass because there is no facts that any aliens are true. I also think aliens are a myth because we would already have facts and we have already told everyone. I bet someone just made up a story and told people they were real.

While NASA is taking pictures of places to land on Mars they spot something. They spotted a face on Mars they don't know how or what it's made of. A few days later NASA unveiled the image so everyone could see the face. It got so popular people started calling it the "Face on Mars" and it became a pop icon. It also starred in everyhting from Hollywood films, books, magazines, radiotalk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years (1-5).

Few scientists belived the face was alien artifact. Jim Garvin took a couple of pictures of it as soon as they could. Finally the team took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original ones. Not everyone was satisfied with the pictures they took. It was hard getting a good shot of the face because Mars had seasons and when they took the pictures it was winter there. With a lot of pwople not liking the picture they needed to try again but when. When will the Face appear again to get that perfect picture (6-9).

After they took the pictures they thought they were never going to get another chance to get better pictures. Then all of that changed on April 8, 2001 when there was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. All they had to do was roll the scapecraft 25 degrees to center the Face and take the picture. Garvin said "It reminds me most of Midlle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." He also states his rule "As a rule of thumb, oyu can discern thiings in a digital image 3 times bigger han a pixel size." If there was anything on the ground near the Face then they would be able to see it because of the pixels were a lot better (10-12).

People might argue that its an alien who put the face on Mars but we have no evidence that aliens are real. It has to be a landmass and some shadows because we would already have known about aliens if they existed. It might look like an alien created this with the Viking photo in 1976 but in this picture it shouldn't. We have gotten a lot more advanced from then and we can also zoom in more so we can see the shadows and landforms outline a lot better. When they took that picture they would have noticed thet aliens did it also because of the rule of thumb.
