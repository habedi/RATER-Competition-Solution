Why Should I Disagree To Let Students Do Extracurricular Activity's

Extracurricular activity's is not a good chose because a lot of students dont like going to school,and dont like to participate in activity's. The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with his dissection because most of the students will not want to participate in a activity. The students will just sit there and do nothing or they'll fall asleep. And there are more reasons why students should not always participate in activities.

The principal made that rule but the students that dont want to do it they'll get in trouble. And for them getting in to much trouble it can affect there life and also it can affect there grads. Students should have the right to choose what they want and what they dont want,because it would not be fair. For example,The students needed stay after school for an activity but they couldn't go. The extracurricular activity's are great sometimes because you have more time to hang out with your friends and stuff,but when they dont let you then thats when students get mad. I would not join an activity because when i get home i dont have time to do all my stuff at home. Students get annoyed when teacher tell them to do something they dont want to.

All the schools from Generic_City have good and bad rules. They dont let you do what you want to do even sometimes you get in trouble for not going to your activities. Students often dont have time to be doing activities or they dont have much important to them. Also they can be scared to go because their scared to get bulled by someone. Their are many reasons why students should not participate in activities. If a student picks a sport like soccer they can get hurt in many ways and in some other sports. People get bored when their just sitting their listening to the teacher. They also can get distracted easily and then they get in trouble for talking. The teachers can also be to much they get mad if your chewing gum in class and then they be like "IM GOING TO GIVE YOU A REFFERL FOR CHEWING GUM."

The teachers can make some other fun activity's so the students can enjoy there time with there friends. Some students can be lazy to even think about doing activities. I mean a lot of people out there can have different ideas some dont think the same like others do. The county should make more activities that are excited so students can go and learn more stuff so they can understand that maybe activities can not be that bad. Students may look like their distracted but maybe their not,maybe its because they dont know how to do something in the activity. Thats why I wouldn't agree to this decision that the principal made.
