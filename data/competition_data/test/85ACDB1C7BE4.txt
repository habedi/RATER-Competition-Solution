Have you ever done something you never thought you would do? In fact I actually have. I participated in a activity I didn't think I was good at. I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity like playing sports, work on the yearbook, and join the student counsel. These are activities that students would probably be interested in if they just participated. Reasons being that they would be more active, they could figure out a new hobby, and they could meet new people.

My first reason why I agree with this decision is because student would be more active. Some students now just like to stay home and be on their phone all day or watch television. I think that it isnt healthy because they arent keeping themselves active by just staying home all day. For example I used to stay home all day everyday, but now I play on a soccer team and it keeps me healthy, active, and happy. I enjoy what I do, and I think that students should be able to have that same feeling. It dosen't have to be a sport that they play, but it can at least be something to keep them active and entertained.

My second reason is because students would be able to discover new hobbies. They could discover new things like playing sports, joining student council, and even working on the yearbook. There are many activities to choose from and students just have to get out of their comfort zone and figure out what best fits them. For example when I first started playing soccer I didn't think it was going to be fun for me, but then I started getting more into it and then I realized it was now a hobby for me since I liked it so much. And now I love going to the field with my dad whenever I don't have practice.

My last reason is students would be able to meet new people. Meeting new people can either go good or bad. At first glance a person may look very nice, but then they turn out being mean or disrespectful. Or you could look at someone that looks mean, but then you realize they are the sweetest person. For example when I went to a new school I didn't know much people, and I looked over at this girl that had a face that made her look mean. I was nervous to go talk to her because I thought she was going to be rude, but turned out she is like a best friend and the nicest person I've ever met. Thats why students shouldn't assume about a person based on looks because they are not always right. But definitely participating in different activities will give students the chance to meet new people.

To come to a conclusion, I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons being they would be more active, meet new people, and be able to find a new hobby. I hope that students become more interested in this decision.
