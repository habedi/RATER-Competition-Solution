Poeple should really join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it could be very fun. I had a lot of fun. If you ever whated to cross the sea's. I cross the Atlantic 16 times and the Pacific 2 times. If you also like long trips this is for you. It takes two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

We got to save a lot of animals too. I got to care for some of the animals, that kept me busy. The had to be fed and watered 3 times a day. Taking care of the animals was very fun. There was also time to have fun on board,especially on our way back when the animals have been unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball games were the animals were staying. We would also have tennis tournaments. With all this it kept us busy and took time and helped past time.

This opportunity was more than amazing. It open the whole world to me. You should try to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
