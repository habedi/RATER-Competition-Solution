Do you think hands free cars are a good idea? They may be, but who knows. Driverless cars aren't going to be fast and easy to make. It takes a lot of time into putting moniters, motion sensors, cameras, and a lot of other technical wiring, but do we really need them?

When driverless cars were first being thought of it was in the 1950's. It was a lot more technical and difficult to do back then, because they didn't have all the major technology we do in todays time. At first they thought of putting special tracks in the roads but realized it would need a lot of money to complete that project.

Later on in the year 2013, BMW came up with the Traffic Jam Assitant. It can only speed up to 25mph, but hey you have to start somewhere. In this car you have to have your hands on the wheel, the cars themselves are fully driverless but they can; steer, accelerate, and break them selves. The cars are specailly made and will notify the driver when they need to take control of the driving, in situations such as navigating around accidents and work zones.

There can be a bit of trouble when it comes to the laws of Driverless cars. It is illegal to test a computer opperated vehical in; California, Nevada, florida, and in the District of Colombia. It is much safer if the driver is in full control and fully aware of everything. There are still new laws being made since everything around us keeps changing.

So in conclusion, Driverless cars should not be made. They arent going to be very well made till years to come. the science behind it all is much more technical then you could imagine. There are a lot of laws that need to be made and modefied in order for people to be able to ride those cars. It is much safer to have a human driver who is wide awake and aware of everything that is going on.
