My principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with what my principal said about how we must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first benefit is students could be forced into something that they actually love. The second thing is students could be really good at something and just not know. And last is kids can get really lazy sometimes and making them do something can make their life a lot better.

First, students could get forced into something they actually love. If a student decides to play a sport for their activity then they could end up really liking it. The students could end up playing that sport for the rest of their life. If they like that sport and keep playing then they could meet new friends. Overall, extracurricular activities can create great experiences.

Second, Students could be really good at something and just not know. Is someone has never played a sport Then they dont know how good they could be at it. I have a friend that had never played basketball And when he first tried the sport it turns out hes good. Any person that tries a new sport could end up playing with the pros, all you have to do is just try the sport. In the end, being forced to do something could reveal a talent.

Lastly, kids can get really lazy at times and by forcing them to do and extracurricular activity can change their life. For instance, if they have weight issues then you could sign them up for a sport so they can loose some of that weight. Also by making them do an activity it can change a persons view on a certain group of people and maybe make them want to do what those people do. By playing something as a kid can make that person as an adult have a stronger work ethic. In conclusion, doing extracurricular activities as a kid can help you as an adult.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities can help find and create good things for you in life. My first example is students could get forced into something that they actually like. Second, kids can be very talented at something and just not know it. And lastly, kids can get really lazy and by forcing them to do these activities can make them into a new person. By making students do extracurricular activities you can help a lot of kids.
