As a very busy person myself forcing us to do at least one extracurricular activity would be absurd. Instead of going home to chill, go outside, spending time with family, or watch TV, students would have to focus on something else? That would stress me out so much to know that I dont just have to worry about homework, but an after school activity as well! These are a lot reasons not to have this rule, but the four that really pushed me to one side are because some students simply dont have the time to actually participate, students might not care enough to do the after school activity rendering it useless to force them to do something they wont do, it would take their mind off of school work alowing their grades to slip, and students need time to take their minds off of school and just chill out.

When I was on the Generic_School soccer team I couldnt keep up with a lot of other things that I did after school like boy scouts. Being on the soccer team meant that when I got home I didnt have enough time to get my homework done and go to scout meetings. Obviously I chose to do homework because

I didnt want to have bad grades. I stopped showing up to meetings until the season was over meaning I couldnt move up a rank, I couldnt see some of my friends, and I didnt learn anything at all about scouting related stuff. Their are students similar to me who would have to give up activities in their lives because they wouldnt have the time to do both.

Students forced to do an after school activity might not even care enough to actually do the activity rendering it useless to force us to participate in an activity that most of us probably wont do in the first place. If you put this rule into effect get ready for some backlash. Students are already under enough stress as it is, in fact I am under a mountain of stress now writing this. Don't add on to it and give students more reason to hate school, because at the end of the day we still like to go home and relieve that stress thats cooped up inside of us thats making our lives miserable. I know at least 50 people who wouldnt even go to their after school activity so there wouldnt be a point in even trying to get them to do it, that would be like trying to get a cat to sit on command, you can try but sure as heck your going to fail.

If you put that rule in affect that will take students focus away from school and school work and put it on that activity. Students wouldnt have time to do homework, and trust me when I say that multiple zeros on homework assignments can build up and really do some damage to your grades. Isnt it one of your main focuses to help students get good grades, so taking our focus away from school allowing our grades to slip is going against your own morals.

This dosent just apply to students, but to every body who has a job as well. At the end of a long day at school or work, dont you want to go home and after doing homework, you just want to chill or just get your mind off the stress that we all have to deal with. Depriving us of that is like depriving us of sleep, because as a human being every body needs a stress reliever at some point. Nobody wants to have to deal with the amount of stress that school just throws on you. We need some time to get all of that stress out, instead of you throwing yet another weight on our shoulders. We need downtime, everybody dose, even god made an entire day for resting! So dont deprive students of that freedom that we all need to stay sane.

In conclusion we shouldnt be forced to do an after school activity because students simply dont have the time and adding another thing to that schedule wouldnt help, a lot of students will not care at all to be forced to have an after school activity and might not even come, it would get their focus off school work allowing their grades to slip, and after doing homework students like to get their minds off of school and chill. I hope you consider all of these reasons and make the best option and dont force students to do after school activities.
