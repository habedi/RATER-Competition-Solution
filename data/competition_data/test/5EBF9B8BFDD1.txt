In movie's robots are shown to have less emotion then a brick. However what if we could change that and make them not only capable of expressing emotion, but also reading it! That is why I am for this idea, this is easily the next step to creating a robot that acts like a human! The sheer amount of other possible uses are nearly endless!

Tired of watching and seeing the same add you don't like? This can fix the problem! the platform running the video (for example, youtube) could find out how much you liked the add before and after, using this information, they can write an algorithem to see what ads you like and don't like and see. Running a school filled with computers? Have the lesson teach itself by keeping the student entertained! As said by dr. Huang "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor".

Hospitals could use emotion to check how a patient is feeling. if they're sad the camera will tell them. are they in pain? the camera can tell them. The knowledge of emotion just by seeing the patient's face in a camera reduces the need for nurses and allows a hospitel to hold more patients. maybe in the far future, we could have medical assistants, like baymax from big hero six, who could act as an automated doctor or nurse. need an example? in december of 2017 the flu broke out killing more then 500 people, if hospitals would've had more room, it could saved 80% of the people who died from the flu that year.

The sheer amount of uses are too vast! Ads could finnally maintain revelancy. Teachers could be replaced by good programmers, hospitals could save more lives than ever! I feel that the downsides, if any, Are complete obsolete when compared to the upside. I think we all should focus on the study of emotion and learn how much it can help.
