I feel this is a good thing,because the kids could get in shape or learn a new skill that could also make people stronger. So then the clinic in the school could have less people in there as well. On the bad side it could mean less family time, less sleep, and less or stuff you enjoy and are not forced to do. The principal might have done that to make the school look better or for the kids to be better at a variety of things. Also the principal could have done that because the sports there dont have enough players. The kids could have one of two responses to the decision the principal made. They could be mad at the principal because they want to go home right after school and rest all evening. And be able to do something there not forced to do. They could also be happy because there parents might not have let them play sports and now its requied so they can now play a sport. Or help with the yearbook after school. The sports players are probably happy about the decision the principal made. Because they can now have a full team and probably extra people to and they would actually be able to play a season because they have a full team.

Overall i feel like its not that bad of a decision from the principal depending on what the reason he did that was for. If the principal did it for the school to look better and get money back then i dont agree with the principal at all,because there are other ways of getting money and making the school look better without forcing the kids to do something some off them may not like. And risking losing kids from your school,If the pricipal did it for the kids to get in shape and learn a variety of different skills. Then yes i agree with him 100 percent because that could cut the amount of people going to the clinic and varies things like that,which means kids are missing less class time to go to the clinic. The parents will most likely have one of the two same responses as the kids and some might even move there familys to a new school due to the decision the principal made. Some of the kids may even not play nor do what there told because it is a demamded thing from the principal you cant just get kicked out and do something else. The principal might change it do to what the outcome of the principal forcing that is .If alot of people leave due to the principal forcing that then. The principal will most likely get rid of it but if very few people leave and some new kids come then he most likely isnt gonna get rid of it.
