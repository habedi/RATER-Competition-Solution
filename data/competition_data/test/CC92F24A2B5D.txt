Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally do not think that we should have to do community service, but be able to choose rather or not we would like to do community service. Community service can be a good thing for all of us and our community, but it can also be something that some kids might not like doing. For instance you could be painting graffiti when you do not like the smell of paint. Some people do not like parks and half to clean park, or even cleaning other people trash when they loiter. people that loiter should get caught so other people do not have to clean it up.

Even though most people think there should be more volunteers for community service that is not necessarily true. Most adults say they with there were more volunteers but if that were true wouldn't they get up and do it they're self instead of trying to wish there were young kids doing it for them. If adults want it done they should get up and do it like they want us to do for them so they don't have to break a sweat like they want us to do.

So all i am trying to say is that kids should not have to do community service but they should be able to choose rather they want to do community service or not.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
