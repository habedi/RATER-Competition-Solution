My name is Luke Bomberger and I want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. When you join you can help different countries and their people. And you can see marvolous sights such as, Europe, China, Italy, and Greece. Also, when going home you can play games like Table-tennis tournaments, boxing, and fencing.

Another reason you shouldjoin the Seagoing Cowboys are the animals. You can feed the animals, water them and, make sure they aren't hurt. You'd be helping people too, by bring people livestock and food to eat. And for all your hard work, on the return trip you can play games, read, or do some whittling. I know all of this because I'm part of the Seagoing Cowboys crew.

In conclusion, if you join, you help people, be with some animals, play some games, see Beautiful sights onboard, and you'd be helping the military. So, be part of the Seagoing Cowboys crew today!
