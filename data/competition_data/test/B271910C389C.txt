Did you know about 25 years ago a funny face has appeared on Mars? Did you also know that the funny face became a pop icon? The funny face has appeared on lots of things. It became popular after the scientists and researchers found out about it. It went on tv shows, movies, magazines, and stuff like that.

Some scientist think that it was some kind of alien artifact, even though aliens do not exist. Some of the scientists or the Mars Orbiter Camera took a lot of pictures to get a really good picture of it. The scientists did this because they wanted to be able to study a lot better and they would get a better view of the face, if they get a really good picture of it. It took a while for them to get the picture on this JPL web site. It turns out that the face was not an alien's artifact after all.

The scientists wanted to get another picture of the face on Mars. They wanted to have a second look at it, to make sure that can get the right information on it. Like where the face is, what degrees it is at, which it is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. They wanted to find good information about it. They wanted to get better pictures of it so they could study it more, so they could get research on it.

Some people think that the face on Mars looks equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform commom around the American West. So now people know what it looks like. Some people might think it still looks like a face to them but other people might not think that anymore. They think it looks different now that the scientists figured out what it looks like. The scientists figured out that the lava dome, isolated the form mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The scientists might still be trying to figure out how this face appeared on Mars how it got there. Some people are trying to figure out what the face looks like, even some people think that the face on Mars doesn't even look like a face. Scientists might look at this differently now. They might as well keep trying to figure it out if they want to.
