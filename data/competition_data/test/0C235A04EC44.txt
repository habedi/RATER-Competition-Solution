To be honest I think that students should at least be in one extracurricular activity because you can meet other people, you can learn more stuff on the thing your doing, and you can find something that fits you. People could disagree with me, but I can explain why its better to be in an after school activity. There could be reasons on why its better to not be in one and people might not want to be in one, but I just think its better to be in one. There is more reasons, but I just listed those three reasons and there could be a lot more.

First, you can meet new people and have new friends. For example if you play a sport you will have teammates and you will become friends with them, because you will have to talk if you want to do good in games. Also it is good to have new friends, because you can get really close with them and be friends for a long time. There could be really cool people that you meet and it would be fun if you made a friend who is nice. That is one reason why you should be in a after school activity.

Secondly, is that you will learn more stuff and be better at the thing you're doing. For instance if you are working on a yearbook you are drawing and you can get better at drawing and become a really good artist. Another example is playing a sport, if you are playing a sport you will become good if you play a lot and practice then it will be even more fun if you are good. There is a lot of after school activities so you have a lot of options to do like the sports are flag football, basketball, and soccer so you could be good at all those things and it will be really fun for you. That is the second reason you should be in a after school activity.

Finally, is that you can find something that fits you, because there is so many options like I said before. What I mean by this is you can find something really fun that you enjoy and you could do it for the rest of your life. If you find something that you enjoy a lot you will have fun and have a happy life. Like if you find a sport you really like then you can maybe play in a real team and then you play in the future. Or if you wanna do the yearbook which you draw you can become an artist and in the future you can sell your paintings or just keep them for decorations. Also you can have a chance of being famous if you are really good at something like be in nba for basketball and or be a popular artist. That was my third reason that you should be in a after school activity.

In conclusion, being able to make new friends, learn more about the stuff your doing while getting being better at it, and find something that fits you are my three reasons that you should have to do a after school activity. Yet, there is way more reasons then just three, but I just stated those three reasons. Hopefully that changed your mind if you thought everyone shouldn't have to be in a extracurricular activity. So I do agree with the principal that everyone should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.
