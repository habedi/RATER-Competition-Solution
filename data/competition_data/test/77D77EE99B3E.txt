School is a place of learning. It can also be a place to get to know new people. But school lacks student participation in after school activities. Our principle has decided that all students should participate in at least one after school activity. The reason why students should participate in an after school activity is sports, students council, and the yearbook.

The first reason why students should participate in an after is sports. Sports is a great way for the school to be recognized by colleges. Scouts from colleges will want to come to our games to draft kids into their college. Sports will also get the school trophies for students to brag about. Because of all of the trophies the other school sport teams will recognize the school as an actual challenge to go against.

The second reason why students should participate in an after school activity is the student council. The student council can encourage the school to do more fun activities for the students. The students council represents the students, so the students will be able to have a voice. Therefore the council will know what to focus on for the schools.

The final reason why students should participate in after school activities is the year book. Having students as photographer will mean they will take decent pictures. With a lot of students in the yearbook club there will be many pictures to pick from. The yearbook club will make sure students will have memories of the school.

The reason why schools should participate in an after school activity is sports, student council, and yearbook. Sports will help students get recognized by scouts, the sport team will be an actual challenge to beat, and the school will have a lot of trophies. The student council will try to get more fun activities, students will have a voice, the student council will know what to focus on. The yearbook will get students to take good pictures, because of the number of students the yearbook club will have a lot of pictures to choose from, the yearbook club will make sure the students will have memories of the year they had at school. The school needs more participation from the students. With a lot of people participating in after school activities it can make the school a more fun place.
