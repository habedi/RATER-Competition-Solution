Have you ever wonder what would be in the Acropolis? Well if you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboy Program, you can! Us cowboys travel all over the world to see amazing structures and sights of wonder. My favorite is riding the Panama Canal to China.

One can achive information that they did not know. We have seen and experience many sights of wonders, such as riding a gondola in Venice, Italy, we have toured a excavated city in Crete, and marveled the Panama Canal to China. These sights were amazing to see and experience. One should sign up so that they can do adventures that they may not be able to do in their area.

There are some down sides though. It takes a while to get to these resort, but it is worth it. It took us about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean to reach China. On our ship we have many objectives to keep ourselves busy; including: feeding our animals, night guarding, and cleaning stalls. One day when we returned the animals, we played volleyball and baseball in the empty stalls.

I would recommend joining the Seagoing Cowboys, because of these reasons: to visit resorts and do adventures that one may not be able to do. The Seagoing Cowboys Program has been going on for sometime now, and I myself, want to keep it going. Sign up today!
