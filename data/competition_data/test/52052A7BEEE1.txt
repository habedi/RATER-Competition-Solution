I think this should be a teacher design because, they should challenge students ,and teach us a way to never stop learning no matter where you are.

Monday 9th,2006 Generic_Name teacher assigned a project to her and her friends and that it should be done by the end of the break. Generic_Name asked Generic_Name well why do we have to do a project over break thats not right, that should be our relax time .Mr. Generic_Name,the teacher, came in the conversation and said, even though your on break you should never stop learning or challenging yourself no matter where you are.

Some people think that school is hard work and to much , However, its not because no matter where you are you will always need education. Challenging your self is a good thing because putting in hard work and efforts can improve your learning.

I think this would be a great idea because students can learn more things and challenge there selves instead of having fun on the beach, or jumping off buildings.

Now that Your now that this should be a teachers design you should get ready to assign more projects over the breaks.
