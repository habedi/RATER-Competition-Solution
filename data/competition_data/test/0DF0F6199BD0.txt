Learning is an experienece that will follow you where ever you go. A key element of learning is the ablity to retain the information. The three months that students are given during the summer break shouldn't be completely wasted. It is easy to sit back and forget everything you've dedicated your nine months in school to. This is why a teacher-designed summer project is crucial. These summer projects help student's retain the information and get them ready for their classes next year. Summer projects should always be teacher designed that way the information is effective and reliable. A student designed project won't be as effective as a teacher designed project due to the their excitement towards summer break. Student's will always find an easy way out of things and that is why a teacher is there, to maintain authority and educate! I believe that mandatory summer projects should always be teacher designed so that student's get the best and effective education.

Summer break is definetly a time for students to relax and find peace from school. That dosen't mean that you should forget school completely until the first day comes around. Many students struggle on the first semester because they are not mentally and physically prepared. Summer projects are sort of like the student's wake up call for the soon to come school year. Proper preparation is important for anything, especially if it reflects on your future. Starting your high school year strong is fundamental to maintaning your grades throughout the school year. An effective summer project can help get to you ready for your classes and keep the ball rolling. A teacher designed project will help prepare you for the school year but will also balance the "fun" part of it. A student-designed project will be more fun and then actual learning. A teacher can effectivly design a project that can balance both the fun and the learning part so that student's can get the best of both worlds. Nevertheless, if your required to do a summer project, it might as well be helpful to your learning. At the end of the day, it's about mind over matter.

Many students don't realize how important high school actually is to your future. I mean, they are still young and need guidence. Which is why they shouldn't design the project that they ultimately have to complete. Students only come into class for a grade and not actually to learn. Student's will take any chance they have to improve their grade. This is why a student-designed project is not the best benificial to their own good. Kids precieve school as somewhere they have to be and that's completely normal. No one actually wants to go out and learn, which is why teachers are there to help. They teach and educate students while keeping an engaging enviorment. Teacher's have been students once and know what they have to do to balance fun with work. Summer should be a time for relaxation and preperation.

Many will argue that if students are required to do an assignment then why can't they design it? I mean, they are required to be at school! Plus, this is their break time so aren't they entitled to it? This all stems down to what is best for the students. If it were up to the students, they wouldn't even put a summer assignment! Or homework for that case. At the end of the day, its benificial to the students and will only help them. Teacher can find the balance between fun and work, where as students would be all fun and no work. Summer projects should be a refresher and a tool to prepare! Not an easy grade.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are far more benificial to students then student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects are proper and will help prepare students for next year. Teacher's were students once and know how to properly balance the project for the best of both worlds. Student's don't know what's best for them and lack expierence. The essential part about learning is to retain and use the information to benifet you. Teacher's want to see the best for them and see them suceed. Education will be apart of everyone's life and they have to learn to accept it. Your grades will impact your future and should be taken seriously. Proper preparation will help keep students to maintan good grades. At the end of the day, it comes down to hard work and hard work brings results.
