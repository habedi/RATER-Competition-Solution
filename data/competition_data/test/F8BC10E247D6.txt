"The evening star" venus, is one of the brightest points in the sky. Venus is the second planet away from the sun. Venus can be reffered to as earth's twin because of size and distance from eachother. Earth, Venus, and Mars are the closest to eachother. There can possibly be life on Mars but not really on venus.

Venus' temperature is really really hot which means there is automaticly no possible life on Venus. The text states "on planet's surface temperatures average 800 degrees faranheit". This let's me know that there is no possible life Venus. The text also states that "Venus has the most hottest temperature on surface than any other planet". That is another reason why,but it states in the text that it is 180 degrees farenheit when you are 30 miles plus away from venus. I don't think we can resist that type of temperature either, but it says that we can but hardly.

The atmospheric pressure of venus is also crazy. The text states that "the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience". This let's me know that if try and go into the atmosphere, we would automatically explode. Many erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting happen in Venus as well. Even though mercury is closer to the sun, Venus still has the hottest temperature o surface.

Scientists are still trying to study Venus to see if we can have a chance. You're probably thinking that if the planet is literally unable to live in, why still do visits? Well it states in the passage that "it once was the most earthlike planet on our solar sytem". The reason for this is because long ago, Venus was covered in oceans and could have supported various life forms. Scientist are really crazy for that and if they do send out people to study and stuff, they're just letting people die. The reason I say this is because the temperature and atmospheric pressure is insane.

Personally I think that it is not a worthy pursuit to go travel to Venus and perform a few studies. You literally can die while going over there and if the person dies, how are you supposed to know the studies they performed. Honestly I wouldn't do it, but NASA does pay a lot of money, But what's more important, getting the money and have a possible chance of dying or just be safe and sound? Personally I would chose to be safe and sound because one, outer space doesn't really draw my attention. The second one is I would like to be safe and not go through that experience. Now which one would you choose?
