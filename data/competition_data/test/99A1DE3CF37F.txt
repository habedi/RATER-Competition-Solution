Students are going home everyday having nothing to do, therefore some of them turn to hang out with the wrong crowd, with the wrong people. Some turn to drugs, while others turn to alcohol. If only they had something to do after school, then they wouldn't do things like drugs and alcohol. That is why every student must participate in an extracurricular activity. While every student should do an extracurricular activity, the school has to provide multiple after school activities so that students have options to pick from. All students should participate in extracurricular activities because it gives students the feel of school pride when their school goes into a competition, it takes up time in a students day so they don't have to go do drugs and alcohol, and it surrounds a students with a good environment.

When students are involved in school, they participate in more school events like football games, school parties, and theater productions. Not only are the students more involved, but their friends are too. Most kids don't like to go to school events by themselves, so they bring a friend. If every student brings at least one friend, then the amount of people that goes to the events doubles. Just last year I was on my middle school basketball team and we were playing a team that we were rivals with. I wanted my friends to see and watch me play, so I brought at least twenty people to the game. When people are involved in something, they want their friends to see what they have done, and they want to be praised. The students may not enjoy being forced to stay after school at first, but they will soon learn to love it.

Some students go home to an empty house, for their parents come home late at night because they are working. With nothing to do they start to watch shows and movies, but they get bored and tired of watching TV shows after a while. When somebody is bored, they look for anything to cure their boredom. Some turn to friends, while others turn to drugs and alcohol. If they drink enough, they get drunk and do things without knowing they did it. This kills time a lot faster than sitting around doing nothing all day. Drugs can be worse because the consequences can be a lot more serious. Some consequences are liver failure and death. Both are also very expensive and addictive, so it makes the people taking it want to take one more dose, drink one more cup, until they no longer have any money because they spent it all on drugs and alcohol. Their school could have prevented all of this if the student just stayed after school for a little longer. If the students stayed after school for the yearbook committee, they would not have the time to be bored because they would be too busy creating a yearbook for the whole school to see. When students stay after school for extracurricular activities they do not need to turn to drugs because they are busy at school. The school also fills the students with a good environment, which leads me to my next topic.

A child acts and does things similar to the people they hang out with. If their friends are people that do a lot of community services and are nice people, the child will turn out to be nice too. This does not just apply to children, but it applies to everybody. Sometimes a good environment can be hard to find, but what better place sets a good environment than a school. A school has teachers that are willing to support their students and give them good guidance. Whenever I have a question with friends or anything, I have this one teacher that I know I can trust. This teacher helps and guides me with whatever my problem is. Everybody can find that one teacher they can trust if they joined an extracurricular activity. They could bond and connect with the teacher that is helping out at the activity, and they could find a good influence similar to the one I have.

Participating in an extracurricular activity helps and benefits students in many ways, and when students are ever looking for something to do, they don't have to turn to drugs, they could turn to after school activities which gives them a good and positive learning environment and it gives students the urge to participate and attend school games and parties. School may not be a students favorite place to be, but it provides students with a safe place that can have fun activities like soccer club or basketball club. Some students might complain about the new policy, but once they change their mindset, they will learn to love and enjoy the new rule. Not only are they staying in a safe environment, they are also hanging out with their friends outside of school hours. This time would also be a great time for students with no friends to take a chance and try to make some. Since extracurricular activities are fun and it provides a good and safe environment, making it mandatory it something I agree with and I think is right.
