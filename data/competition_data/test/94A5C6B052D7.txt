I would disagree with the principals idea because some people might not have enough time and trouble the parents with their schedule . Or a person just doesn't want to do any of the activities, theres would be nothing interesting for them to do. It would be a waste of time and money for the teachers who want to teach but the kids are just not into it and the waste of money on the sports. It would be best to let them decide what activity they should do and not make it mandatory.

Students may have their own plans they planned ahead but then they get suddenly told that they must do one extracurricular activity for school and dont have time for it . It would disturb the student schedule and the parents plans for their kid! For example the parents have an appointment for a future date. Then get a email that their daughter signed up for soccer and the team meets on the same day the parents had their kids appointment for. They would have to change everything and make a new appointment and it can take a long time. Or their kid stays after but theres no late buses on that day and both parents are working and can't pick them up. What would they do then? It would be just a hassle for both the student or parents.

Whats would happen if only a few students or too many join? It would cause a lot of problems for the school to deal with. Like If only two students join basketball, what would they do? They can't play with only two so they would have to disband. But then if one activity is full and a bunch of people want to only join that activity it would cause headaches for the staff and teachers. Also what would happen if a bunch of people have no interest in any of them, you cant force them so you really wouldn't have control of the situation at hand. So it wouldn't really even work if theres going to be so many problems.

It would also be a waste of time for the teachers or coaches if your going to make it official. For the students who do pick something but have no interest in it , it be a waste of time for the teachers teaching. They would just not listen or do anything. So why should the teachers have to teach them when they could teach the actual kids who might want to learn? For the kid who just signed up for the sake of it being mandatory, they could be having other plans for studying or spending time with their family. Also it would be especially bad if a student signs up for a sport and does nothing to help out. It would be bad for the actual kids who want to play and the whole team , then the money spent into the activities. It would just be a waste of time,money and effort put into the whole thing.

So I would definitely disagree with the idea of the mandatory extracurricular activities because of the hassle for the parents, the non interest and waste in time. It would just be horrible and trouble for the whole school, and we wouldn't want that. We should just stick with what the students want to do and let them pick what they want and let them have fun.
