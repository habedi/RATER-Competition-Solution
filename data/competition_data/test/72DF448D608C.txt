Think about your school or schools you've attended. There's probably an amazing sports team, artistic art club, creative yearbook squad, or a motivating student council. What if none of that ever existed? Kids would be mortified by their own boredom! They wouldn't be healthy, and wouldn't know how to do awesome things on their own; or have pride in themselves. Here's why I think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I believe that all young people must be "healthy and happy". Having decent to well mental health is just as important as physical, and sports or clubs really pay off for that! If students join a sports team, their bodies will stay healthy, and staying active lowers chances of getting heart diseases and being overweight or obese. Even mentally and emotionally, they have something to depend on. Sports also reduce stress as well, so that can help with teenagers life drastically. Other things then sports can keep you in great shape inside and out, but physical activity may help the most.

Having pride, knowledge and opportunity can get you many places in life. Jobs, colleges, special schools, and a lot of others. For example, working for the yearbook. Knowing how to take pictures, working with computers cameras and other technology can boost your knowledge in daily life. If students join clubs or teams that have talent in something, they will begin to learn from it. Even in student counseling: If kids or teens participate in it, they have pride in themselves and are more confident in who they are. They would know they're good at what they're doing.

Colleges, or private schools often reach out to give athletic scholarships and more, because the individual does the activity well.

Participating in extracurricular activities gives you something to do! You can avoid being bored. Humans think in the extracurricular activies and it stimulates the brain to do more. Instead of sitting and scrolling through your phone, watching videos on your computer, or walking around in cirlces... Students can actually come up with ideas or exercise alone or together. Students can teach other students what their great at. Boredom can easily overtake teenagers to do nothing and be less active. Physical activity or problem solving and creativity can piece together to solve that.

I think all students should participate in at least one extra curricular activity because they can help you be healthy, physically (reducing chances of getting heart diseases and avoiding obesity) and mentally (it may calm stress and anxiety). Another reason why is lacking confidence, pride, and knowledge can make daily life hard! Extracurricular activies may help with that; you can learn a lot from the activity. The last point is it cures boredom! Students can do things that won't make them bored and they have passion in it. Us students can't handle not having something to do, let's help this!Â
