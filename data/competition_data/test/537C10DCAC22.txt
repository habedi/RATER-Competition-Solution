To me the object does look like a face. But to me it also looks like a bunch of rocks put together and the about to break apart. Also the face is a natural landform that probably was built by water and and dirt. That formed over the year and got so hard that now its starting to crack and form a object that looks like a face.

In the article it says "twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars". So that makes me think that rocks or dirt builded up and now starting the crack. On Mars there' s a bunch of rock and dirt. But also the article said "A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see". "The caption noted a "huge rock formatoin which resembles a human head".

My conclusion is that somebody will find out what it is. But also find out the cause of it and what harm can it do. Not only that but whatg do it stand for and why is it just now happening after all these years that has passed by. But this is my conclusion for this article here today.
