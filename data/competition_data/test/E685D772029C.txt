We would have prefer converting the Electoral College into a election by popular vote for the president of United States of America. There are sevral reasons why. We the voters don't really vote for the president we vote for a slate electors. If this electoral college system is still in use if you vote a president and your state consisted of 25 Democratic electors then Congress and the President will get 25 electoral votes. "...those electors could always defy the will of the peopl." (Source 2). This is absolutly wrong we the voters should defy our own use of will to which of any president we desire. By changing the Electoral College into a election by popular vote we can as well desire which president to proceed on voting, with any of the electors defying our will.

"...representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as mush say as the 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 million voters."(source 2). This system of Electrol College gives no one vote there potential power of use. Even putting that many votes to just single only party for President and Congress, House's selesction will barely and im sure wouldnt even be expected to give any will to any one people. We the voters dont have as much power, "when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888."(source 3). Yet there are still more votes then the electoral votes the one that had more electoral votes and won, ffrom this there is not as much use of power on our votes, that is if the electoral wish to use to his own use, so why keep on having the Electoral College.

"Most states have a "winner takes all" system"...(source 1), this will reward any electoral, if they chose to the president that won of course. In the toss-up states voters tend to look closely in the campaign, these are the "most thoughtful" voters, it should actually be every voter but no its not, not even the ones who will be deciding the election. This is why i do not proceed on still having a Electoral College and changing it into a election by popular vote.
