Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you about the suggestion on the new school policy that if anyone who would like to participate in sports or any other activities must have at least a B average and how its is not fair.

First off I would like to state that the policy about the B average is not right. Most of the kids here are lucky enough to get at least a C average. If you change the policy where we can only have a B to play sports then there wont be a whole lot of people playing. I like the old policy better cause then I have a chance to play any sports if I wanted to. Plus, if you keep things the same it would make everyone more happy.

Right now, everyone is worrying about there grades. Some of the have a hard time doing the work and the are lucky just to get there grade to keep them passing. this they know that there passing. if you change the policy, people will get confused and worry that they are not going on to the next grade and then there would a total panic around the school just because the think there not passing. So I think that the school policy should stay the same.

Please think about what you are doing before change anything.

Sincerely,
