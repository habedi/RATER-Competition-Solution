Principal,

I believe that you should not allow kids to have pones in school because students will get distracted in school.

Even though students will only be allowed to use their phones in their free time in school, I believe that they still will use them when they are not supposed to.

I also believe students will say that they are done with their work just so they can use their phones to text and communicate with their friends.

If their phones are in their lockers turned off then they cant use them and will not be able to get distracted by other students with their cell phones and will not be tempted to text their friends.

Students may also have games on their phones so if they have them in their pockets then they will have them in class and most students are not guaranteed to have their phones turned off so they will most likely play games and not focus on work.

These are some of the reasons why I believe students should not be able to use their phones in their free time at school.
