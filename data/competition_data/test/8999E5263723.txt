Dear, Principal

I think you should let us students perform community service because our environment needs to get cleaner. Many students and adults litter every where in schools, parks, parking lots, and even on the streets where people walk. That is not only bad for the environment but it is also nasty for our district. If we litter less we wouldn't have this problem but some people don't understand. Some states in America have made laws about littering. If you litter you get a fee and a court date. So in order to make our streets look cleaner and make our air cleaner to we should do community service. Picking up trash is not the only way to do community service we can also help in an animal shelter or in a nursing home.

Besides picking up trash or helping out in animal shelters we can also help kids. We can help kids realize not to litter and we can also show them to help people or animals in need. There is also a good thing about this plan because if kids our helping clean out the streets they wont be doing bad things somewhere else so they'll be doing something helpful and not getting in trouble. Many kids at there teenage age start doing bad things some because they think its cool others because they fall into peer pressure. Some of these bad things are drugs, alcohol, and vandalism. We can also go and talk to the old people in the nursing homes who don't have company or relatives to visit them. We can stay with them for at least once a week and play games with them or tell stories with them. That is what I think we should do because it not only helps the environment but it can also keep kids who do make bad choices stay out of jail.
