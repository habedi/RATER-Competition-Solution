dear principal i believe students should be able to have cell phones at school but shouldn't be able to use them during class. i believe students should have cell phones because if they forgot something at home they could call home and get ti dropped off, if there is an emergency you can call home to get picked up, and if school is canceled u can call home to get a ride or ask permission to hang out with friends.

students like me are forgetful. i have forgotten a lot of stuff at home that i needed for class or for an after school activities. if students had cell phones at lunch and free time they could call there parent and ask them to drop off whatever they forgot at home.

imagine that the school had a fire. how would you call your parents to tell them to pick you up. they probably wouldn't of even known until they came to pick you up. that is another reason students should have cell phones. if there is a fire or a natural disaster they could call home to get a ride.

imagine going to school on a Friday and getting there and finding out it was closed. if that was me i would be to lazy to walk back home, but i wouldn't have my cell phone because were not aloud to have them in school. if we had cell phones i could have called home and got a ride instead of having to walk back home.

i still believe students should be able to have phones in school. if they did they would be able to call home if they forgot something, be able to call home if something happened to the school, or they would be able to call home if school was canceled. these are the three reasons why i think that schools should let students have phones in school.

sincerely
