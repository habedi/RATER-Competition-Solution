I think it should be designed by teachers. The reason why it should be teachers designed, is that if the students need help on the project the teachers would know how to help.

Teachers help students a lot with providing information that they need to complete their assignments. There was this one times my friend Generic_Name needed help on his projects he kept over thinking that he had to much,or that it might not be enough. But when he ask the teacher for assistants Mr Generic_Name help show him the things that he needed,and don't need. Once Mr Generic_Name showed him Generic_Name felt better about his project

Teachers have more knowledge than students. To became a teacher you have to go to college and get your degree. And they have already went through the process,of being a students in school. For and example my Grandmother used to all ways tell me I didn't know more than her because she have been living on these earth more than me and she was right because I haven't. She have been a students before she had to do same things I have to do.

The reason why it shouldn't be a student designed is because most kids now a day just copy and paste anything from google and don't put no thought into hard working

That's why you should pick teachers design they have more knowledge and training.
