I think that we should be able to have cell phones during lunch.

nd between passing hours. The only thing we should be able to do, is to text, because if we call, we might be too loud.

Another i think that we should only text, is because when you text it's not disturbing anybody.

So leads me to policy number one.

I agree on policy number two also, it's just that i like the choice of policy number one.

On the other hand, if we do get to text during passing minutes and lunch time, when we return to class we should stay on task.

For example: not bring the conversation in class, and share it with your friends or make the teacher angry, because of what you caused.

when we would have to turn the cell phones off, i think that we should keep them in our lockers, and turn them off as well.

If a teacher sees a student with their phone with them, i think that the student should get in trouble, because we've been told to leave the cell phones in our locker and keep them off.

The reason for us having them off is so that if the student forgets to put their phone on vibrate, and someone calls them , or text them, and their locker is by a class room, then you can hear their cell phone go off and it will disturb the whole class.

That's why i chose policy number one.
