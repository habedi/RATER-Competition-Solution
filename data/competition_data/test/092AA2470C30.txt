So a letter to my state senator into keeping the Electoral College, Well the Electoral College is a proccess not a place, Its basically a comproisme between the election for the President by the vote of congress. Also it was founding by the fathers and it was established in the Constitution. After That, A consists of 538 electors and majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President our state's entitled allotment of electoral equals the number of members in its Congressional.

To Begin With, Even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong , what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole do, well let me tell you the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in thier time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!. Also over 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. whats wrong with the electoral college, Well under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president , but a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Before That, For example if you lived in texas and you wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic Electors pledged to Kerry. Also state conventions, And the state party's central committee, also the presidental candidates themesleves can voters ever contoral whom they are voting for answer not always. After That, 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature Nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Well Its agreed that the electoral college is unfair,outdated, and irrational. the best arguments in favor of it are mostly asstertionsÂ  without much basis in reality.

Finally, We can argue that Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying thier states- Demoracts in texas, for example, or Repiblicans in California, knowing that thier vote will have no effect what so ever...
