Dear principal,

Students in every day life go to school and use their cell phones. It may be during class or in between. The students have been sneaking it around because it is not allowed. This shouldn't go on for long. It's time to put a stop to it. Students are more focused on the phones and not their work. They are also focused on not getting caught by and adult staff, such as the teacher or the principal, etc. Therefore the policy I consider would be a good idea would be Policy 1. This is all because they don't get the time to use their phones at school. The Policy I consider would be Policy 1 to be the most reasonable for this situation.

I consider Policy 2 to be the most reasonable for this occasion because it allows students to know that they have time to have use of their phones at a certain time during school. It is a good idea because then students probably would not get so distracted. Since students are hiding their phones during class they don't do their work because that is what their focused on. In my opinion mobile phones is one of the technology used. Therefore texting is one of the most things teens now a days do. During any time period of the day. I think that if students were actually given a chance they would stop doing the wrong things and pay more attention in class. Policy 2 would probably be the best choice. It sure is a choice i recommend. It's only allowed during lunch periods and during free times. Not during class, they shall be checked when entering the classed room for the phones to be turned off.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
