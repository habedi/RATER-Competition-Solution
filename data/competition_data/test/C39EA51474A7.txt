I think while driving you should not be able to use your phones because that can cause accidents.

Mobile phone use while driving is common but it can be very dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashing . in addition to voice calling , activities such as texting while driving , playing video games , or just basic phone use can still cause crashes.

In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones

In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. In a number of cases it has been shown that bans on mobile use while driving have proven to be an effective way to deter people from picking up their phones. Those violating the ban usually face fines and points on their licence. Although an initial decrease/alteration in driving habits is to be expected. As time goes on the number of people breaking these laws/regulations eventually goes back to normal, sometimes higher levels as time goes on and people go back to their old habits. In addition, police officers have difficulties detecting mobile phone use in vehicles, which decreases the effectiveness of bans/restrictions on mobile phone.

However, the hands free rule really isn't safe either because that can still cost a crash. Now to summarize this all i think having phones while driving isn't safe.
