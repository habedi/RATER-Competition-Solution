Time and time again, it has been proven that students are more likely to demonstrate an engaged focus when studying topics they have a genuine interest in. For example, elective classes often garner the most frequent acts of student initiative in a variety of academic fields. This is because students have been given the opportunity to explore their own personal interests and have found academic work that feels like an interest rather than a chore. Dedicated study can only truly be achieved once a student feels they have a strong connection to their own work. If schools wish to continue learning throughout summer break, they must allow students to pursue something they will actually find interest in. Student-designed projects are the most reliable option in achieving the desired result of continued learning outside the classroom as they encourage initiative, support individuality, and can be more applicable to students' futures.

Some of the more prominent examples of student initiative in high schools are elective classes and club programs. For example, at Generic_School, many of the elective classes and extracurricular groups have found prosperity through encouragement of student initiative. The school magazine,

Inside15000, has won numerous awards over the years for both design and content. Similarly, the robotics team has received recognition globally for their outreach efforts in spreading the love of STEM to their local community. It is important to note that the main similarity between these groups is their student initiative. The magazine is run by student editors and student staff members, and Robotic's outreach is comprised of hired and elected student leaders. Students in these organizations work year round on academically oriented work that is not graded or assessed. Without the explicit demand of an educator, students are able to pursue ventures in a new way. They are able to create a completely student-designed feat of success. Thus, solidifying the notion that when given the opportunity to create and explore on their own, students take initiative.

Another reason to rely on student-designed projects is their ability to support individuality. Colleges, employers, and leaders alike all look for the individual that sticks out. In life, one of the best things a person can do is be his or her own self. When applying to a job or college in the future, students may be forced to answer the question asked on almost all applications. Why should that individual be considered over or set apart from their peers? If these students have not been given ample opportunity to develop individualistic qualities, they may have their efforts hindered in the future. Summer projects should be used to enhance learning, but also the student as a whole. Having the opportunity to design their own project would provide students with vital opportunity and adversity which can aid them in establishing themselves later in life. Adversity and opportunity lead to advanced character and innovation. Without which, students may never reach their optimal performance or status.

Although character is necessary in later life, specified education is equally as important, if not more so. Allowing students to focus allotted academic time on a topic they wish to pursue in later life is the most practical application of a summer break project. In Ireland secondary school students are required to complete a year of work experience through their school. The intended purpose is to help prepare students for their desired field of work. During a scheduled period of school time, students are able to engage in a myriad of opportunities including internships, seminars, and apprenticeships. It is, however, still important to consider major differences between the Irish school system and the American one when assessing its merit. Though the work experience system is not a currently realistic implication for American students, pursuing endeavors related to their desired future careers can be. One way of allowing for such endeavors is through student-designed projects. Students would be able to dedicate their time and energy into learning something, not purely for the educational value, but for the real world application as well.

There are many reasons to implement student-designed summer projects. All of the aforementioned reasons would consequently contribute to a more well-rounded student. Ultimately, students will create a more unique and well developed project once they are engaged in the subject matter. Therefore, students should most definitely be responsible for designing their own summer break projects. Students should be given the chance to take initiative and explore their own uniqueness. They should also be allowed to pursue knowledge that will eventually make them a profit one day. It is for these reasons, among others, that students should complete student-designed summer break projects as opposed to teacher-designed alternatives.
