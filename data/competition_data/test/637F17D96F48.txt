Some students are born gifted in sports, or whatever they have a special talent in. This is not always the same with student's grades. For some students, good grades come naturally, as if they don't even have to try, but for some students, getting a C grade may be an accomplishment. Now, what if the star of a sports team had a C grade and was really trying their best in school? the team would be much worse. I'm not saying that all kids who play sports get bad grades, but what if the ones who did were the best of the team, or maybe even the whole school? The sports programs would crumble due to a lack of players who could not achieve a B average.

So, some changes that could be made to this policy could be: the player's grades must go up at least 2 grade marks (not letter grades) if the student's average in a certain class was a C or below. this way, it is more achievable for all students with all types of grades. Also, the principal should take into account the average grades of all the students who play sports. Someone can't just snap their fingers and give a failing student a B in their classes, some students are not able to improve their grades so drastically.

Although using sports as a motive to get better grades in school is a good idea, it may be too much to ask for some players on the team, so a goal more adapted for each student would work much better, so the school could examine each student's weak subjects, and make a plan individually for each subject or whatever type of schoolwork is giving the student the most trouble, and give each student their own requirements to qualify.

This way, a student can participate on the sports team more easily, and still improve their grade averages.
