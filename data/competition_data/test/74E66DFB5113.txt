Dear Principal

I am an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME and I'm for students to have a grade B average to participate in sports and other activities. It is un-right that students don't have to work hard to do something great or incredible. Students should show that, "Hey, I deserve this. I worked hard and got good grades. Let me get to do this activity." Instead of this, " Oh, well i did my best i could and still got okay grades. I should get to do this." That isn't right.

An example of what's good is, "I'm in NJHS ( National Junior Honor Society) and I keep my grades above an 85, and i do my community service hours." That sounds great, and you know what, it is. Those are the kind of students that get to stay in something like that. They are proving to people that they really want to do this. They are the students that should be in these groups, and still get to do this.

An example of a student who doesn't work for it is this. "I'm in NJHS, i get B's and C's, and i don't do my community hours. It doesn't matter if I do bad now, I am just trying to do this." That's just proving that you never try your best to do anything. You just try to do it, but you aren't proving it that you should be in this school group.

Another example is in sports. A lot of students like to go out for sports during the year. They make it, but most of the top players never get to play that much. That's because they are to worried about practicing the sport, and not caring about their grades. Students who do keep their grades up get to play, because they are more worried about keeping their grades up instead of practicing, because grades go first before anything does.

My final example is school clubs. I play chess twice a week with all of my friends, because it's fun and relaxing to do after a long day of school, but a lot of students like to go to chess to just hang out and not care to play. If you going to go to a school club, actually go and do what you're suppose to do, not just watch people play, but you playing against them, and winning. But the only way to do that is to keep our grades up, so if don't have a good grade in that class, you shouldn't be going to a club till you proven yourself that i achieved the grade to stay in, but just don't try, go above and beyond what you could do, and keep doing it.

So that is why school should come first, then you figure out what to do for an activities. You should always, and I mean always deal with school work first, and just say "Okay I reached to grade I need to stay or join," but keep going of what you can do. Reach you're full potential, and you should be awarded for what you have done.
