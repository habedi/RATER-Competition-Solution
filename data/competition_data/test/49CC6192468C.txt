Summer projects are frowned upon by many students across the U.S, but why are they even assigned in the first place? They provide us with material to review and they also give us the opportunity to get something under our belt that we may have had complications with during the school year. Lately, an astounding amount of students believe that these project should be 'student designed' instead of ' teacher designed'. this means that these projects that help students review certain materials before the schools year start would be designed by the students and not the teacher. 'Teacher-designed' projects allow the students to review past material and to work on skills/subjects that they were struggling with.

Teachers design these projects so their students can study all of the material, not just the the things that were simple and easy to complete. Having the students work on material that was taught during the year allows them to keep the information in their heads, so they won't forget things such as: how to solve for x when 2x+4=0 or what a fault line is. Every student will have the material in their heads so when they come back to school they wont be struggling to pass.

'Teacher-designed' projects also allows students that are struggling with a certain piece of material to review it, work on it, and try to learn said piece. Every student across the Earth has at least one or two things that they struggle with during the year. Having teachers design the summer projects allows them to add in those specific points, so the students that are having trouble will have a chance to work on it. This also allows them to not have to struggle to pass in the up coming school year, if they do happen to take advantage of it.

Students believe that they will be given too much work to complete resulting in them not being able to enjoy their summer. Now, if they would work on the project little by little everyday or every other day then they would get the assignment completed that way the could enjoy their summer without a care in the world. Most students decide to do the work last minute causing them to be stressed and get a low grade, due to the fact that they were rushing to get it completed by a certain time. they also believe if that if the students designed to project they could get it done quickly by only dded material that they know and that they are comfortable with, but what are they really getting out if it? Maybe. their whole summer to goof off and a decent grade when they go back to school? they wont the same opportunity of reviewing material if it was like this. causing them to struggle and possibly fail.

Students mainly focus on getting the project done instead of focusing on what they need to learn or know by the fall. Teachers dont give us work to be mean, they give us this work because they want us to pass and so we have to correct material to move on in our young adult lives. Projects give us the chance to show what we know and give us a chance to go over the things we know and what we should know.
