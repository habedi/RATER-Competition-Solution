As we look back through the records of histroy, humans have made and continue to make an extraorindary advancment in technology. These transformations in technology have worked and cooperated with humans to make life better. In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," new advancements in self-driving cars are presented. Though there are many drawbacks of the idea as of right now, humans will make another historial breakthough as they always have. I believe the idea of driverless cars should be promoted due it being more safe, efficient, and helpful to our everyday lives.

The first reason of why I support driverless cars is because of how much more safer it is. If you look out to our world today, machines have replaced so much of what used to be the works of humans. That was because of machines being more capable of precision and safety. Many factory works have been transferred over to machines who do not have to rely on anyone else and additionally does not have to be concerned about safety. In the same way, we can see how much more safe driverless cars are. Google has proven this because their "cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash." In our world today, there are car accidents occuring every minute of our lives. If we can reduce the amount of accidents through driverless cars, then the lives of people will be more safe. Because of how driverless cars can ensure the safety of humans, I support it.

The second reason why I defend the idea of driverless cars is because of how dependent society can be towards these cars. Although driverless cars are not as developed as we wish to, they will be completed to perfection in the near future. With driverless cars being perfected by manufacturers, they will be more cooperative as they can coordinate themselves with other driverless cars so accidents will not happen, and they will find out the shortest distance and time to a certain destination. Google's cofounder Sergey Brin envisions of a more sophisticated car that enables more efficientcy than that of the human: "The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world." With the development of these cars, they can replace all the cars humans drive with a great transportation system for public-transport and commuters. I support driverless cars because of how they can steer the world into a better place.

Lastly, I endorse self-driving cars because of how helpful it will be to humans. If you were in in an emergency situation where you couldn't drive but needed to go to a hospital, driverless cars would literally save your life. Not only that, but if you are a child and you have no one that can drive you to your game, or grocery store, or friends house, you never have to ask anyone ever again for a ride. A driverless car would always be there to help you in your times of inconvenience. Because of how convenient driverless cars can be, it is one more step of why I defend driverless cars.

No matter how crazy an idea or an invention of technology may be, they were made to make the lives of humans better. Every invention had its own times of adversity: The lightbulb, computers, planes, and even the car itself. Every piece of technology had to go through numerous amounts of trial and error to become what it is today. This concept applies to driverless cars as well. We are merely in the stage of development and trial and error so that driverless cars can be made to perfection for the comfort of human lives. I support the idea of driverless cars because of how safe, efficient, and life-changing it will be to humans.
