I am here to tell you why I think the, "Face on Mars" is a myth or misunderstanding. The Viking 1 Space craft was circling the plantet when they spotted the resemblence of a face. Here are a few reasons why I think this "Face" is just a misconception.

The NASA crew had stumbled upon the image when they were orbiting their sister ship Viking 2 Spacecraft. They may have gotten a clear image of the "Face" but they hadn't known the conditions of the planet before they made the assumption of Martian activity. They plastered it all over the US not knowing if the "Face" was really evidence of alien life on planets; excluding Earth.

Garvin recognized the landform. He said it had looked like a butte or a mesa he had seen on earth. Who knows if the the landforms on earth can form on a different planet. Garvin said, and I quote, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

Scienctists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. There have been "buttes" or "mesas" in the region of Cydonia before. I do not understand why this "Face on Mars" is any different if it was common in the region where it was found. The formation looked like a face. Okay well, sometimes you see random formations on the street with trash. You wouldn't give it a second glance. So, I don't know why this formation on Mars would be any different.

I believe that the formation is just different shadows coming together to make one big shadow. The brain can do crazy things, even trick you at times. I think the formation is just a mind trick that everyone fell for.
