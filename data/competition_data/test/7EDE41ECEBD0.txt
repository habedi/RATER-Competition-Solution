I believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Every student has their own way of learning to finish their goals in life. That means enrolling in online classes might be the best option for their future. Online or long distance learning would benefit kids because it is very flexible, can be used everywhere, and creates fewer chances of bullying or unwanted peer pressure.

Not all families are fortunate enough to send all their kids to school everyday. Some teenagers might have to work instead of schooling just to help their families survive. Online classes can be done at anytime of the day and can even be pushed back to compensate for lost time. This would help students all around the world learn, study, and become the type of person they want to be later on in life. Letting the next generation be smarter and stronger will create new opportunities for generations after that and so on.

In some areas, schools are very far apart from one another and students have to travel far distances in order to attend them. In more rural places, kids have to walk to and back from school. To combat this, online classes would diminish the trek and let students work from anywhere they please. This would not only benefit the students, but also ease the minds of all the people that care for the student's safety. If more kids could be able to learn about modern day problems and solutions, the world would become a better place.

Many kids suffer from bullying in school, and they have to put up with it because they can't just walk out of school anytime they want. This leads to depression and anxiety later on in life. Millions of teenagers these days have to deal with the terrible parts of the day just to be able to learn and have a chance at a brighter future. If some kids that suffer from this took classes online where they feel safe and secure, the chance of experiencing depression or overall sadness wouldn't be affecting them as much. I believe if this was possible for all students, that the rate of high school dropouts would decline and the number of high school graduates would be exponentially higher.

Even though some kids might not have the chance or ability to take classes at home, I strongly agree that taking online school would benefit the masses. I have not only seen it my life, but I have heard that many people love online schools. Being able to take online classes or video conferencing would be positive for students because of its ability for them to choose the time of which they learn, place of where the want to learn, and who they want to learn with. Sure this might be a challenge for some kids or parents, but the benefits out weigh the consequences a hundred times over.
