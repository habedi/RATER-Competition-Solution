Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to tell u that kids should bring there phones to school because u never know when there's going to be a emergency. but they shouldn't because it is going to be a distraction to them when they are in class. I don't really have a opinion to it because in both cases there is a good thing about it and a problem to it.

For example what happens if a kid parent had a problem at work and he cant pick him up when school is over how is the dad going to tell his son that he has a problem and that he is not going to pick him up. or maybe that the boy had to stay after school for a program or serve detention how is he going to tell his father that he is going to stay and the father is going to get mad at him because he didn't inform him about what was going to happen after school.

On the other hand having it is going to be a distraction as i said before because many other kids are not going to pay attention. They are going to be on the phone while the teacher was giving the lesson for that day. Not all the kids do that they may find a excuse so that they could message while they where out of class and the teacher thinking that he/she went to the restroom or to pick up something from another class.

As u see there is going to be a problem picking witch one is ok for the school and many are going to agree or disagree. i couldn't pick one as u see but i gave u two reasons why it is good and why it's bad for us students. i know it is going to be a tough desition but your going to be ok with it.

your student,
