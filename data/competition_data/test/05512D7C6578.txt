Dear Principal,

In representation for the school i think community service should not be required. I think community service should not be required because, there are a lot of things kids do outside of school that contribute to their lifestyle. For example some students are in sports and community service would cut into their time being able to practice or go to games. However some students may like the idea of community service. I think that community service should be added as an extracurricular activity to those who wish to participate in it. There are many pros and cons of required community service. For example some cons are that community service could be cutting back in peoples family time or as mentioned earlier cutting in to peoples time to participate in athletic activities. There may just be some students who do not wish to participate in community service and as result may transfer schools reducing good and bad test scores. Although some pros include meeting knew people and helping serve our community. I think until further notice community service should be an optional activity and not required for the better of some students and the school. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and i hope you consider my thoughts and do what you think is the best for the students and the school.

Best Regards,
