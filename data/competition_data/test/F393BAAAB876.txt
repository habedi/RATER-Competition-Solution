Summer is the best time of the year for most of the students; it is the season that brings them joy and memories. But, without an organized summer plan, the students are very likely to forget what they have learned in the school year. Because of that, some education systems suggest summer projects for students to practice lessons during their break. However, these assignments that are designed by teachers seem to be unreasonable overload and can ruin the summer vacation that the students have been waiting for. Therefore, students and teachers will both be beneficial in learning and teaching if the lessons are well-designed. Although some may say that teacher-designed projects will consist of more important lessons, those that are designed by the students will surely be effective due to its interesting topics and reasonable schedule.

Students will be more motivated if the topics come from their fields of interest. With these lessons, there will be less delay for students to work. They will explore new lessons that will later be helpful in their future careers; they would be no longer summer projects but are life lessons. For instance, in Generic_School, yearly, there are Capstone topics for students to research a topic of their own interest. There are still requirements that the topics need to meet in order to assure that students will learn new facts from their research; but, the lessons' topics are designed by the students. Because of the new learning structure, more students were involved in the projects which resulted in interesting ideas. These projects let the students to express themselves through learning. Another example, summer field trips nowadays are mostly created by students, and they are being applied to new lessons more due to their effectiveness in teaching. Letting the students to design the experiences of the lessons means letting they create their own memories of the lessons which will last longer than that of traditional methods. Being able to explore their fields of interest motivates the students, rather than compels them to learn.

Beside having a break and doing school's projects, students should have time for other activities. These activities are the main part of the summer vacation. But, it would be impossible for them to distress and try these new activities if there isn't any time. Junior rising students seem to not have access to summer break due to the overload works in preparing for the SAT and some of the school summer projects. Therefore, if the summer goes on with unreasonable loads of lessons and practices that are needed to be done, there would be lack of access for them to other activities. Summer is also the time for students to explore interesting future careers through internship and jobs opportunities. Consequently, looking at the bigger picture, if a student busy with the summer works from school, he or she will be lost in choosing interesting fields in the future due to their lack of experiences. That says, it is important for students to have time to access new activities that will determine their future.

However, there are people who believe that summer projects that are made by students will not cover enough important information, thus teacher-designed projects are the perfect choice. It is true that important lessons must be covered, but that only should be done during the school year, not during the summer break. Doing so in the summer will distress students even more due to their lack of free time. If the pressure on students keep gaining, mental diseases like depression and mood changes will appear. There are many students in Generic_School and high schools around the world have gotten mental disorders which origin is from school works. Therefore, the main component of the teaching system should be the effectiveness of the lessons, not the amount lessons that are being taught. This is a major cons of the current education system and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible. And the only ones who can truly understand the problem are the students. Thus the student's opinions towards the structure of the school's system are very important.

Projects and lessons should be designed by the students to guarantee the quality of the lessons. Through interesting topics,students will be more motivated to learn and explore new lessons. They will also have time for new activities, which will eventually help them in life. And more importantly, students will be able to avoid mental diseases, depression, etc; therefore, it creates a healthy generation of young adults. Overall, summer projects that are provided by schools should be created from the opinion and interest of students.
