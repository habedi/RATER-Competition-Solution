Phones & Driving

Driving with a cell phone is very common, yet very dangerous at the same time. This is because phones tend to cause a distraction among, not just teens, but adults as well. Driving with phones have become so crucial, it has become against the law to drive with a phone in hand. The leading cause of teenage deaths in America are car accidents. The fatal crash rate for teens is three times greater than drivers ages twenty and over. Having phone in hand while driving has made for numerous unfortunate deaths for people. The main cause is not being focused on getting to a destined location before picking up a phone. The situation has gotten so severe, the Apple company( made for iPhone), has taken matters into their own hands. They have created 'do not disturb' to detect when a person is in a moving car at certain miles per hour, to keep them from having any distractions as far as notifications or calls.

There have been inventions made to lessen the use of phones while driving, so as the phone holder and using bluetooth connected to a car. Though these things are helpful, it still can be a distraction while driving; as far as maneuvering to answer a call and inserting a phone into a phone holder. Driver distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. After reviewing this information, it's more favorable to not use a cellular device at all whatsoever while behind a wheel. By putting the phone down and taking small steps toward safe driving, even if it takes pulling the car over, will help lower crash/death rates around the globe. In conclusion, phones and driving do not coincide well, and should be prevented no matter what the cause is.
