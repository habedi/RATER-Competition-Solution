With technology being used more in society, websites like Khan Academy and IXL are being used increasingly more than before. To adapt to these changes, schools have started to offer distance learning which allows students to take classes from the comfort of their homes. If students were to take distance learning courses, they will benefit and learn more effectively from these courses.

Firstly, the student will feel comfortable learning at home. To elaborate, the student taking the classes will be able to learn at their own pace and feel relaxed. For example, my precalc class has a lot of topics to cover over the span of 9 months. In order to teach everything in the curriculum in a class that lasts for 90 minutes, my teacher often spends a week to two weeks on a given topic, giving me, the student, little time to digest all the new information I received. If I were to take the same class but online class at home, I would be able to take my time to truly learn and understand each concept. The location of the class can also impact ones learning ability. For example, my World History 2 class had many students that took the class to be with their friends. Every other day, the group of friends that sat in the back of the class would always take over the teacher, resulting in me not being able to hear the lesson. To combat this, I would go home at the end of the day and watch a video explaining the lesson I was supposed to learn that day. At the end of the school year, I learned that it is beneficial to have a quiet place to study and what better place to study than at home.

Secondly, distance learning courses will help the student save money on class materials. For example, my English class required me to buy many items: two notebooks, a three-inch D-ring binder, a folder, black pens, and pencils. The cost of these items totaled a little more than $50. That was the price of the materials for just one of my seven classes. For a distance learning course, the most a student will spend, given they already own a computer, is $10 for paper and pencils to do work with. The student doesn't need to buy folders or binders for online classes because all of the documents will be online. The student can also revisit the documents at a later date for an online class, unlike the papers in a binder which can be lost or worn down over time. The money the student saves from not having to buy class materials can be put into paying for college.

Skeptics will say that distance learning courses deprive kids and teens of their needed interaction time with others. While the student may not be able to interact with their fellow companions during school hours, they will still have plenty of time after school. The role of a student is not to only enjoy their time with friends but to study for the future. Interactions with friends are important for students so they do not burn themselves out after studying for hours. I do not see my friends all day during school, but I always find time to relax, have conversations, and study with friends when school ends.

To summarize, while being comfortable for the student, distance learning courses offer all the same benefits as classes in schools. Given the opportunity, I would replace some of my classes with classes I can take online in the comfort of my home. The cost of the online classes can also help you in the future because you'll be saving money on class materials.
