Dear Principal

I believe we should help are community, why? because for many colleges it requires that a student has help their community. A good reason why its a good idea to help is taking care of our community will not only help with working together but making people happy as well. A good idea for who are against you should have a contest for each class. Who ever has helped the most, that class would get a special prize like a free trip for each student family and teacher. This would encourage students because most students like rewards for their hard work.

Another reason why helping people around our community will be good is it will let out our school be noticed. Parents would be proud of their kids and people in are community would be honored to have a school like ours in the community. A environment like that would wonderful for our school. It could also lead to more students joining the school too.

When we help people, in return they help back. Just helping people could also lead to more wonderful things. Helping people who are sick or who need help getting around will give a good positive feeling. It can be recognize by people that we could get a free field trip to somewhere amazing and fun for all the students hard work. Also cleaning up little for are community would are community gorgeous and not disgusting and dirty.

That's why we should help are community.
