If u want to see or visit unique places with your family make sure u sigh up for Seagoing Cowboys program .My Personal opinion is that it seems worth it and Fun and exciting .You get to China ,Europe,italy and even more .Tis guy named luke had to help is aunt katie on her farm. As a boy had perpared Luke for hard work but not dangers at sea .As the second night Luke served as a night watchman.

One day he got on the ship and he had fun especisally coming return trips after animals had been unloading they played baseball volley ball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed .They played Table-tennis tournaments. Fencing .Boxing ,reading whittleing .And games also hepled pass the time .

These are some activity there while you are on the ship. There might be even stuff for the adults on the ship while people are witing to visit the nice places. This is why u should join the program of seagoing cowboys.
