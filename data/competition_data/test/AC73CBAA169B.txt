I do agree with this decision for many reasons. Extracurricular activities can be very benefiting in many different ways. First, off you can meet new people and make new friends. Second, you can learn a new sport/skill from this activity depending on what you are doing. Also depending on what you decide to do your skill could benfit others like the yearbook. There are many reasons that extracurricular activities can help.

Extracurricular activities can introduce to new people. You can meet new people and get to know other people a little bit more. There are many types of people and if you want to meet other people who do the same things you can pick that activity. For example if you wanted to meet people who play basketball you can try out for the basketball team or if you wanted to meet people who like music you can join the band. There are also many ways to get to know familiar faces a little better. You are doing something you like while meeting people that you could like or already do. Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people.

You could learn a new sport/skill from what you do. For example you have always been really in to computers but you decide you like soccer you could join the soccer team. You would be learning how to play a sport you have never tried before. You could also want to join the photography club you would be able to learn how to use a camera and download photos to a computer. There is always something new to learn and you should always go the extra mile to learn something. Extracurricular activities are a great way to learn.

You could also benifit others from what you are doing for example student council helps everybody because of all the things that they do for the school itself. Any club or team can help in a way like winning a championship brings pride to the school or the yearbook club who put together all of the best memories throughout the year. Everyone can help in their own way no matter how big or small each club helps others.

Every club in benefiticial and should be used to help others and learn. They help you meet new people and try new things. Everything can help you and that is why I do agree with his decisions for everyone to join a club because of all the benefits it can have for you. Some people don't like to be that social but they should still join an extracurricular activity because in the long run it will help them out a lot. Extracurricular activies are going to help everyone in one way or another.
