Can this new technology called Facial Action Coding System or FACS help? Yes, it can help because it can identify a human's emotions. Some don't understand it but it actually could help. the way it can help is by helping our kids when they are in school.

Hold on, how can this help our kids while there at school? It is able to help them because it can tell how someone is feeling while they are learning. "A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts." "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."(Dr. Huang) In other words it can make something they don't understand easier, but without feeling dumb in front of there peers by asking the teacher if they can explain it in a easier way in class.

To sum this up, the way it can help is by helping our kids in school. It can detect how they are feeling while they are doing there work. It also can make it easier for them to do there school work if they don't want to ask the teacher how to do or so they can understand it better.
