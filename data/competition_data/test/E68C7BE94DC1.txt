The dangers of studying venus is that we have never landed on this planet or ever landed something on this planet venus has an atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets the challengins in this planet are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus tempature. the condition are far more exreme than anything humans have ever encounter here on earth such an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean.

NASA is working on other approches to studying venus for example an old technology called mechanical computers these devices were first envisionrd in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II. venus is the second planet from our sun venus is sometimes called the evening star it is one of the brightest points of light in the sky making venus simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.

Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth it has proved a very challanging place to examine more closely. That is why our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
