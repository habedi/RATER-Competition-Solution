Their next idea was to send a spacecraft up but when they did it only sayed up for maybe two hours without failing. Although their first plan failed witht the spacecraft they came up with another idea for sending spacecraft back to Venus. They found a material that might be able to support the spacecraft from the heat. In order to see if this spacecraft woud work the tested it in a similator that was close to what was happening to venus and the spacecraft lasted up to three weeks in the conditions alot longer than the last one. This is another idea that supports his idea of still exploring it because they might of found a safer and better way to do it.
