Schools always want what is best for their students, giving them summer projects so that they can continue learning during their summer break is an amazing idea. However, having student-designed projects would not be the best option to go with. Teacher-designed projects would have more of an impact on students in continuing their education outside of school than having them do a project designed by students themselves. Teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects are both great ideas but the projects that the teachers have made themselves in a better route to go. A teacher's project would not only be more beneficial towards the future of students and push them to go to greater lengths with their knowledge but they will also assure that the what student is doing that will actually help them learn during their summer vacation.

Children are the future and should think wisely about their life in the long run so that they can have the best life possible. All successful lifestyles do not always start with going to college, getting your degree, and finding a well-paying job it can start from inside your garage like Steve Jobs did to create

Apple . Although not all will be as lucky as Steve Jobs. Therefore, it would be a wise choice for students to go to college to get their life started on the right track. Projects like the ones given out during break could possibly prepare them for what they will see when they do go to college. Especially if they take honors or AP classes during high school, unfortunatelyÂ those projects will be a bit more difficult but they will be more beneficial so that the students to know what to expect in the long run.

These projects will also push the students to go to greater lengths and actually think it out for themselves without asking for a teachers help or looking it up online. With that, giving the students a project made to further their education and challenge them a tad bit would be a project made by certified educators themselves. Being challenged is an essential thing to do to everyone. Therefore, the student will know that they are smarter than what they believe when they finally understand some work that may be a little challenging. Giving students even the littlest push will be better than them not trying at all. Students should think for themselves and want to challenge themselves and not try to cheat off others or from online sources. Student-designed projects would not give students the kick start that they need in life.

Although having student-designed projects would be more creative and within the comfort zone of the students, having a teacher-designed project would most likely achieve the goal of the students learning during summer vacation. Assuring that the students do indeed learn during their duration away from school is a big factor of giving them teacher-designed projects. Teachers could give out projects that are fun, educational, and challenging keeping in mind it will still be teaching them from outside of the classroom. It would not help the the student nor the teacher if the student learn nothing from their summer project. It would be more stress on both people, more teaching for the teaching and more work and learning for the student. Therefore, them learning from outside the classroom would be greatly achieved by the teachers making the projects for the students.

Given these reasons, teachers should be the only ones making summer projects for their students. Being more beneficial towards the future of the students, pushing them to go to greater lengths with their knowledge and assuring that they are actually learning is better than having easy projects that can be done within fifteen minutes. Students at least be given the opportunity to create a project and allow a teacher to look over it to see if it falls under those 3 reasons. Teachers should also try to at least make it enjoyable for everyone not just for the students it would be pretty boring to grade a boring project. The teacher could listen to ideas of the students and combine them together to make everyone happy.
