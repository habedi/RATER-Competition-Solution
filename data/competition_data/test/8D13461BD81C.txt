To the Principal:

I highly suggest that you go with Policy 1. The reasons I suggest this is because most of the time students want to use their cell phones before or after class or at lunch. Now if we go with Policy 2, students will not have the chance to use their cell phones. I know that because students will obey the rules and turn their cell phones off during class.

If you go with Policy 2, students will break the rules to use their cell phones. This will increase the possibility for students to interrupt their class time and the people around them. But if you use the 1st Policy students will have a different opinion on what they are doing. Some will even use their cell phones with no regards to the rules. They would use it and usually they won't get caught even influencing more to use it. Now with the opportunity they will just wait until after class to reply to that text or return that phone call.

Students will be grateful with this opportunity. They will learn how to not abuse it and obey the rules. Now if students take this opportunity for granted, just remove the Policy and go with Policy 2. But honestly, I think you will have no problem letting the students use their cell phones.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
