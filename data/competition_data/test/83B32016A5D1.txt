Dear Principal,

I think it is very important to do community service. Even though some people do not enjoy it, I think students should be required to perform at least two tasks of community service.

A few reasons why I think community service is important is your giving back to others. For example, volunteering at a Soup Kitchen. Helping the people that need things more than you do.

You may already be doing community service and you don't even know it, that's how many options you have to do something. Things as simple as picking up a bag or a can you see laying in the street are considered community service. You helping the community by picking up trash. Even holding the door for people, just to be nice. That is community service.

Some of my friends already do community service anyways, and if they do, then other students must too. They volunteer at places like elementary schools to tutor the children, there and others clean up the litter outside of the building.

So, I do think students should have to perform community service. At least two tasks. Because, it is a way to help the community, and help people, and even help the environment. Community service ranges from things as big as volunteering most of your day to an organization, or just picking up garbage outside.

Sincerely,

Your Student
