The reason why the summer project should be student-designed, because the student would be interested,and their knowledge about things would expand. They would researching about their topic,and things they want to know more about, when they learn new facts they would apply it to their everyday life. The summer project would keep their knowledge fresh for the next year.

The topic the the teacher gives you maybe boring, so students don't feel like doing it that is not fair to the kids were you are not allowed to chose your own topic. It keep the student busy. Doesn't allow them to sit around the house playing video games and watching television. Maybe the assignment has to with them being outside like: watching people play basketball,football,walk their pets. In third grade there was this project they we had to do over the summer, were I had to walk around my neighborhood to count how many car were different colors, then we had to make a bar graph to see the percentage. then we had to look up what color car gets pulled over more, and come to find out red cars get pulled over more than any other car. The decisions, were the student or teacher should design the summer project. The student should be allowed to design the summer project, because you want student to be engage and willing to succeed and prosper throughout the project and through life.
