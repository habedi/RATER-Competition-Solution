You should join the Seagoing Cowboys! In this program, we go on several adventures to different countries to help recover the food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA created the Seagoing Cowboys program to help recover the damages of World War II, which you can be one of the people to help!

If you think we barely go places, then you're wrong. I have sailed and ocean 18 times while being a Seagoing Cowboy! You might think it takes a massive time out of your life, but it really doesn't. To cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States took me only two weeks! Also, it only took a month to get to China! If you think it is boring, you are wrong once again. When we are sailing across the ocean, we play multiple games, such as baseball and volleyball!

This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I got to help others that have been effected by World War II. I also got to sail around and see other countries you have wanted to see. I got to sail around the world playing volleyball and baseball while I waited! I only had one or two duties to do, besides that it is all fun! Before I had a boring life, but when I joined it was full of adventures!
