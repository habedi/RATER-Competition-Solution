I think they should allow kids to have cell phones during lunch, and other free time periods. But, they should make sure the cell phones are put away when class is starting or have them put it in their locker. Another idea is, if the teachers see their cell phone during class the teacher should take the phone away till after school and have the parent come in and get their phone. I think it's good that teachers do let kids bring their cell phone to school, but if the kids have their phone with them, they don't think about anything else except their phone during class. If the kids get caught having their phone with them the principal should band their cell phone from school until a certain period of time. I think the best policy is policy 1 because it does give kids freedom with their phone but also to have them put it off when their in class. The bad thing about having them put their phone off is, they could still have it in their pocket, or stuck down in their shoe. The teachers should make sure their phone is put away so the kids aren't distracted with anything else except learning.

I do agree with policy 2 too. One of the reasons why i agree with it is so teachers don't have to worry about if the kid has the cell phone or not. So, the kid won't pay attention to anything else non important. Another reason why they shouldn't allow cell phones is, when the kids do get free time on their cell phone, the teachers don't know what the kids are saying to other people, they could be threatening someone, or spreading a rumor about someone that isn't even true.
