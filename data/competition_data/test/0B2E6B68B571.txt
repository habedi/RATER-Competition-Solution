Phones and Driving

Should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle. According to the article "Cellphone Use While Driving Statistics and Texting and Driving Facts" states that according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. "Talking or texting while driving or checking social media posts takes eyes off the brain off the task of driving":

states a message that phones has become a distraction to the human brain, but not only distracting the human brain, but is also becoming a habit to human beings.

Distraction has become a huge part in car crashes and people's injuries. Cellphones has become an important component to many human routines. Therefore, it doesn't come to a surprise or a shocked moment that gadgets such as cellphones, tablets, or any other technology devices are ambiguous. Phones not only put the driver in danger, but also other people such as passengers and the other driver in danger.

So for that exact reason, many states implemented the law to not text while driving or you will get a big, fine ticket just for the safe of other people .
