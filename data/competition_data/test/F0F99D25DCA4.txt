I would just like to start off by saying that the reason why the author thinks that we should keep studing Venus no matter the dangers is because his words "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".

Other reasons we should study Venus is because there is so much more that people today do not know and I personallly feel like as long as we are here on Earth we should be currious about why only our plannet is the only plannet that has humans on it or at least they say. In the article they said "Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system ". We as people should be and should want to be more nosey.

Not only do we people want study Venus but Venus wants us to study it. It is one of the easiest stars to see in the night sky. As the article says "Venus, sometimes called the "Evening Star", is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot".

I also would like to add that it would not be a bad idea to study Venus more bc we already have many facts about this planet so it is not like you would be starting completly from scratch. Some of the facts that we already know that was given to us from the article is "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus", "temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit", and "Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system".

Lastly I would just like to say that I hope from reading this essay I was able to draw you in and hopefully make you more currious and questionable about Venus like would'nt you want to know what is out there or at least what used to be out there or even better what could possiabley going to happen out there.
