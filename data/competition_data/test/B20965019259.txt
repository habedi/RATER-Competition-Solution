To whom it may concern,

It is in the future. You see all the trash and absolutely destroyed building covered in writing you have never seen before. You watch as those whom you once used to talk to and acknowledge with walking on what used to be a park were the little ones used to play but is now replaced with cement. All of what could happen such as what i have now described all depends on your decision as the principal somewhat responsible for your student's lives. I believe that enforcing the idea of a cleaner campus and community provided by students, who may also do other things such as tutoring, would benefit both their future and the futures of people yet to come like children.

Those who do participate in community service can always be beneficial especially to those who do it themselves. It can provide credits for those who wish to go to college and build a better future. It also my allow the students to express themselves as who they may want to be once they are older. Students who tutor other may show great passion for teaching thy next generation while others who clean up may show how much they wish to improve the city by possibly becoming mayor or even president someday. Certain opportunities for those who are ambitious enough to reach it like my own friends who also participate in these kind of services always come when possibly thinking of others and their community.

Even though these chances may come to those who participate in it, it isn't always towards they themselves. It also benefits the people, children of the future. If these students help the community, those who may not have a voice for now can achieve so much more in an organized community like we can have if you can enforce these very thoughts to those whom I'm sure would like to listen. The next generation would also be able to provide so much more in the future once given an example like that which you should partake in as well.

I suggest that starting now with your students including my class mates can help people to come and even influence them in helping out as well.
