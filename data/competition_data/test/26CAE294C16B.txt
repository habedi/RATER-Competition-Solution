It is idiotic to force all students be in a extracurricular activity. There are over 300 student in most United States middle schools. Many schools do not even have a eleventh of that amount of in clubs and sport teams. Think about how many people would have to be in each club if you wanted each student to be in one. Here are more three reasons we should not force children to be in a extracurricular activity.

Reason one, many students will not have rides home. This is because their parents have jobs. They cannot just leave their job to pick up their child. The children who's parents have job, would not be able to be in a club or sport.

Reason two, student already have things after school they need to do. Children have a lot things they need to do after school, two examples are homework and chores. Many children also already have activity they do after school like playing on a local sports team or dance.

Reason three, most things clubs have are bought by teachers. This is because most clubs are not funded by the school, but by the teacher or teachers that run it. The teachers have to buy the snacks and pay for activities the clubs do. Making every student join a club makes it where the teachers would have to spend more money that they might not have.

Many people would say these are not good reasons. Here are three agruements against why we should not force students to join a extracurricular activity. Agruement one is that students can get rides from other people then their parents. Well this is the same as saying if you want a better job then just get one. You see that does not make sense you just cannot get a better job, just like you can not just get someone to pick up your children. Agruement two is that instead of staying on the sport team a student is already on they should just join the school one. Well schools do not always have the a sport team that the student play or that team might be full. Another reason this argument is awful is that the students have worked hard on to be on the sports team they are on, why should they have to give all that up so they can be on the school's team. Agruement number three is that clubs do not need snacks. This is true, but clubs do need activities, and teachers still have to pay for these.

These were three reasons that we should not force students to be in extracurricular activities. After school clubs and sports are great. Forcing students into them is not. It just does not make sense.
