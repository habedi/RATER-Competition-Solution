The Face on Mars is just a natral landform. Why i say that because, aliens are not real and they can't create the landforms that were seen. If there where aliens then it would been more information found on NASA. If no human or thing cant't breath in space a alien shouldn't be able to breath there either. There would have been extra evidence found in space if there was a alien seen.

Evedence was found that on the monitor a face apeared on it. But a few days later NASA unveild the image for all to see. The caption noted a ''huge rock formation . . . whitch resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'' a NASA scientist added. '' so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!''

Personally i think there are no such thing is aliens but if they were there would be alot done to earth and landforms. The NASA scientist has done a great job on taking the picture of the artifact.
