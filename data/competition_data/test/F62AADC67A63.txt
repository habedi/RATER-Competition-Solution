Genuinely distance learning is a great way for students to take classes that they require. Most of the time this is due to the fact that someone in the family is part of the military or for some they are just accustomed to move around a lot. But sometimes it all just depends on the certain individual, for example if someone is a visual learner then online classes wouldnt really help because you cant understand it to the full extent. But say someone who learns just by looking at someone do something then online classes would help because the person can understand it better. Sometimes none of those are factors for someone choosing to do online classes, maybe its just that they like the isolation and peace that is hard to find in a classroom.

Online classes are beneficial for everybody especially if your someone who is busy and works a lot. Because of the classes being online then its easy to access anytime and anywhere. On the other hand if you can go to school and take the class in the classroom then i believe that is the better choice because there you can ask for help and get a better understanding then just seeing how to do it. Being in a classroom is a different ambient then working by yourself on a computer. Students would benefit from online classes or video conferencing because if they need the class to graduate and they work then it would be a perfect alternative than going to night school or doing it in class.

Schools should start to offer these opportunities to students because it would be a major help to them. It would change how some students see school and maybe try and give it another go. Most students see that they are failing and decide to just drop out because they dont want to come back to do the same class another time but if schools gave them an option to take it online then things would be different. If distance learning was an option many students would rather do it online than come to school
