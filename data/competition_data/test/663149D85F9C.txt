Dear Principal

In which I take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service. I do think all student should perform community service. Its important to all of us. It could teach us something in all kinds of ways . Well i do know that everyone has a different opinion .

First of all, student might think that it takes too much time of us. Its atually really helpful because we are being responsible. I think that all students should perform in community service . There are alot of student in the streets doing nothing not even going to school . They are probably getting in trouble or doing drugs . I honestly think that they could change they're life by doing community service . They might like it after a while .

Community service is really important for us, even though some student don't think it is . Well it is ! Students that knows why community service is very important for everyone. They should all make a group telling other students why its so important for us .I'm pretty sure that alot of student would change they're mind about community service.

Students that gets introuble should do community service so they could learn something from it . I'm sure that they would learn something .Some student might not want to do community service but some might. I'll do it anytime just to help our environment. Community service is really important for me and for some of my friends .
