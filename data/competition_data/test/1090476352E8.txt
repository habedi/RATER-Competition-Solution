Phones and Driving

Cell Phones are the biggest world problem, they have taken over the majority of million human life's. Most of the world uses their phones for communication and simply fun for themselves. Unfortunately, Phones are a very distractive device and can also be very deadly if used in the wrong moment.

Humans should not be able to have the capacity to use a phone while driving. The majority of the world think multitasking can come in hand while looking at the road and the phone at the same time. People are taking a risk in their own life and another person's life by making a dangerous decision. Driving with a phone in one hand and the other one on the steering wheel is not what society wants.

When driving most forget about many things and think they are on a road with no one else. It is easy to forget about sharing a road with other people especially when being distracted by phone. When anyones phones makes a sound when it goes off, everyone is always curious to see what is it. Whether or not if it is a text, call, social media like/comment or anything else can pop on a phone. Humans get the audacity to pick up the phone no matter what they are doing. It is against the law to pick up a phone or even make a phone call to anyone. By doing that people are not only risking their own life but everyones life who is on the road.

Hands free devices can still be a danger to many with a car. Many say talking on the phone with a cell phone connected to the bluetooth can also be very distracting. Due to the fact that humans having a conversation on the phone while driving, people are more focused on the conversation than they are with driving the car. In most situations , if you cannot simply wait to answer the phone then waiting at a red light might be acceptable or simply moving going to a parked spot.

Overall, cell phones should be banned on the road at all times to prevent anyone in danger from others. It may not be as convenient, but the world will not lose as many lives especially in the teenager area. A text, a tweet, snapchat, or instagram is not worth risking your life and others just to get a like or a text back. In the future, phones should not be the reason of deaths around the world and should not increase how many kids or adults have died because of it or someone else fault.
