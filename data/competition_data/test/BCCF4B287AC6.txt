Dear principal,

I believe that policy one is the better policy for the idea of cell phone use in school. Why i believe this is because if a cell phone is not aloud to be used at all there will be more rule breaking because students will feel as if they most sneak to use there phones.

A cell phone was initially created to keep people around the world in touch an if there is a family emergency or something important comes up during school a cell phone policy such as policy number two is not a good idea. Policy one gives students a chance to use their phones and many students will appreciate that they are not being controlled over something so simple.

The real problem with policy two is that it is not realistic. Children in school are going to break the rule of cell phone use if it is put in place as an act of discipline. This will do nothing positive to a students life either.

These are some reasons i believe that policy one is a much better option the policy two.

Just my point of view,
