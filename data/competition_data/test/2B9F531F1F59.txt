Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has been brought upon my attention the issue concerning community service and wheatear or not it should be required at our school. I strongly urge you to enforce community service at our school because it teaches our students how to manage their time and provides them with an opportunity to receive experience in their future carer.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME students have a difficult time trying to manage their time in a healthy manner. They are continuously late for classes and don't seem to find enough time for home learning. Community service would absolutely benefit our students in needed areas such as those listed. OTHER_NAME, for example, is always late for his core classes and manages a 69% average in every class. He has also been predicted not proficient in class. To assist him in becoming an excellent student his guidance concealer suggest community service in teaching the youth. After realizing he could help other people manage their time wisely he also got into the habit of proceeding the same way in school. Community service can make a difference in an everyday students life therefore it must be required at our school.

Experience in your future career is absolutely a wonderful way to benefit our students in choosing a career for the future. Community service can provide time for students to get a feel on a certain subject in which they are interested in. For example, I always had an interest in working with children. Volunteering at my local church has been a wonderful experience and i also have been educated in ways i wouldn't be able to learn on my own. i feel as if I'm completely prepared to take an internship any given day. Community service is beneficial in everyway and has many different opportunities for our students to consider.

Our students our the future and it's best we give them every opportunity available such as community service.

Your student,

STUDENT_NAME
