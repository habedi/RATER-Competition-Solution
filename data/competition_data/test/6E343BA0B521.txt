TEACHER_NAME

i think that students should be allowed to bring there cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time the reason i feel this way is because some people use their phones for emergency like if something happed to there loved ones like if they are in the hospital or if there parents have to come and get them for school they can be ready but some people wouldn't use there phones for emergency they would use it to text there friends or call them and some of them would use them during class then they are breaking the rules if a student breaks the rules by using them in class then i feel they should be taken away and cant get it back Intel the end of the day but i also feel if they keep using them in class and the teacher takes it away three times they cant get it back Intel the end of the school year and if they just get a new one and that gets taken by a teacher then they cant get that one back Intel the end of the year and they will have oss for three days and to make this happen every student who wants two bring there cell phone to school they should sign a contract say every thing i just said and if they don't want two sign it then they don't have to but they wont be able to use there phones in school at lunch or any free time they get and if they do have it and didn't sign the contract then the phone will be taken away for the whole school year
