I agree because they can learn from doing the activities. But not only they can learn, they can also have fun, and get motivated as well. Doing nothing would solve anything and would be lack of motivation. Because students need to have fun, be motivated, and learn as well. It might even help them in the near future.

A reason why students can participate in sports is because, they can get more healthy and stronger. For example, participating in sports can burn calories. And it can also help students that are not in shape, to get in shape. Second example, a good student can serve in the council. And they can help other students with their struggles.

But overall I agree that all students should participate in at least one activity. They could even get credit or a grade from participating in any activities. Students can find ways to have fun, get motivated, and even learn from the activities as well. It can help them with things in the future too. And students can look back at what they have accomplished.
