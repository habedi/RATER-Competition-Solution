Should all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Well most school's have extracurricular activity's for their students, but the school's activities are usually optional. I think student's should at least participate in one extracurricular activity, because it will help student's to build friendship's, and have more opportunity's.

First of all while a student is doing an extracurricular activity, the student will most likely have to interact with other students. When interacting with new people, that can also lead to building more friendship's. In addition, student's that have more friends will feel more confident and will have a better social life. The students will also feel more comfortable when meeting new people and interacting with them. The student will have more people to talk to and to hangout with. When having more people to talk to will help people see different view points and different idea's.

Finally, a student will have more opportunity's with their life when doing an activity. If they join an activity that will help with high school credits. And college's look for students that can serve for them, so when doing an activity that will help college's notice you more because it will show that you can do something for that college. And you several college's might notice you and you might have to choose one, so you will have different option's to look at.

In conclusion I can that I think that all student's should do at least one extracurricular activity because it will lead to more friendships and most likely have more opportunities for that student. But student should choose what activity they can do, because they need to enjoy to be more social and be friendly to others.
