I think that the first policy is the best, because it doesn't do any harm to allow students to have their phones during free time or lunch since there are no classes going on at the time. Really there are only two main problems with having cell phones during classes; texting the answers on a test or quiz to a friend, and distracting and disrupting the other students and teachers. Many kids in the middle schools have phones now and they will try to bring them into classes, and carry them around at lunch. Many other schools allow phones during lunch breaks, so I am told by kids from other schools. If a student has his/her phone in their pocket during a class but it is either off, on silent mode, or on airplane mode(phone is unable to text or call or use any sort of feature that requires a signal) it won't disrupt the other class mates. However, it still may be a distraction during class, so then they should remain either off, or not in their pocket, but in their locker. I see teachers using their cell phones in classes all the time, so why shouldn't we be aloud to use ours at lunch or free time?

If a student has a phone and they either have free time or it is lunch period, they should be able to have their phones out and be able to call or text. Some students forget things that they needed for the day and they call or text their parents to bring them to school for them; books, P.E. clothes, lunches, flash drives, assignments, and other things that you may need for a class. And at lunch breaks teachers are usually in the teacher's lounge eating lunch so we are unable to use their classroom phones to call our parents if we are in need of something or aren't feeling good.

I think that phones should be aloud in schools during lunch breaks and free time because even if they are not aloud, kids will still use them and just hide them from teachers which isn't good. If they are just aloud during free time and lunch, kids will have a set time to be able to use their phones and they won't be breaking any rules, or distracting or disrupting others. There is no harm done to allow the use of cell phones during lunch or free time, so why not let the students be able to use them if they have them?
