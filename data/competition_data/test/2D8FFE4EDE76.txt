I do think the use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is valuable. This new technologly can identify the emotion of humans. I would expecially recommed this in a classroom. The new technologly would make it easier for teachers. The FACS could be a subsitute for a teacher.

Why I think this new technologly is good is because it can tell weather the students are happy, sad, mad, bored, or confused. With there being many students in the class, teacher isnt able to see and tell every students emotions. By adding the FACS to the classroom ,it would make it easier. For example the passage said "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen , a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." This technologly could modify the lesson ,like an effective human instructor.

In conclusion, this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This would be a real good improvment in the schools around the world. This new software has promising applications for a variety of industries. This why I argue for this claim. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!
