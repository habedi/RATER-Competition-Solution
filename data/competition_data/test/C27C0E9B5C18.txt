I think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. How does someone knows others feelings? Well the new technology can notice how someone is feeling. Dr. Huang new computer software stores similiar anatomical information as electronic code. The article states, " Dr. Huang observes that artists studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely to convey specific emotions." I personally think that it should be valuable to use this technology to read student emotions in a classroom. I think it is valuable because you should worry about how your classmates are feeling, you should recognize when a teacher is becoming upset with the class, and also should know when someone is getting confused with the assignment.

In life today more than over thousands of students would want to use Dr. Huang new software. In the article it say, "the computer software can know your mixed emotions." Alot of students today are worried about their surrounding and others' emotions in school. Most student would like to argue that it is not valuable to use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. Some people might disagree because they'll probably think like,

" worry about yourself and your own emotions." People wouldn't want others to know how they are feeling. " Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," Dr. Haung predicts.

In a classroom you should always worry about how your classmates feeling. The article predicts, " to notice when someone is happy they indicates the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one." So when your classmates smile like they are forced to they are unhappy. In an unhappy smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatiz major and a different muscle. This tells me to look closely to classmates reactions and smiles. If you look closely to a classmates smile you can recognize how they are feeling. Refering back to the text it states, " faces don't lie."

Secondly, you should recognize when a teacher is becoming upset with the class. Noticing when a teacher is getting upset because the class is to loud and disrespectful, just look at his/her face expression. You should have to use Dr. Huang new computer software to notice when someone is upset. If the teacher is frowning and began to stop teaching they are disappointed. To notice someone emotions it's all about those muscular action units.

How do you know when someone is getting confused, bored, or irritated with an class assignment? By wondering when someone is confused, bored, or irritated look t their reactions. Are they huffing and puffing? Are they sighing? If someone is sighing or huffing and puffing that means that they are either irritated or bored by the assignment. Usually when a student is bored by the assignment they'll just fall asleep.

This essay explains why I agree that the use of this technology to read students emotions is valuable and why others think it is not valuable.
