Do you think all kids should have to do an extracurricular activity for school? I think having extracurricular activities is good to have in schools because it gives kids the chance to do different things they want to do. I also think schools should encourage students to do extracurricular activities. However, I do not think students should be forced to do an extracurricular activity at school because they might be too busy with there school work, they might have an after school job, and they could already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school.

My first reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is because they might be to busy with school work at home. Teachers give out a lot of homework in each class and some students need a lot of time to do it. Making them do an activity after school, that they probably don't even want to do, might give them a hard time because then they might not get there homework done. If they manage to do do the activity and get there homework done then they might get to bed later than usually then they will not be able to do there best the next day and all the days after.

My second reason why students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because they might have a job after school. Even if the activity that student joined only meets once a week they still might need to work that day and can't request off. They also might have the job because they need to help provide for there families. You never know what a student goes through outside of school.

My last and finally reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because what if they are already doing one outside of school. A lot of students are already doing something they want to do outside of school and if they get forced to do an extracurricular activity in school they wouldn't have enough time for the one there doing outside of school. They shouldn't have to quit one they might have been doing there whole life with friends they love to start a whole new one. It wouldn't be fair to the student.

In conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they might not have time to do one because of personal reasons. They might have to help provide for there family because there parents can't, they might need extra help with school and have a tutor help them everyday, or they might already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school. You do not know what they do when they aren't at school. Therefore, you can't make them do things that the might not be able/want to do.
