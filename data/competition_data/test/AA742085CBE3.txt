The emotional exprssions of students in a classroom should be vauluable . Why do i think that ?

Teachers could know how there students feel about the topic there learning or how much the get it or not.

Another one is when your a manager at a store you can see how people feel about your store if theres alot of stress going on in their head.

The text states that " Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them ".

Which means it helps them com alive in the real world.

If your sad and was to put on a happy face it would probably help you get happy or to get a better attuide for the day. In this story it says a " Drama couch, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emothions on stage" to better them when they had to come on stage infront of people to peform. The actors had to make it come real for people to enjoy it. He would also put them in other peoples life to see what there emotional state was and how they were feeling.

The muscles are called " orbicularis oculi par palpabraeus" these muscles are acting when you get mad,sad,happy,frustrated and other emotions. So yes, i think you should have this in the world to see what people are feeling around you . It can do what computers can do . Like if you were to smile at a ad they could bring it up to make you even more happy or to get you to buy something. If you were to frown you would get a ad to help you smile or to laught.

It can also perdict when a student is bored of a topic. these are my reasons why I feel this way about this.
