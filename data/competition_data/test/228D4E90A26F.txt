In this article the author talks about how exploring

Venus would be a great discovery to pursue.

The author talks about how going to

Venus can be done.

In the article theres a lot of information can help humanity get to planet

Venus.

Most of what he's talking about is evidence that can help scientists get people to

Venus.

He covers everything it would take to get to

Venus.

I feel that most of the things he is talking about is true and if we do what is needed to get us there, then we can land and discover new things.

The first thing that the author wrote about getting to

Venus was how

"Venus was just around the corner".

Meaning that flying to

Venus was no problem, although we would have to improve on something.

By doing this we could get there more faster.

They have tested a material called

"silicon carbide"

and lasted about 2

weeks in the hot

Venus planet.

Scientists are expiermenting this materail and could possiblily use it to create a strong spaceship from it.

Theres a lot more that could be used from this article.

As far as we know we still need a lot more to research.

If we can find more evidence like perhaps figureing out what we need to research once we get to

Venus.

We know what we need to get there. By doing these steps we can discover a whole new planet.

I know that the author's thoughts about all this is true.
