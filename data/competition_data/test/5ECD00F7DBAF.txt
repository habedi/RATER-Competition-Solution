Saying that each student is able to learn the same is like saying that all animals are able to get from one place to another the same. It's not always possible. Fish swim, snakes slither, and birds fly. All are trying to accomplish the same thing, the only difference is each have a unique way of doing so. Now, if each animal were all of a sudden made to travel the same, how successful each animal is in completing this task would be up for debate. With that being said, one could begin to question weather or not students should have the option of attending classes from home or at school. Though some may believe otherwise, life circumstances, several personal reasons, and distractions prove that students should be permitted to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

Some students have challenges in their lives that may withhold them from performing well in a traditional classroom setting. An example of a situation like this would be a student that has a child to take care of. Perhaps this student has no one to watch his or her child while they are at school. Being able to take their classes virtually, from home, could assist this student substantially by allowing him or her to physically be with their child and still get the same education as any other student. It could be said that in instances like the one mentioned, taking classes at home could become an impediment to one's learning. Though, being home may serve as piece of mind for this student, and could even better their academic performance. One never truly knows what another is going through, not to mention would could effect them positively or not.

There are several personal issues that could prevent certain students from retaining curriculum in school well. For instance, not being comfortable around other students. This could be because of bullying, fear of germs, etc. For whatever exceptional reason there is, this student doesn't perform well in a traditional classroom setting. In this case, completing their classes from the comfort of their home could be a solution. One could argue that allowing a student in this circumstance to change their setting of learning could have negative effect on things like social skills in the future. Though, what may come across as a necessity to one may not be as important to another individual, especially if a decision due to this is being made by someone that won't be effected by the choice made. Every students' experiences in school are different.

For some students, being physically in school could be a distraction to them. An example of such would be a student who has a boyfriend or girlfriend they got to school with. This boyfriend or girlfriend could be in the majority of this students' classes, unintentionally distracting this student, and causing their performance in school to decline. In a situation like the one presented, attending classes from home could most definitely be a positive alternative. Some may say that a student like this could just as easily be distracted by being at home, as a result of lack of structure. Though, one cannot categorize a student in such a way due to the mere fact that all students respond to certain situations differently.

In conclusion, students would truly benefit from having the option of taking classes from home or not because of different life standards, personal hardships, and multiple distractions. The one thing that each of these reasons have in common are that the people potentially dealing with them are not, in fact, common. Each individual is unique in their own way, which is what makes them so special. Ultimately, everyone is trying to do the same thing, live. The only difference is each individuals approach. This is why it's important that one is not only conscious, but accepting of another's differences.
