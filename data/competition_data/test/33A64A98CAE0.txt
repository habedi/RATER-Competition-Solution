Dear principal,

I think students should be required to do community service acts for bad behavior, disrespect and misconduct. I feel that the students who are irresponsible and disrespectful should learn to control themselves by doing community service and i think this will also teach them their lesson so they will behave. Another thing is that i do not feel its okay to have everyone do community service because if you can control you actions you shouldn't be punished. Also if a student is not doing well in school they should be able to do community service for extra credit or just so they have another helpful act to put on an applications for jobs, schools and more.

I think if a student gets caught fighting or bullying others they should do a service act that has to do with people, or if they get caught stealing they should do something for a charity event, or if they get caught littering they should go gather up all of the trash from some place like the park, road-side, or near by pond.

If the student should refuse their assigned act i think the student should be suspended for a day. then when they return they should give a hand-written or oral apology to whoever the act of misconduct was committed toward.
