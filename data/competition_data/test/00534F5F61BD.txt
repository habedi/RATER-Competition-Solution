Scientists believe that Venus could sustain human life. According to the article, "Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels." Therefore, human life is possible on Venus. But not without some difficulties.

The conditions on Venus are extremely dangerous. According to the article, "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." Conditions like this include erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

Overall, human life is possible on Venus. Not easy, but possible. According to the article, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." The possible knowledge that could be obtained about Venus and the fact that Venus might be able to support human life are both very big reasons that scientists want to study Venus.
