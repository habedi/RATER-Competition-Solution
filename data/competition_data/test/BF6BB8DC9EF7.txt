Should schools require students to do summer projects? Well I agree with this topic because, some students would want to require better learning experiences that would help them figure out ideas in the future to come; but instead of letting teachers decide we as students should be able to come up with ideas that would fit in with our learning pace. As students we would have more time to figure out everything we need in order to make a good project. Student decisions is made for a summer project.

As students we can talk about what we have learned in class or even at home. Making a project about nature is something you can create for your science class next school year. We would be able to show off our skills as a team in order to let the true leadership come out of everyone. We should be able to partner up with someone that is determined to learn. Doing a summer project on something you done in class would help the most because mainly we already know what we have worked on; but instead of copying basically what you know you be creative. Working as a team isnt easy or hard it will come to you if only we put our minds into it.

Some schools have teachers that want students to better themselves for a purpose. Teachers are settings students up for if there going to college. College isnt made for everyone, some colleges give projects that have to be turned in at a certain point of time. Like writing essays or doing group activity projects. While your in school teachers want you to better yourselves to be someone that you want to be in life. You dont necessarily have to have an poster project, teachers can give you projects that doesnt deal with school it'll just better our community. Projects arent always on paper it can be something else if you or the teacher ant it to be.

Being able to learn during a summer break is hard, because we as children would probably have something to do, like family trips, field trips, and etc.. But if learning is something that is accomplished on its own. We can come up with projects on our own, we can be out of state and take pictures of something that fascinates us and than we could put it on a poster, or even a presentation. Being able to come to school from summer break starting a whole new year, you could talk about the amazing things you saw in a sideshow. Not knowing that we are doing a project basically everyday, it's basically life. Projects can come in many forms, but being able to do them as a team would make it more fun for school and the summer.

While teachers teach and students learn, students should be able to learn on there own at some point. Teacher dont always have to give us work on there topic we should be able to come up with some good ideas that'll be creative in the learning environment. This is why I agree with students should be able to make there own decisions.
