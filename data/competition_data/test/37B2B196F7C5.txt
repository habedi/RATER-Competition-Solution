A lot of kids enjoy extracurricular activity,I argree with the decision because some kids might like to be in extra stuff to become a better student and for themselves. Kids need extracurricular activity, A lot of kids brains are not all the way devolved yet so there for they can't think like an adult. Most kids play sports and things and some kids just sit and play games and watch TV all day long. Think about if they see what the good kids are doing and see them doing extra work they might follow behind the bigger person and get their work done. The principal is right for extracurricular activity so we can become better and would get out and do more stuff.

Some kids think when they hear the word extra thats its going to be a lot of work when it might not be and they are to lazy to get up and do something,plus to try and put in work. Some kids need the work to become a better child instead of getting older and not knowing what to do. When you get use to being a lazy child it goes into you adult hood and you become more and more lazier and don't want to go and get a job to be able to feed yourself. You might have a family thats hungry and you might need to go out and do a extra thing to get food. The person will remember,when you was in school and didn't want to do the extra activity and it will mass with your mind.

A child would probably think the same way, but sometimes you might need to handle yo business even if you dont want to do it. extracurricular activity doesnt have to be work it could be anything like,camps,helping the homeless,donating money. Some people might need to get use to extra stuff cause when the kids get older they are going to want to be able to be smart and be able to read. sometimes you never know what can help with your life so gotta make it count. Some kids might think it's dumb but i think its good to be on a higher level you could even get a good grade for it.

To be a kid at this school its a good school,Im pretty sure that the principal wants the kids to be great coming into a huge world, so to be able to do that we will have to take reasobilty. I want extracurricular activity because you can learn a lot of stuff in a little period of time. When its extra work or an activity take it cause in the long run you wont regret it. Its the first time the principal has wanted this for the school and its property for a reason,If you not good with decisions this should be a good one. Sometimes you can tell your best friend to make u want to do it so they can with you. a lot of people went on their own like me i decided to go and i was not even bad.
