Summer assignments are a component of school that is required by many classes, so that the student can be ready for their classes for next year. This has brought up the idea to see if students or teachers should make these assignments over the summer. The benefits of a teacher made assignment would be that he or she is very knowledgeable in the field of study and can easily make the summer assignment without any hesitations ,however, the student made assignments would be overall better as it gives them the opportunity to research more into the subjects there are going to take, will be much more enjoyable to do than the one made by teachers as many of them require you to spend days working on them, and it will give the student more time to spend on other activities over the summer like a summer job. This would be the best as it give the students more freedom over there work during the summer. How would making there own assignment benefit Students? some may ask.

Well it would give the student a chance to dive in on the subject and truly learn what they are going to be covering over the course of the year. This in turn will make these classes easier to teach as many of the students have already done the summer assignments and have had further research into the subject, which can lower the work load on teachers as these students who have done their work, and can spread there wisdom down to others who may not have done as much research into the subject on hand. Classes will also be more engaging,as the students can answer various subject question with ease because of there time spent on there work over the summer. This also may get them more enthusiastic of the subject as it may correspond into the field of work they want to go into the future which, gives them more preparations for these sort of things. Although many may believe this could cause a distraction for the students, as they could ignore their work and go and insted have fun and play over the summer. This could also be the case for teacher made assignments as many students dislike to do school work over the summer. this ,however, will be more fun and engaging as they are making it on there own and will have time to truly go into the subjects they may struggle in while they may not put as much work into the subjects they are more confident in. Overall this would help student preform better in classes as they have the tool of the internet which has many tools that can help them improve on there subject that they are more worried about. This will also be more fun as the student does not have to worry about an assignment that was teacher given as they have made the subjects they want to focus on more.

The enjoyment of the student should be taking into consideration when making summer assignments as many teachers have neglected this fact. Which has caused many to just not do it for example assignments like: reading a book, a math packet, and history project these sort of assignments for many are not fun at all and dont give them much value as they will forget what they have learned through these very quickly as they have a negative memory with them. this can be solved by letting the student make them as they will have a fonder memory of it as they put in the blood and sweet to prepare for these classes instead of a teacher who may have just given them an assignment that could take to long to finish. Students need time to work and play over the summer to relax themselves from all the school work they had to deal with over the many grueling school days. The other problem that students deal with that can be solved easily is work time.

To many this may be trivial to many of the student body this is very important as some us have to work over the summer to help out our families or just to make some money to buy. This is a huge problem that many teachers overlook as they complain by saying " You had the whole summer to work on it". For some of us we need the summer to work on other things not just school work we want time to enjoy our selves and work and we are stripped of these by teacher assigned work. If students made these assignments they make it so that they have more than enough time to complete there work in a fashionable manner and can plane ahead for the upcoming classes. Time is very important to many as it could be the difference of making money or losing it because your stuck at home working on a summer assignment instead of working so you can help your family pay the rent. Without the Summer many students family may be struggling as school of during the summer was made for students to work and help out in there families farms. And many still to do to this day use summer for that reason. Overall student made summer projects would be much better as it would give them the time them selves on there own pace and they would retain more information about the subject and it would be overall more fun for them.

In conclusion, Summer assignments should only be given if they are student made as it has much more benefits than the ones that are made by teachers. As it gives them more time to work and balance their time around their schedules. And gives them an oppurtinty to retain more information as they are the ones who have looked into it and have done a lot of research on there subject. Also gives them some leeway to have more fun as they can their summer assignments more engaging for themselves and have more time to spend on themselves. Overall student made summer assignments are much better then teacher assignments and should be consider for when they are assigning summer projects.
