In my opinion, I think that this technolgy in this story can read emotional expressions. It says in the story: "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the falce all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". Dr. Hunang says that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal".

The technology from this story and the technology in our present time is way different then in this story in our real world the technolgy has changed in many different ways having phones that track where you are and what your location is. The Phones, computers, and tablets have really changed over the past few years. Although in this story you are talking about mona lisa and what there technology consits of. In our era now we have 3D and 4D printers that you can print projects and other things from. In the story it says it scans mona lisa's face and tells whether she is mad or angry and a whole bunch of emotions and other things that go on during the scan. But you can proably tell how your friend or a person is feeling by the look on him or her's face. Computers are really changing alot on what processor it has in it and a bunch of new features added to the computer each year. Meanwhile, in the story it says by moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but it also may even help produce emotions.

In conclusion, I explained whether the use of this technolgy in this reading to explain the emotional expresssions of students in a classroom.
