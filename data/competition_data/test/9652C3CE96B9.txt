While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. It's important that if we study about venus because it help us to know about happed in the world and it help us to know where the sun come from without the sun we won't be able to live long, and it's important to know about the earth. The venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study despite its proximity. In the text paragraph 8 it said "the venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally in intimidate endeavors. Venus is the closest planet to earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth,venus, and mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. Because venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud drapped world. Today, venus still has some features that are anlogous to thoses on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters.
