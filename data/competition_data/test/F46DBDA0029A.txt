The Seagoing Cowboys Program is giving you an opportunity of a life time and I think you should join becuase you would be helping many people who's countries were left in ruins because of World War II and those people need food supplies,animals and more. You would also take care of cows,horses,and mules.

To get to work for the Seagoing Cowboys Program would be amazing because you wold travel to many different countries. Say like Europe and China and could travel to Greece and see the Acropolis, take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,on the streets of water.

The trip would also be great beacuse you would find some fun stuff do while you're on the boat, like boxing, fencing, baseball, and tennis ball tournaments. But beaing a Seagoing Cowboy is more than just an adventure and plaing games its about helping people and other countries. So I hope you say yes because this trip could open up the world to you, and you could be grateful for the opportunity of this trip.
