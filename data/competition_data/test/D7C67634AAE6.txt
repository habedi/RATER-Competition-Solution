Venus, sometimes called the evening star. Also referred as Earth's twin. Visiting Vanus is a challenge for humans to study. The cloud-draped world would be instering to see. Calling it earths twin can make be an over statement. Venus seems like the opposite of earth.

Even though Earth's twin Venus is the closest planet in terms to density and size. The closest in distance too. Venus ha a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Making it more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive acid in venus's atmosphere. Which these condition can be every dangerous for humans. Environment would crush a submarine.

Can be every hot actually the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system. Thirty milies plus above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees.

Desite all the challenges Venus has, the information is every interesting. Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The planet Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus has some features that are same to Earth today.

So going to Venus could be worth going to because of the things it had. Also it was just like Earth so who knows one day Earth could end up just like Venus in the furture. Visiting Venus could help humans better understand the furture Earth.
