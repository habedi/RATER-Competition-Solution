Do you like driving? If you do you may want to look into some of these new driving restrictions. In places like Germany, Paris, Bogota, and even in the United States people are driving a lot less. In other countries driving is partially banned. For instance in Bogota driving was banned for one day. Many said it was a relaxation and even a stress reliever.

Driving you car less can help many things in multiple ways, such as the environment or even people. The more we drive the more we hurt the environment. Places like Vauban, Germany have expensive parking spaces and if you want to drive then you must buy the parking space that cost $40,000. These spaces are at the edge of the city and you must walk home if you must have a car.

In the United States we have been buying less cars ever since 2005. In 2005 we hit our driving peak when we had sold most cars and were driving the most. Now that we are in 2015 less people are even getting their license. "As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak." Sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. "A recent study found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."

In Paris they banned drivng due to smog. They had near-record pollution, so they decided to ban driving. This was only a partial ban but it still had a big impact. "On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine." Then the same would apply to odd-numbered plates the next day. Congestion was down 60 percent after five days of starting this partial ban.

In conclusion if we start driving less we will be less stressed and will be doing good for the environment. At the rate we are driving less we will be doing many good things for the environment and for other peopleas well.
