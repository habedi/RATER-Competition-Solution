Everyone has their good times and their bad showing many mixed emotions. People will show emotions, and sometimes they wont. There are so many emotions; bored, happy, sad, angry, confused, scared, and your telling me that this "Facial Action Coding System" can detect them all? Putting "technology to read the emotional expressions of a student" is a big NO. Even at times we don't know how we feel, how can a computer tell us what we feel.

These computers being able to identify human emotions is scary if you think about it. Over the pass ten years the interenet has become a real popular thing. People use it to socialize and play game, but what happens when someone loses in a game or doesnt agree with what someone else is saying. We have a reaction thats not exspected. People can be very agressive verbaly through the interent. Because of the interent there have been more suisides now then there has ever been. Knowing how you feel could increase the risk of suside and/or thoughts of suiside considering over half of the worlds population has depression. (which can lead to suiside)

Even if this "Facial Action Coding System" can detect our feelings what actions are going to be taken. Even though "Alto" did say "A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."

They didn't give any imformation on how they are going to do that. It sounds like when they say "like an effective human instuctor" they are refering to a robot which has no expresion in its voice. That would make someone not pay attention even more the voice would be very boring causing the student to doze off even more.

Sometimes Schools are more poor then other and have no way of paying for computers. This softwear "Facial Action Coding System" could cost money they never adressed cost in the article. This would also be something that the teacher and students would have to adapt to as well. Where just now getting laptops and Ipads into schools to "better push education." I read a study over E-Learning vs Paper. They took a group of students of the same grade level, and split them into two groups. Gave them both the same exact passage with the same exact questions, but one was all on the computer while the other one is on paper. When the results came back from both groups more kids on paper did better. Not only do kids learn better using paper we save money from having to buy computers that may have been broken or damaged.

People need to experince all of these different kinds of emotions to be able to handle these experinces. Without these experinces when something where to happen we wouldnt be able to handle it. If we continue with using "Facial Action Coding System"

Suiside rates could go up. Using this in classroom could also make students get less infomration by not being able to focus on what's being tought to them.

Not everyone lives in the riches places would this program be able to be funded to schools or pay through the goverment.

This is somthing that we should not go on forward with because doing so may make us suffer the effects of the future causing the people of our future to be looked down upon.
