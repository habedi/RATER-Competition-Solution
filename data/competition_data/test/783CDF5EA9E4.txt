Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think only bad kids should have to do community service.

Why I think this is because bad kids use there free time to do bad things and make bad choices.

Good kids, like myself, wont do bad stuff with there free time.

We good kids have sport events to attend to and homework, plus lots of other things to deal with.

If the bad kids tried to do sports, they would get kicked out for doing bad stuff. And if they were a bad kid they wouldn't do there homework either.

That is why they should have things for bad kids to do in there free time so they wont get into trouble.

If you make everyone do community service then we wouldn't have enough time to do anything.

Our community will get cleaned up, but we need some time to relax and to do other out of school activities, and sense we use our free time to do good stuff and the bad kids don't they should do it.

The bad kids get into so much trouble.

They should use it as punishment, so the bad kids would hate getting into trouble.

That is why I think that bad kids should do the community service.

Love,
