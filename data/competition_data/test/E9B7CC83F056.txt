I don't think the use of technoloy to read emotional expressions of students in aclassroom is a valuable. I don't think that is fair to students because some people want to keep their emotions to theirselves. There are many reasons people want to keep their emotions to themselves. They don't want any one knowing their emotions.

I think if there was technology reading your emotional expressions,it would distract students from learning and getting good grades. Some kids might think it really cool that a computer can read your emotions,others might not think it is so cool. Some kids might get to focused on the computer reading their emotions or get too worried that the computer is going to share their emotions to other people on the internet. I think your emotions are private and should be kept to yourselve. I think kids should not be distracted by learning because a computer thet can read your emotional expressions should not be put in a classroom.

I don't think having technology that reads your emotional expressions is right. Some people might think that is cool,but others might not because maybe they don't want their expression read. I think parents might not agreee with a computer that can read your emotions in a classroom,because they want their child to succeed and not be distracting from learning by technology. I don't think we should allow technology that reads your emotions in a classroom so kids can learn and not be distracted and get a good education,so they can graduate school.
