Summer break the longest break during the year from school. this is the time you decompress and forget everything you learned from the year prior before your head gets crammed with more information. requiring students to complete summer activities would help students keep all of the information from the prior year in their brain to give them a better chance to have a better start to the next school year. These summer assignments should be teacher-designed to promote better learning conditions.

Teacher designed summer activities would help students in the long run. this would keep their brain thinking and remembering the curriculum from the previous school year. A teacher could design a summer project that would help reinforce what the students learned. the teacher could use projects like a book report or a lab report on a experiment students would have to complete over the summer. a teacher designed project would insure maximum learning is still happening outside of the school environment. This would support the students learning for the next school year by keeping the brain thinking about the information and not to forget it.

One of the biggest problems in school today is that students come back from winter break and have forgotten all of the things that they learned the prior year. Teachers could assign projects that must be completed for a grade in the next school year to ensure students completed this activity. teachers would have the ability to help students over the summer by way of internet learning.

This would give students a way to still ask the teachers questions and get help on assignments while they are working over the summer. if the teacher assigned a project like a science project or experiment the student would still be able to reach out to the teacher and get directions from them. They could also make lessons in videos that that the students would be able to watch and help as a review for what they learned in the prior year.

On the other side of the table students would absolutely hate the idea of having to do school work on their summer break. The summer break is when students get to decompress hang out with friends and family. This would also make a problem for families trying to go on vacation. Summer activities could also be made by students which would make them more exciting and make the students want to complete it more. Students could create assignments that would interest them and they could make them group work so that the students could work together with their friends. This could positively benefit the students in the long run but this would most likely require schools to give every student a personal laptop which some school districts cant afford.

Having students complete summer activities that are teacher made would help the students remember what they learned in the prior year. This would help students retain more information than if they just had a whole summer off with no work. Studetns would hate this because they just want to have the summer away from school but teacher made assignements would help students in the long run. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed to promote better learning conditions.
