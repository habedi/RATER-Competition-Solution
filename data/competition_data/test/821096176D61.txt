Dear Principle,

I think that community service should be required because of many reasons. First of all students have to find a way to help the community even if its helping elderly people or cleaning up litter. They should know that if we put something in something will come out so that means that if they do good things for their community, the community will give good things back. Such as if a student goes to apply to Dartmouth with a GPA of 3.8 but he did not do anything to help his community or did many sports, but then theirs another student who has a GPA of 3.2 but has helped his community a lot and has participated in many sports. Who would you think the university will pick for a spot? Also, people think that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do, and that is wrong because when you are helping people it is not wasting time because you are doing something that helps influence and the people around you.

To help a community you have to have something inside of you that is called "Compassion" because you are showing compassion when you go and help the elderly women plow that snow from her yard, you are showing compassion when you go and help that man bring his things inside his house, you are showing compassion when you go pick up that wrapper off the floor to take less work from that janitor. So in my case I think that community service should be required because it affects the way you look toward something and will help less teenagers become less violent because they are doing stuff that helps the community and they are having fun which is better that going to go take drugs on the streets.

Another reason that i think that community service should be require because imagine if one person can make a difference by planting that plant, imagine what thousands of kids can do. They could help elderly people, pick up trash, tutor those kids who need special education or just need a tutor. Most of the teenagers could do this and much more. Also our city is turning into a very hostile city and there is killing everywhere, if we could bring all of the teenagers together and make them do something to help the community they would see that here is hope in their future and they could stop doing bad things and start doing good things

So in conclusion I think that the principle should require all of the students to do community service because if we put something in something will come out so that means that if they do good things for their community, the community will give good things back. Also, people think that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do, and that is wrong because when you are helping people it is not wasting time because you are doing something that helps influence and the people around you. So teenagers need something to influence their lives in a good way rather than just sitting around at home playing video games . It is also a good way for them to entertain themselves and if one "cool" kid from school does community service it will influence other kids to do community service just to be cool and they could finally get up and do something for their community.

Sincerely,
