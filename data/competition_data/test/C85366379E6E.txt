Despite laws against it nearly 90% of Americans still use their phones while driving. This being said phones should not and are not supposed to be used while driving. Smart phones have made it simple to stay connected at all times, but behind the wheel should not be one of those times. According to DMV.org texting and driving is the leading cause of death in teens. When you decide to do anything on your phone while driving you are putting more value on what you are doing instead of the lives around you. The act of being on a phone while driving is not only illegal, but also poses a distraction and puts you and others in danger.

At least 9 people are killed every day because of a distracted driver (DMV.org). When you are using you phone well driving it incorporates all 3 types of driving distractions. One being visual: takes your eyes off the road. Sometimes you can look at more than one thing at a time, but the road and phone are not included. Trying to send a text while driving is like trying to read a book and walk. The next type of distraction is manual: taking your hands off the wheel. Typing calls for two hands most of the time and driving calls for two hand, so unfortunately we only have two to give and I promise driving is the better option. The last type of distraction is cognitive: takes your focus away from driving. Most people have taken their eyes off the road to look at a cow or something of that nature and realized something bad almost happened and that is just a split second. Now imagine doing this at 55mph taking your eyes off to read a text, and reading takes a bit more concentration than just looking at a cow.

In addition to texting and driving being a distraction it is also illegal. A large number of U.S. states have passed law corresponding to this danger. Penalties for breaking these laws include: fines, license suspension, raise in auto insurance, and prison time. Do you really what to have on your chest the thought of you killing a father, mother, son, daughter just because you could wait to send a text? If you think about it the penalties are given to people who actually commit crimes. Do you want to do in the same category as a rapist? All of this because you couldn't put your phone up to get from point A to point B.

These penalties are the same as ones you get for a DUI. Thus meaning when you text and drive you are just as dangerous as an intoxicated driver. Driving with a BAC of just 0.01% increases your chances of causing a car crash by 46%, according to a 2014 study. If you'd never drive drunk why would you ever text and drive. Also According to the NHTSA texting and driving is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. Texting and driving is just as bad as drinking 2 beers. If you see how bad drunk driving accidents are why would you want to put yourself and others in the same situation just for a text?

In a word being distracted while driving is among the top most dangerous things you can do on the road. This is a bad habit to have but habits can be broken. Working on it now can save you and others from a world of pain and suffering later. There is no point in paying fines and jail time or even possibly killing somebody or yourself for a text. So next time you think about picking up a phone think again and put it down.
