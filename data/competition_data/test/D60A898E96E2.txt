Electoral College is loosing potential voters and making everything extremly difficult and unfair!

Small states most likley have the most potenital and smartest voters and they just get left there. No canidates go and visit and talk about the presidental run. They just think they'll get there votes. All they care about is the big states. Then the popular votes may not even count because of the Electoial College. It's insane and disrepectful! I mean, yeah, big states have alot of people but its unfair for the little states to be told nothing and see nothing and then go vote for someone they barley know anything about.

Sometimes the popular votes dont even help with winning. What's the point? Exactly, there isn't one. Wouldn't you rather see someone people want as president instead of someone who won just because the Electoial College. I sure would and so would a bunch of other people.

The Electoral College is unfair on the most basic level to voters because of the "winner-takes-all system", only caring about the "swing" states. In 2000 seventeen states didn't see any of the canidates at all. That's just crazy and dumb! Every state should see the canidates even if it's the small states.

The arguements to keep the Electoral College are mostly assertins with out much basis in reality and the ones that are against are the best arguements with great facts and it's reality. Ohip have yet to make a swing vote. In 1997, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio abd 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The single best argument against the electoial collefe is what we might call the disaster factor. The american people shopidl consider themselves lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest electon crisis in the century; the system allows fior so much worst to happnened.

Most states have the "Winner take all system" except Maine and Nebraska, they each have variation of "Poportional Represnation." Why go through all the work of trying to get popular votes, and have them not help at all.

I say we vote with popular votes because everyone wants to see the people that is more popular then someone who only won because of the Electorial Vote!
