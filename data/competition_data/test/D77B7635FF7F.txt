Dear Principal,

Well to start with, i personally would love for us to do community service. But i also know that a lot of other students may not. But i think students should be required to have community service. There are always ways to make things fun!

For example ... painting over the graffiti, i mean come on who doesn't like to paint. This is one way you cane have fun while helping out your community. Another way is to read with younger kids. You never know they could pick out a book you have never even read and you may think it is hilarious, and on the bright side you could be having a blast while helping out. And i don't know about you but to me those are some awesome ways to help the community. And that is only two of the millions of fun ways we can have fun while doing community service.

And if some students say "This is a waist of my time i could be doing better things." Well to be honest kids now in the earlier generation are getting involved with drugs, gangs, violence, ext. and to me this is a way to keep them away from that. Doing this community service could help open the eyes of some people and show them they can help make a difference, in today's education, and enrolment. they just need to start small and pretty soon this will rub off to others and our world will be a better place.

Also if we do community service other people might see how helpful this is and also want to get involve. Including the younger kids and this may help our change our chances for a better community in the feature.

So yeah of course i think we should be required to do community service, because we are helping our world. And I'm pretty sure a lot of other students will like it once they try it!!!!!!!

yours truly,
