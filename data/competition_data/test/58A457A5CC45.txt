Dear Principal,

I believe students should be required to perform community service. There are various benefits with students completing this task. For example, with students performing community service in can make this a better society. Various tasks can be completed. students can pick litter up around the community and make a cleaner and healthier place to live in. Making this change can really benefit the entire community.

this community and its people can really make change in the environment. students can also help the young and tutor them. not can it only help the little ones but out can also save time for the teachers. other volunteer work can be fedding the hungry ia soup kitchen or donating food to them. in the communiy eldery people can also use help. students can help the eldely with stuff they cant do foe themselves. another tasks can be painting over the graffiti in the street walls. students can spend their time helping the communits and not on the street.

this change can really help and benefit the community .so please consider rthe idea.

sicerly, STUDENT_NAME.
