Should students be forced to do extracurricular activities? I personally believe to do so because the activities can help you in many ways and get you friends. You only have to do at least one activity so you can choose the one that mostly interests you.

First,extracurricular activities can benefit you if you don't have friends or don't have a social life because can help you make a friend in it. You can make friends in these activities for example, Basketball. In Basketball, if your team wins and you guys are happy, your team can talk about things they do after school and share hobbies and interests. If you share theses hobbies, you can get a friend who has the same interests at you. Having a friend in these activities in these classes so you can enjoy it more and not be lonely anymore. Even after the activities and school, you guys can meet up any time at your and their house and be outside and hangaround. Lastly, a friend is important to have, but in a extracurricular activity, it makes it more fun and enjoyable.

Second, some activities can help you in the real world by learning new skills. For example, fashion, sports, and art. For fashion, people can do the activity if they are interested in designing clothes or have a passion for fashion. Basketball can be an area of growth of a person who wants to be good at it, same with other sports. Art can be the most useful thing to learn skills in my opinion because you can learn how to be an artist. People who take art class want to improve at being good and could make a career out of it to make money.

Lastly, I think it's good to force at least one activity to get the benefits, but there are still some cons. People may not be interested because they don't like any of the activities and it can waste time to getting home and less chance to do work. To compare the pros are better because it can change your view on something. In the beginning you would be like "Soccer is trash", but afterwards you can be like "Soccer is fun" if you gave it a chance. Overall, extracurricular activities are helpful and enjoyable to kids.
