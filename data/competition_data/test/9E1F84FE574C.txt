"The Challenge of Exploring Venus"

In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author explains the dangers of exploring our sister planet, but he also explains why we should. The article gives that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky but also unable to land on being that it is covered in a thick atomsphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide and covered in sulfuric acid clouds. He explains how "striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because human curisoity will likely lead us to into many equally intimidating endeavors." The pursuit of traveling to Venus is worth it since the knowledge that we'd gain and could possiably lead to other greater discoveries is to great to pass up.

The author explains the risk that apporach in traveling to Venus such as "the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomshpere..." If we were to take the challenge to travel,we have a possiablily of getting samples such as rocks and dirt and even the smallest bit will help our knowledge of our sister planet. The author also states "... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." But the author provides us with ways to aviod this problem by creating a "blimp-like vechicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape." Proving that those who we'd send would be able to study but also protected from the planets sulferic acid clouds.

The pursuit of traveling to Venus is worth it since the knowledge that we'd gain and could possiably lead to other greater discoveries is to great to pass up. Though the dangers of the travel,we will have multipule opporutinites to gain insight on the planet. Which we many one day successfully live on with the knowledge collected if we choose the make this journey.
