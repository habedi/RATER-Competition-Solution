Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years because almost everyone who drives has one. Cell phones are use in cars more than there suppose to. In my opinion you shouldn't be able to use cell phones in a car and heres why.

1 reason drivers should not be able to use a cell phone is because they want pay attention to the road and they could hit another car or even a person. Also if drivers don't use a cell phone why there driving they can make it to there destination safe and they can get on it when there done driving. Drivers who use cell phones put a lot of people in danger cause there not checking there surroundings and pay more attention to there phone then the road.

A lot of car crashes are caused by cell phones because people are always on them. Also when people are driving they should put there phone on do not disturbe or in driving safety mode until there out the car. If drivers did that there would be less crashes and we wouldn't have to worry about cell phones.

There would be less crashes if people didn't have a cell phone in a car because the driver would be focused not only on the road but focused on there surroundings to. Cell phones make a huge different in the car then not in the car and people should juss forget about them till there done driving.
