community service

I think they should let the kids do what they want. i think if they might say they have something to do they could. some other kids might say they cant because they have something to do but they really don't. i think its nice if they do community service to help out or other kids. i think other kids should maybe do community service to help other people and they could do it to help other kids how to read or something. maybe some other kids already have other stuff planned and some of them might think they have to do other stuff and but they really want to help out. i think if other students help clean up litter that is a good thing.

I think other kids should try to help out and not try to make stuff up and help. some other people care than others and they will help out but i don't think they should get forced to do it and help out. if other people could take some of there time after school or something i think that would be a good thing to do.

Other kids or people might not like being around other people like that and some other people could be fine with that. sometimes people don't like that because maybe grown up like that and it bothers them to be around other people.
