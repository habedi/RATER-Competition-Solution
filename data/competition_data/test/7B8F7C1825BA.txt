The idea of letting kids take classes at home is not a great idea. Not only would students hate more technology based education causing them pain in the eyes, but they would have no one to talk to at home. No friends, no classmate, just at home by themselves.

There should be another option for this. some students would not be comfortable with the idea of someone teaching them in there house. What if there was an outage of electricity, the student would go a whole week without learning causing them to forget the knowledge they leaned last week.

I also wounder if the school would provide the right equipment for the student. Including a monitor, headset, or a chair. I know students, as my self could not afford a $200 monitor. lets say there is a family with 5 children. That would mean 5 monitors, 5 chairs, 5 headsets, and 5 rooms. Or they can share but that would cut into the other persons learning time.

Another reason why school should not be at home is the fact that schools would be empty. so many students would try to stay at home that teachers would be jobless, the kitchen staff would be jobless. so much unemployment would have a huge damage on the economy. I think there should be an option for the parents, can they afford there kids to stay home, can they be trusted that they will get up and turn on that screen or take a shower once in a while

Education isnt meant for it to be taught at home its meant to have a one on one conversation with a teacher, it is meant to help a child grow and to face real life experiences like talking in a group, giving a presentation, or reading body language. In conclusion there should not be any school at home.
