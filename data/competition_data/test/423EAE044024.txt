Having a summer project to do may seem like a bad thing byt what if you got to choose the project you wanted to do or would you let the teacher choose, these summer projects should be givien by teachers.

The teachers would know what projects and what to expects from certain kids. While knowing what kids she has she would not give the kids to mush work or to little work. Then from there on the teacher would give the right amount of work to the kids so they can still be ready for school but also have fun on their vacation. As of this choice is the students decide to do it or not it won't harm the teacher, but for the kids that do it they might have a extra credit put in or maybe even help them pass a class.

More reasons for teachers to assign these projects would be, cause the have more time on their hands.

Students get out before the teachers and teachers still have to work extra few days for planning for stuff. When they do this they can take some extra hours to make this project depening on the subjects they are doing and what they are doing it might take a while, but they can get it over as soon as possible. The teachers that already do summer programs could also help with making, creating, and grading the projects and the teachers would probably get it done in enough time for the student to finish

While on the aother hand;, students may think that if they go tot plan it that it wouldbe alot better. Students wouldt attempt to probably cheat and get veryone the same project ao that they all can do it together.

The kids would not take their own project that serious seeing that most kids barely take school seriously. Student would make short little projects about what they did for summer or something tghey wouldn't really pick something that would keep them educated out of school. They wouldn't really care about something they have a choice for they wouldn't taoke it serious. Teachers will get it done in enough times; on ther other hand the stiudents might not, also some students may have a different influence on other students but some may not so they might not like the projects that they get given to them by certain student. Students will listen to their own teachers but the only problem is will they do it.

In conclusion, teachers should create these sumer projects instead of students cause they are actually going to make them educated and well-shared; while on the other hand students don't have the same influence as teachers.
