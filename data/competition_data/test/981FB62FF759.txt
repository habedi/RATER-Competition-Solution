Are you very active after school? Do you participate in extracurricular activities? I think all student should participate in extracurricular activities. I agree with our principal's decision he made on making every student participate in an extracurricular activitie because it allows them to get out more, make new friends, and they are able to support their school.

First of all students must join these activities because it allows them to get out more. Everyday now you see a bunch of kids playing video games, talking about how awesome they are, or even blowing money on them. Pushing the student to join school clubs or a sports team will take them away from those games. On the other hand, some kids don't have things to do after school. They just go home sit down and do nothing. If they join an activity they can have more fun after school. Trust me, as I have had some personal experience, it is not fun to be at home and have nothing fun to do. Also, as time goes on scientists have noticed that child obesity has increased as well. They need to stay active The after school sports are there to help those numbers go down.

Secondly, little ones can make new friends in after school programs. If they make new friends they won't be lonely anymore. For example, some kids are the only child. Yeah, I get it, that sounds amazing in a child's perspective, but it is always more fun to do something with a friend. If they don't have those friends, then they will be doing everything by themselves. Also, if a child is having problems at home or struggling with something in life, joining their new friend in a school activity will help them keep their mind off of it. Adding on to what I just stated, kids like to hide their emotions and tell everyone everything is alright when sometimes it really isn't. If children make new friends, then they will have someone to vent off of and let everything out. Once they do talk to them, then there will be someone right there to help them.

Finally, students can help support their school. Schools have many things to do throughout the year and very little time to do it. Joining council clubs or yearbook clubs will help the school get things done that are needed. Additionally, athletes can represent their school in a team sport that they like. To specify, at my high school football is a big thing. Many people love the game. The kids at the high school represent their school when they play good in their games. This will get your school out there and well known. Finally, kids can make their school a better place. Many clubs like to support many subjects like no bullying, or don't do drugs. If more and more kids join a club that thinks this way kids will start listening and making the school a safer and glorious place.

As I have stated, allowing students to get out more, make new friends, and helping support their school are all reasons students need to join an after school activity. I agree with our principal. After school programs are definitely worth a shot at trying out. Plus, it doesn't take a lot to participate in an activity, so get out their and join a club or a sports team now!
