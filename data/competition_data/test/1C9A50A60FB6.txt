Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should allow the students to bring their phone to school as long as they are turned off during class and can be used during free time and lunch time. I think this is a better policy than banning phones from school. If you banned phones from school some of the students will probably try to sneak phones in and try to text during class. Then your just stressing yourself about whether or not they are listening and have their phone turned off during class. Then you will have to come up with a punishment for the student(s). However if you let them have a phone during free time and lunch time then you will probably have less of a hard time getting the students to follow the rules. Also their is the possibility that there could be an emergency in their personal life and they need to have their phone with them at all times. Students can not do so if cell phones are banned. From the way I see it if you want some cooperation you need to loosen their leash a little. Basically what I am trying to say is that it would probably be a more easier and a cooperative way of dealing with the cell phone issue.

P.S.- I hope you think about what I have said. Even from an adults point of view policy one is an excellent idea.

Your student,
