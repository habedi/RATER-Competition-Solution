Distance learning would be beneficial to students who can have hard a time staying attentive,who need to feel more comfortable, and who tend to be more susceptible to illness.

A classroom is full of disruptions, which can make it hard for students to keep attentive. By having online classes students can focus without a classmate or someone bothering them to talk, or wanting answers, or anything of that sorts. One could ask if a student at home could have distractions as well? The answer is yes but a student who works hard will understand that those distractions will be there later as well and if you are home almost all the time, then they won't be so much as distractions but annoyances that you can get rid of by moving to a designated room where you can be alone and free of any interference. And also parents would most likely get rid of any distractions so their child could do their best. Whilst at home students can also not worry about other peoples opinions on them.

School is a place of learning and its a place where you can express yourself freely and to feel comfortable doing so, its supposed to be a judgment free zone where students can make friends and be happy. Yet that is not reality, sadly school has become a place where people are put down for how they look and for how they talk, or for what is "wrong" with them. This causes many to have self esteem issues and they worry more about what they will wear rather than doing their homework. But the point being that distance learning would help so many become more comfortable in their own skin, which allows students to achieve the best they can in school. This would keep students happy and feeling good. It prevents bullying which helps prevent mental health issues within students keeping students safe from self harm or other bad things.

Students who could have mental health issues or recurring illness who miss a day or more of school would have the advantage if distance learning was in play because students could stay caught up with their schoolwork and maintain good grades. Being ill would't be such a problem for students to their classmates and teachers. Students could be home sicker than ever while still keeping everyone healthy and learning. However, one could argue that if you don't feel well, why would students get on the computer to go to school and learn or why would they get on at all if they were home? Well students understand even missing a day or two of school can put them behind for a couple days to even a week. So instead of risking to become a disappointment to their families and never having a good job or even a good life is worse. School is good for everyone even if sometimes kids don't like it, but they will all be grateful in the end.

Being happy and having a clear mind is important in school. It helps students stay awake and aware, it can help with staying healthy in mind and body, and even help someone feel more comfortable.
