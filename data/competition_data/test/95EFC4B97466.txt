Dear principal,

In my own opinion i think you should require all students to do some want of community service. Not only to help there self but to help earth and its environment. For example student can help pick up trash around and even recycle.

Its not even that hard and they only have to do like once or twice every week. We can even help stop the ozone layer for breaking more then what it is now. That would help alot. I mean helping stop the Ozone Layer from breaking more is hard work. It may take years and years of work, but if the world comes together to help stop this problem, its possible.

Even if the hole Ozone Layer is a big problem , the community service thing isn't .The community service thing is that simple and students that participate can even get a reward. Not a big reward but maybe something like extra credit for a class or small prizes. It a great idea and it can help earth as well as yourself.
