The author suggets that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers if presnts because if something happens to earth if we study venus we will know some stuff to do. Like all the needs to stay alive keep breathing and is it even possible. Because if a war happens with the usa and the blow up america we will need somwhere to go. So in order for us to know all of these things we will have to study abot other planets to survive at.

Venus also looks the sefest out of all the other planets. Its shaped like earth close to earth so its in the same atmosphere so it gets the same oxygen. the shape and size is pretty similar so there should be enough romm for people. its close to the sun so we dont know if its safe . it could be safe if the un rotates away from it so people can actually live their.

Since venus is so close to the sun we will have to send someone their to se if it liveable. if we ever decided to move to venus we will have to bring so much stuff and it would take a while. so i dont think everybody will make it before us is destroyed.
