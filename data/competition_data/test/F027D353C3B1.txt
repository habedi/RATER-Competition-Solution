Dear principal _____, i think that students should not have to do community service because me myself have done this and it takes a very long time and takes away from your relaxation time and homework time. so if we all do community service then all of us might not have time to do our homework and then we will get bad grades in school. if some students have sports and they are very good and going to a championship game then they might miss it or get kicked off of the team for bad grades. i think that students should be able to have time for homework. they should also be able to get grades that they deserve from being able to do homework. if we did community service we would be tired and go to bed straight away when we got home. if students have no free time they will get very stressed out and be mad and cranky too.
