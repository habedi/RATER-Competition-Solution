I will say yes I think is a good idea to use the new technology "Facial Action Coding System. I think this new technology is great to use so we can find how the sudents are feeling while they are in the school with teachers or friends so thats why I think this new technology is going to be great if we used to see what are the feelings of other people while they are smiling or they using a fake smile in front of other people.

Like in this passage they are trying to make Mona Lisa smile, but I see she was not feeling really happy. What I read in this passage about how they were trying to make Mona Lisa to smile it was a good way to use the new technology. In paragraph 9 they said, "By the way, did making a happy fave in this experiment also make you feel slightly happy." another quote they use it was "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion. moving your facial muscles not only expresses amotions, but also may even help produce them in a good way."

Lastly, for these reason the new technology can do a lot for all the people. Because we can see what are they feelings and maybe we can try to help them. Another good reason this quotes can help us is because some of them explain what the "Facial Action Coding" is a good way to figure out and it is eassy to used with out hurting people or making them to feel wrong if they are making a fake smile while they are doing the process.

In conclusion what the author said it was Mona Lisa is only 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and only 2 percent angry.
