summertime learning

Some students would not be happy about having a project to do over the summer and some students would be excited to do a project. However, if the students picked their own ideas and came up with what they want their project to be on, more students would agree to doing it. Teachers might pick a project that the students might not be interested in. Although, their are lot of positive things that comes with students picking their own projects to do. Such as, they will be more interested in the topic, they can come toghether and group up, also they will be sure to complete it.

Students would not be to happy about having to do a project over the summer but, if they came up with their own projects they wont think to much about it and they will be more interested in doing it. They will take their time on it and be ready to turn it in to the teacher when they go back to school. For example, when I get projects over breaks, I think about it, come up with ideas, try them out, and if i like it then I would continue on it. However, if the teacher designs it, it wont be so interesting, it will get boring, but you would still have to complete it though.

Second, they can get into groups and come up with ideas on what to do. That can be good because they will all come together as one, learn more about eachother, and focuse on completing the project. Sometimes the teachers design who they will be doing it with and its no fun like that. Its better if the students kind of did everything their way with a tad bit of knowledge from the teacher.

In conclusuon, this is why students should design their own projects to do instead of the teacher because there are alot of things that comes with them picking their won projects.
