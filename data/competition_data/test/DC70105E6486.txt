Is it beneficial to have a student designed project or a teacher designed project.

Student designed work would be beneficial because students would be able to choose work that appeals to them, they would have more motivation to finish the work and it gives students a more diverse selection of topics to choose from.

However not everyone would agree with this position. Some people may argue that a teacher designed project would be more beneficial due to the teacher being able to pick topics that would help students reflect and learn on material set in their class. For example, If you were to be taking a English course the English teacher would most likely assign work about topics that you would learn and have learn about before. Nevertheless there are other view points to consider.

To begin with students would be able to choose work that mostly appeals to them. For example if a student were to be from a unique country or have a unique ethnicity they could choose to have their project be about their culture or beliefs. Doing so would have students more comfortable with their projects due to the fact that they are familiar with who they are and where they come from.

In addition due to being familiar with the topic students have chosen, students would have more motivation as to why they need to finish this project. For instance a student that is familiar with the topic they had chosen for their project would be more motivated to finish than a student that has low intelligence on the topic given. A motivated student always produces but non motivated students are never a guarantee. Nevertheless there are other view points to consider.

Finally, Student designed projects will guarantee that you end up with a diversity of topics from with no repeating composure and subjects. Consider as an example a science fair, when you visit a science fair you are presented with multiple subjects and projects on robots, plants, liquids, etc. Imagine if you were a teacher having to grade the same projects from start to finish what a bore. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.

In conclusion, would it be better that students choose their own topic? Yes, it allows you to have different viewpoints on the project and diversify the topic and possibilities of the project. Let students choose their own topics and projects now.
