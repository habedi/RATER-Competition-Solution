Most schools have always been about students being in their classrooms physically. It has always been about being around some classmates you probably don't like, having to rush to a class on time so you're not late, or just listening to a teacher's lecture of a specific subject for an hour and some change. Why go through all that nonsense when you can just take your classes at the comfort of your own home? I think that students would benefit from attending classes from home because it would be more comfortable for them and it would decrease the risk of fights.

One way attending classes from home would benefit is that it would simply be more comfortable and relaxing for students. You wouldn't have to get dressed for school, you could just stay in bed with your pajamas while attending class, who wouldn't want that? It would be a lot more easier to get to your classes because nobody would be standing in your way. To make it even better, you don't even have to eat school lunch at a specific time, because you could eat whatever you want at any time, so you wouldn't have to worry about getting yelled at by your teacher in class over a bag of chips. For example, there has been an increase of online/video classes due to the coronavirus, so that students don't get sick. While they may move back to going back to school physically once the virus is over, it must be amazing for students who are just sitting in their bedroom while learning. Not only would this be more comfortable, it would also decrease the risk of getting sick. This shows how beneficial attending classes from home would be.

Another way attending classes from home could benefit is that it would decrease the risks of fights from happening. You may have heard of the saying "More People, More Problems", because that can apply to most schools. The more students you have, the more fights that could possibly happen. People like to start drama with each other, and can easily get upset over the smallest thing. To make it even worse, kids will try to record the fight and post it on social media, giving the school a bad representation of what it is. It's just a mess to deal with, but online classes can easily prevent that. Since everybody would be at home learning, it would be nearly impossible for students to get into a fight. They would be focused more on the online class they're doing, rather than what the other person is saying about them. I'm not saying that no fights will ever happen if we had classes from home, but they would be handling their business outside of school, so if they fight each other, they wouldn't face a consequence because they fought outside of the school campus. This shows how conflict between students could easily get solved with just taking your classes at home.

Some people think that attending class from home would be a bad idea because students could easily slack off by doing other things on the internet like watching Youtube. These people are wrong because the school would have most of these sites blocked on their school laptops, so it wouldn't even be possible for students to goof off on their laptops. Even if they do slack off, it's their fault for not taking their classes seriously. This shows that students could be capable of taking online classes, it just falls on them if they want to take it seriously or not.

It would be more comfortable and decrease the risk of fights if students benefited taking their classes from home. I feel that this could be beneficial for any school if they did it. If you're a principal reading this, maybe you should consider my two reasons as to why taking classes from home would be a great idea.
