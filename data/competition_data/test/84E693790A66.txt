Dear principal,

I think that students shouldn't be required to do community service.

I strongly think community service it a good thing and everyone should participate in it every once and a while.

But if they feel like they want to then they can do it.

But if they have sports or other activities they have to or enjoy doing they wont have as much time to do them.

If they have homework they also wont have as much time to do that either.

You could make it extra credit or make a statement that doing community service is good and can help many people if someone is up to do it.

Also you could start a school club that takes student to certain places were they can help people.

There are already a large amount of people that do community service.

I think it should be up to the students whether or not they want to participate in community service.

If there was a club I'm sure people would join it.

People should be able to choose what they want to do after school.

Not given a grade on whether or not they did a community service.

That is why I think community service should not be required at school.

But people should participate in doing something for the community every once in a while.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
