Schools should definitely require students to have some form of summer homework, so they are not completely brain-dead when they return the following year. The argument on whether or not it should be teacher or student designed is a tough one. Nevertheless, students' summer projects should be student-designed, because it makes it more fun, pushes students to be more creative, and is easier for students to complete.

Admittedly, some might claim that summer homework should be teacher-designed, because it provides more insightful, specific, instructions rather than each student doing their own thing. These claims are wrong, because if teachers want students to be more involved over summer, giving them the freedom to express themselves however they please is the best way to do so. Students would rather take the time to come up with their own projects than doing some old, outdated assignment like reading a specific book.

Firstly, summer projects should be student-designed because they are more fun on the students' behalf. Students would have the freedom to do whatever they want around a certain topic, giving them the means to complete it on their own time, their own way. For example, If the topic was about the book, " To Kill A Mockingbird " one could do a podcast, make a short film, write a review, make a pamphlet, or anything they want, regarding this topic. Students would be more dedicated to designing and completing their own work, start to finish.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because it pushes students to be more creative. Students are tasked with coming up with one of many types of ideas for the project, versus just doing whatever the teacher assigns. Students must be creative about what kind of project they want to design, how they want to do it, and how it will be different from his or her classmates. Students could also be assigned to compete against one another, which will push them to do their very best work. Students could even use their forte , which is social media, to complete these projects.

Furthermore, summer projects should be student-designed because it is easier for students to complete. When projects are teacher-designed, especially over summer, they can be hard to do. These projects sometimes have minimal instructions, and since it is over summer, there is no teacher guidance, just a bland rubric. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. Students also have better ideas for their own projects, which is why they prefer designing their own over a teacher-assigned one. Students will complete their own projects faster, have more fun with them, and even be able to incorporate their friends and classmates however they please.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because it is more fun on the students behalf, promotes creativity, and makes it easier for students to complete. Schools must be more open to these ideas, and also to the fact that students deserve a say in what they do or what they are assigned to. Schools must promote student involvement more, giving them the freedom and room to express themselves, while in a safe environment. Teachers also need to trust their students with being able to design and complete their own projects, which will help mature them and shape them into the adults the future needs.
