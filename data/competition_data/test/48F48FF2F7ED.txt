There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboy. The first reason is that you get to adventure and sight see. I know this because I got to explore an excavated castle and the Panama Canal on my way to china. I also road a gondola in the Venice, Italy streets of water. We also had to go to Greece with a load of 335 horeses plus the food and i got to see the Acropolis. I also got to play baseball and vollyball with other cowboys when they returned to give the animals back.

Another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to help countries that are in ruins from World War 2. I had to help recover food supplies, bring back animals, an help repair. Even on the ship you have to take care of animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped over seas. You had to feed them, give them water, and clean the stalls.

Sometimes you have to serve as a nightwatch, I did. I had to check the animals every night and make shure they were ok. I did make a mistake and slid down a slipery ladder and cracked my ribs but that was my fualt.

I would suggest anyone who loves adventureing with a friend and has always wanted to go on a adventure some where but couldn't. Or if you just like helping people, and animals recover from the war. This is the program for you, join the seagoing cowboys today!
