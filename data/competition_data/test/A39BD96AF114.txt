I am strongly against this policy that the principal is making because a lot of students like to be in sports and other different activities in school and i think its not fair for students that have a below C average to not be able to participate in something they really like to do like for example if the principal did changed the policy not a lot of students would be participating in sports and for some students spots are their main thing in school and maybe they are their main thing in life and it wouldn't be fair if they took that away from them and yes i know that we students need to have good grades to be in sports and other activities in school but i still think its not right for the principal to make that policy to the students. Like me i wouldn't like for the principal to do that policy because i would be kicked out of soccer for just one C that I have in my class and only for that one C that I have I would be kicked out of the soccer team and i really work hard in soccer to be where i want to be .If the principal rejects the policy a lot of students would be thank full specially me and some other students that have a C , But if she doesn't I guess a lot of students are going to work hard in class so they can join in again in their sports .
