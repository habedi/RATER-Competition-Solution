Dear Principal,

I find it very unfair that students need a grade B average to participate in School sports and activities! First of all, what if kids are really good at sports but don't have a grade B average, we need them for our school's reputation, what if only grade A and B average students who are really bad at sports participate in sports activities? This will surely embarrass our school reputation. and also some students under grade B average sometimes freak out about this new policy. We really need to cancel this new, unfair Policy! Also what about the activities!? What if students Are really good at playing the violin and are under grade B average? They will also freak out about it! They'll freak out about the fact that the cant do anything but look for a new hobby! I assure you, that on the day of the school concert, half of the people will leave. Why you ask? Because, maybe some people don't remember how to play the violin! now i think your asking how. Well if your policy is like that, people will have to focus their minds on grades and homework!!!!!! So imagine that new policy, embarrassing yourself and the school! So why not?

Go ahead, embarrass the school! Its not our problem, its yours! All the students disagree, all the faculty agree! Its now Students v. s. Faculty. ALL the students disagree on this policy.

Even some parents disagree. We students just want to play sports and instruments without having to worry about grades. Thank you for your time.
