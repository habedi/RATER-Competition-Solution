Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home online or by video conferencing. Students will benefit more from attending classes online because there would be less distractions, the students would feel less pressure from their teachers, and most students learn better working independently.

Going to public school can be really tough for some students because of how big some classes are and the lack of focus some students or even teachers have. In just about every classroom there is a small or sometimes big group of people who constantly talk and intentionally distract others making it difficult for the teacher to get through the material. Not everyone has the privilege to go to a private school with smaller classes and more focused students. That's where attending classes would come in, students would be in a more comfortable and safe environment if they had the ability to work from home. With the student being in control of their own learning environment they would be more successful and earn better grades on their assignments.

Attending classes online at home will put less stress on the student. When you're in school there are many different drills that can be very stressful because you dont know if it is just a drill or real. Drills also take up class time and some teachers are very strict with their deadline. For example, if a teacher gives you an assignment to do in the beginning of class they will most likely expect it to be completed by the end of class. Some students work slower than others so the ones who didnt get a chance to complete their assignment will get a lower score even if they got the majority of the work they completed right. Being in the safety and comfort of your own home will give you some peace of mind so you can focus on your work better, stop stressing, and get work done.

Many students are independent workers and like to learn the material on their own in a specific kind of way. Most students can agree that they feel like teachers over complicate and rush the material making it harder for the students to understand and learn the material. So then they have to go home and look up the same material online or even teach themselves. Students learning the material slower and more detailed can help improve their thinking and even their overall grades.

With that being said, some parents think that online classes aren't fair to everyone because not every household has internet. Even some students have shared their feelings and think that more students will cheat on the work if they take a class at home. Fortunately, the school board has already thought about these situations and decided that every student will be given a chrome book that comes with a hot spot that can only be used for school related work and any students caught cheating in any way will be removed from the program and will have to take the entire class over again in school.

In conclusion, students who will attend their classes online at home will have higher scores on their assignments, be less stressed and improve their thinking skills.
