imagine a world, twenety or so yeears from now, completely free of any nature. there is not a single tree, bush, flower or even a blade of grass to be found. only concrete roads and dirt everywhere, along with our cars driving on them. in the cars are us, fat lazy peoplle sitting in our cars, irritated and hollering out profanity at the mile long row of traffic as we try to get ot work. the cause of all this is toxic gases emited by our cars. this is our future. do we really want this to happen to us and ouur beautiful planet earth? i know i don't, and thats why all around the world, cities and even entire countires are doing something about it, they are working on cutting back peoples' vehicle usage, or even eliminnating it. without the cars, there would be a drastic decrease in polution, peoples' physical health would improve, and no more stress.

we all use cars, it has become a daily thing for all of us. we have become so acustomed to driving that we don't even think about it. we never thought about just how much damage our cars were doing on our home, planet earth. cars are the leading source of polution, everyday the polution is ripping awway at our ozone layer, slowly dooming us all and we are definnatly feeling the heat from it. places such as Vauban, Germany, have given up cars completely. in this experimental district, street parking, driveways and home garages are forbiden and, except for the main thoroughfare, the streets are commpletely car free. thanks to this, greenhouse gases in this area have gone down. residents of this town don't even seem to mind the car free life, they even enjoy it. having clean air makes this district a beautiful placce to live in.

not havinf motor vehicles also can immprove physical health. humans, especially Americans, have become incredably lazy, and as a result, incredably fat. no one has time in their busy schedual to excersize. everyone is too busy with work, school, kids, chores, or anythinng else. but, if we all got rid of cars and people either walked to and from their destinations, we would all be losing weight, be more aactive and be so muuch helthier. also, the helthier you are, the longer you live, so getting rid of cars will increase your life span!

having a car can also mean having a lot of stress. theres traffic backing you up making you an hour late for work, high gas prices sucking all the money out nof your wallets, expensive repair prices, and you are always putting your life at risk if you get into an accident. all this to think about while your just trying to get from point A to point B can be very stress full. but if everyone walked or biked to and from wherever, there would be much less traffic, no need for gas, the only repairs you would have to get is pumping more air in your tires, the onnly accident you might have is runninng your bike into another's bike and as long as you wear the right protectionn gear, you are very safe.

all of these factors add up to a safer, cleaner, helthier environment. if we all start now to eliminate cars, theworld would bbe a much bbetter pllace.
