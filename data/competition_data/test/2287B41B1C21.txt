The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit." Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He has classified six basic emotions - happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raise your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris(around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an efective human instructor." The same technology can make computer -animatedfaces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. I belive it can read your emotional expressions better than a average human can because it can scan your face and see what your emotion is even if you pretend to be happy and your not. I think its a great creation soon everyone will use it and believe to.
