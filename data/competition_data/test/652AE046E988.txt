The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because if the computer read you are bored it can change to somthing more fun. If the computer read you are sad it and change to somthing happy. Also is it read you are happy it can stay like that.

If you are reading or doing somthing bording your full focus wouldn't be on it so if the computer read that it can change it to somthing more fun to read or do. It can make it more happy or scary (if you like that). It will make those days when you know you have to read something bording fun.

Next, there are people who don't read as fast or understand like other so if you get a little confused the FACS can change it to your level or it can have someone help you by reading it or giving you tools to understand more.

Last, if you are enjoying the text you are reading or work you are doing the FACS can let the computer know to stay on it and it can give you more like that for your enjoyment.

In conclutiond the FACS is valuable in classroom because it can make boreding things more fun. It can make the reading your level if you are confused. Also if the like what you are reading and can give you more like it.
