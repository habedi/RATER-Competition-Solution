I think that having driverless cars would be fun yeah, but i dont know if i would trust them at all times. Like what if you wanted to go to sleep? Would you trust a car with your family, or friends in it? I dont know if i would completly trust a car to get me where i want to be without it wrecking. I mean yeah i guess you can trust the smart people who made it, but i don't know if you could fully trust the car itself. Anything could go wrong.

My opinon is my opinon, other people may think differntly. But oh well. Most people would probaly buy this exspensive car just to look cool, but i mean would you rahter risk your safety? I dont know if i would. I mean look at all the people who do drugs, and other things just to look cool. They risk their lives, waist their money, and time just to impress somebody else. That's stupid! People can take over when they want to, so i think that that's kind of good to be able to have that protection. If somethings going wrong, then the car would make noises basically saying " hey something wrong here".

I think its honestly up to the people, and how they feel about getting in a car that drives on its own. Yes, i kind of do think it would be fun to be able to have a car drive me, but on the other hand, it would be kind of scary too. There are some reasons why i'd pick to own one. I would own one, because they would be nice to own. It'd be interesting too! I think i could get use to having a car driving me around. Another reason why i think people would perchase this car, is to have it drive them home, or around place to place when they can't drive because they are drunk. I think that's smart really, because their not risking other people lives, when their out getting drunk, and try to drive themselves home. So yeah im 50/50 about driverless cars. I kind of have my opinon on owning one, and not owning them. So im not really against it, and im not fully sure about ever owning one. If the world decides to drive driveless cars, then i'd probally be more willing to own one myslef. I think i'd rather see how driverless cars go with other people before i purchase one. That would be smart to watch before you waist your money on smomething that might break, or you could possibly get hurt by or die in. I'd rahher be able to trust the car a little more, and see how things go, before i accually buy one for myself.
