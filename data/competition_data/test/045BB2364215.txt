This technology will not be needed in classrooms. They wont be needed because a teacher wont change the way they teach just because 1 students isnt happy wih they way they teach. Another reason why they shouldnt have this new technology is just because they probably dont have the money for it. Final reason why they shouldnt get this is because it wont benifit any student. its only going to help with one thing and thats to help the teacher figure out who is bored and who isnt. Schools dont need this.

First reason as to why school should not get this new emotional expression technology is because teachers really wont care what one student thinks. The thing will say that you're bored and that their lesson sucks but teachers really wont care what you think because the rest of the class doesnt think that. They might give you extra help but they wont change the way they are teaching just because 1 student is bored.

Another reason why schools should not get this is because their budget. This will probably be very expensive and schools probably cant afford one for each class. The school should also remember that it will only do one thing and thats read emotion. It wont make any student smarter, it''ll just read their emotional expression and its not very useful. Schools shouldnt spend a ton of money on a machine that will only help with 1 thing.

Finaly reason as to why schools shouldnt get this is because this emotional expression machine isnt going to benifit any student. Its only going to read an emotion and nothing else. It wont make anyone any smarter than they already are and its just a waste of time,money, and space.

Schools should not get this new technology because it wont help anyone but the guy who created it. It'll be fun to mess around with but it wont be useful. There shouldnt even be an argument about this because its actually dumb to think that schools want to but an expensive machine that will not help anyone in any way.
