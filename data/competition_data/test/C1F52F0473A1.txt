The principal has decided that seven hours of school isn't enough. Now he is making everyone do at least one extracurricular activity every week. The students aren't given a choice, they are being forced to use their own time, not during the school day, to participate in an activity they may not want to do. Students should be able to choose what they want to spend their free time doing. It can be damaging to students if they are not able to choose how they want to spend their afternoons after a long, hard school day. This plan can cause many negative effects on students like getting less sleep, worse grades, and many other negative consequences.

With the principles approach, students will have less time to complete their assignments. Going to an activity will take time that can be used for things like completing homework away from the students. They will have less time to complete their homework, which means they most likely will stay up later than normal and get less sleep. This can cause the student to focus less and do worse in school, and can also affect their mental health A more reasonable approach would be to promote participating in extracurricular activities. That way, more students will join, but it will be their choice. It is not fair that this valuable time is being taken away from them.

The principle's approach may sound positive at first, but looking into it shows it can be very unhealthy for students. I feel that us students are being violated, and that we should be given the choice to join activities or not. The principle's plan will most likely backfire and cause students to do worse in school. People will eventually realize that his decisionÂ is absurd.
