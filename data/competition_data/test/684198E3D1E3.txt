Phones V.S. Driving

Nowadays people are on their phones all the time on a daily basis, whether or not these should be allowed while driving is an easy answer. They shouldn't be allowed at all while driving for reasons I will state.

Phones are distracting. Phones aren't like other distractions they almost always require your full attention (unless it's calling). If your browsing social media while driving you're going to be reading what's on your phone rather than drive or you will be playing a game on your phone rather than watching the road you're watching the game. when your texting unless you know the keyboard like the back of your hand then you're going to make typos and grammar mistakes which will lead you to be glued to your screen to make a good text.

Phone use in general is just a bad idea. You aren't giving the road your full 100%

attention while using a phone and if you slip up and look at your phone for a second you can cause an accident. Some things while driving need split second reactions like, someone in front of you stopping without warning abruptly or a car swerving into your lane or a person walking onto the road, if you're on your phone while driving and any of these things happen you're sure to cause an accident or even worse kill someone.

To play devil's advocate the one caveat to this essay is calling. With Aux cords in virtually in every car and Bluetooth becoming more mainstream in more recent cars, you don't need to be holding a phone to call someone. You can do it all from your steering wheel with newer cars if you get a call while driving your car will accept the call and you can talk while not even touching the phone. While aux cords aren't as good as Bluetooth there still amazing at keeping you hand free, you can just pick up your phone while its hooked up to the car and pick it up and put your phone down while talking on the phone though the car.

In conclusion phones should not be used at all for things like that you need to be watching the road for anything that gets literally and figuratively thrown your way, phones are just straight up distracting and you should not be distracted while driving for reasons stated earlier and because it's just irresponsible the only exception to this is using an aux cord or

Bluetooth while calling someone.
