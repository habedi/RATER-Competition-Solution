Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to have Cell Phones at school, but when there in class, they have to be turned off and put away. This way Students may have a greater time at school, but still learn everything you want them to. Also, you don't have to worry about Cell Phones going off in class. I think this is a great idea and would be a great thing for you and your school.

Students should enjoy the freedom of allowing Cell Phones at school. It's a good idea to let them have there phones out during there free times, like lunch and breaks between daily classes.

I agree, students need to have there Phones turned off during class time. They will be able to learn in a good environment, and can learn everything you expect of them.

You won't have to worry about your students Cell Phones going off in the middle of class. Students shouldn't have there Phones out ,or even on during class time. This is a good rule and students should respect it. This rule works well in other schools, and it should work great in your school.

That is why I think you should allow cell phones, but only on there breaks, not during class.
