Dear Principal,

I think that we should be able to play sports with a C average or higher because many of the students have a C average. If that wasn't able to happen then the school wouldn't have a team. There are many good players that don't get a chance to play because they have a C average and the principal expects a B average from them. There are also many students that would like to join other activities but they are not able because they are not passing with a B average. I think that the students should get a chance to be able to play sports or join other activities with a C average. Then i also think that students shouldn't be able to play or join in activities if they are not passing because it would be better if they would go get help from the teachers. If they would go get help they would get better grades and be able to join any sport or activity they would like to, but this choice is up to the principal.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
