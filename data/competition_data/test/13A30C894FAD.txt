Dear TEACHER_NAME

Not all students enjoy doing community service or helping out other people. Yes it would be nice if some of them did take the time out to help. If you asked me for my option on this I would say no. For example some students might have to go home and watch their little brother/sister, and just don't have the time. While other kids might have a sport they play in and they have practice.

If you made everybody perform community service it would be crazy. Like I said before not only do students have things to do, but they might already be involved in an activity. As a student

I don't have time to do some things due to homework. Now just think would you rather for us to complete a certain amount of community service or get an education? Now once which one would you rather us do? Yes of course get an education! I know If I was you I would want my students to complete all their work, and then worry about staying after for school.

Now if the student had a little extra time maybe he/she might want to help the kids at the elementary school or even go volunteer at the animal shelter. Say a student jus got a call from their mother and it was a family emergency what do you expect them to do then? Yea giving back by helping another by student is a good idea, but not all kids have the time. Once again TEACHER_NAME my opinion on all students have to do community service is no.

A proud student of SCHOOL_NAME
