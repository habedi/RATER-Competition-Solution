That is not fair I got a c average and I could play sports .If u change it many students will not be aloud to play. Even when the are really good. They mite be the next big thing and they cant play because the have a C average. IF u do that most likely your school will not be so good in sports.

And if your school not good at sports less kid and parent would wont to go to that school but .If your school good at sport and one of the smarts school .Many parents would what there kids to go there .That mean money the school get . For many other stuff. Like art or airspace.

You can also get newer books and better lunches. Some kids mite not eat meat but because the school will only let student with a B grade point average. That not very good play for your school. Instead of a person wench has a C point grade average. That can play that sport very will.
