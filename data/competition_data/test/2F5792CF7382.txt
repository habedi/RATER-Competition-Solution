scientist wanna learn more about the planet venus to see how it is and if it really is the closest planet to earth there is in this solar system.

The planet Venus is a difficult planet to search because earth has sent multiple missions for it unmanned because no spacecraft survied the landing more than a few hours. A spaceship has not touched down into Venus in more than three decades. The reason why its hard is because venus atmosphere is very thick, its 97% carbon dioxide. Also the clouds of venus have sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere. The average temperature in venus is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit. the pressure of the atmosphere is 90 times greater than what we have in our own planet, that type of pressure could crush anything.

the reason they wanna know more about venus is because astronomers wanna learn more about the planet. the reason they are so curious is because its the closest earth like planet in our solar system. They say that long ago venus had an ocean and could have had various forms of life in it. the way astronomers wanna learn more about it is by using a blimp like vehicle that hovers around 30 miles floating above the venus landscape. But most forms of like cannot penetrate venus thick atmosphere.
