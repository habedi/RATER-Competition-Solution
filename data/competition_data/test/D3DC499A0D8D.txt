Dear, State Senator

I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. What is the point of voting if the Electoral College decides who wins? Using popular vote means the citizens would actually decide on who would win. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. Who picks the electors in the first place? The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state.

Sincerely,

The Voters
