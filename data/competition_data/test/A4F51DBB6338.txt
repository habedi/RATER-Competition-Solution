Summer is a time where many students forget about school and let their academic stress go for a sweet couple of months. During this time, however, students tend to let go of their knowledge and desire to learn as well. Summer assignments/projects given from school are widely regarded as a way to keep students engaged in their learning during the vacation months. There is the question, however, of how to go about designing these assignments; should the teacher design the project, or should the student design their own? I believe summer projects should be student-designed, because it provides an opportunity for students to explore what interests them, and ensures that they can take personal initiative in their own learning.

Students who are tasked with designing their own projects get to explore their creativity in relation to their academics. In my years as a student, I have found that, when given the freedom to design my own assignments or projects, I feel much more encouraged to tap into my creative side. An example of this is when I was assigned a "personal project" by my English teacher in eighth grade. For this project, I was given the liberty of choosing my own subject, how I researched, and what my medium for presentation would be (written paper, powerpoint, video, etc.). Completing this assignment on my own terms opened my eyes to how pleasant and fulfilling learning can be when it is something I am actually interested in doing. I believe that this same concept of student-designed learning should be integrated into summer projects. Doing this will help students associate school and learning with things that are interesting and engaging, instead of stressful and boring.

In addition to keeping students engaged, student-designed projects will teach pupils to take control of their academic endeavors, and facilitate their transition into a more independent learning style. In my current experience of researching universities, I am aware of the drastic change in style between high school and college. For example, high school is very structured and organized, with several classes a day, every day, for a specific 7 hour period. College, on the other hand, leaves a student with much more freedom and time on their hands, similar to summer break in that aspect, especially when attendance is not manditory for some classes. It is vital for one to know how to manage their own learning and take that initiative to complete their work in a timely manner. If a student has no desire/motivation to learn, as well as no responsibility over their own learning, they will struggle greatly in a college environment. However, if schooling implements a more student-designed approach, students will have the opportunity to practice independence, responsibility, and perhaps most importantly, learn their own way and what works best for them as an individual.

Some people may disagree with my stance, claiming that the majority of students are incompetent in designing an adequate project for themselves, that they need the control of a teacher-designed project to guide them over the summer and keep them on track. On the contrary, I feel the opposite is true. If a student is not "responsible enough" to lead ther own learning yet, then it is school's duty to teach them that valuable life skill, instead of confining them with more pressure and constrictions that will only grow their disdain for school in general. Without the weight of a teacher bearing down on them, students are able to grow a passion for learning that they perhaps had never known before. Once school stops being seen as a chore or a nag is when students can unlock their full potential as life-long learners. Developing the skills associated with student designed projects will help them in any future endeavors, whether it be academic or carreer related.

In conclusion, summer projects most definitely should be student-designed, due to the opportunity for exploration, growth, and responsibility it can provide. It is common knowledge that everybody learns in a different way. It is very easy for children and teens to develop a negative attitude towards school, especially when they are constantly assigned projects that do not utilize their individual learning style. However, students need to understand that education leads to freedom in life; the freedom to pursue a carreer, to make informed opinions, and to never stop learning new things. Academic education should be treated as such. Students can and will reform their ideas of learning if simply given more freedom to take charge of their education, in whatever little ways possible.Â
