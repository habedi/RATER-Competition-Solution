The Seagoing Cowboys program is great because you get to travel to unique places. As part of this program, I got to go to China, Greease, Europe, Italy and Crete. We also found out how to have fun abored the ship by having Vollyball tornamints, played Basketball, Boxing, reading, and other stuff also. The Seagoing Cowboys helps out with the rubish from World War II.

The program can be dangerous, but you help people and you get to help thoese in need and get to go to new places. People who have been with the Seagoing Cowboys said it was a great opportunity.

Luke Bomberger was part of the program. It opended up a world to him. "I'm greatful for this oppertunity," He says "It made me more awere of people of other countiries and their needs." That awereness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of internasinal students and exchange visiters for years. Thoese are some great thing that happened on the Seagoing Cowboys, its a great oppertunity and I hope you take that oppertunity.
