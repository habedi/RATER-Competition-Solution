Dear principle,

I think that community service will help not only people around, but the people that are doing it as well. This is a great idea and this can help children in the future. This would look great to all colleges and states. But there is some flaws. There would be an enormous amount of chaos breaking through. There is a cause and effect to everything, you will need to keep that in mind.

This idea is a lot like communism; it looks great on paper, but when you put it in action, a lot of problems occur. You have to think about the after effects that could possibly happen. For example, if you were to take away from students free time, parents would argue that they would need the child at home for something. Also, if a student were to have an event after school and time was to be taken away from that event for community service, there would lots of complaints. Do you see what i am talking about? I am trying to say that this is just not needed. Again I say, that this would look great on paper, but just will create problems once in action.

If you really wanted to help other people. Then instead of after school detention or suspension, you could use community service as a punishment. If a child was suspended you could put them in community service for a while. This would always work, trust me! I appreciate your time that you have given me! You should really take this into consideration!

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
