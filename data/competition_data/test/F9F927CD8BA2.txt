Imagine the many things you could do if you participated in a extracurricular activity. There is a wide variety of activities to choose from. For example; Orchestra, choir, FCCLA, FCS, and FFA. If students participated in extracurricular activities, it would help them to open their eyes to new ideas and careers. So yes, I believe that the principal should have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

First, you could take FCCLA of FCS. FCS stands for "Family Consumer Science". This course will teach you how to cook, clean, sew, and live a healthy lifestyle, you would be able to travel to places like Tennessee, Florida, Texas, and more! You can compete for awards with public speaking and meet new people. The cost for these trips may be a little expensive, but it's defiantly worth you money and time! By participating in this class, colleges may notice your skill and talents and hand a scholarship over to you.

The second activity I would recommend is FFA. FFA stands for "Future Farmers of America". In this course, you will learn how to take care of livestock and you will travel to nearby towns and states to compete. FFA is similar to FCCLA and FCS, but the difference is FFA covers farming, taking care of livestock, and it will teach you how to be a a farmer, while FCCLA or FCS will cover cooking, cleaning, sewing, and how to raise a family.

Third, we have orchestra. Orchestra will teach you how to play either the violin, viola, cello, and/or string bass. The violin is high pitched and small, while the string bass is the complete opposite. The string bass is very large and low pitched. The cello and viola on the other hand, are a medium pitch. Violas are around the same size as the violin, and the cello is smaller than the string bass, but larger that the violin or viola. Your instrument comes with a stick with horse hair attached to it. This is called a bow. To use a bow, you have to learn the bow grip and run the bow along the strings.

Finally, we have choir. Choir has four sections split into eight. Sopranos, altos, tenors, and bass. These four groups are split into two groups each. Sopranos one and two, altos one and two, tenors one and two, and bass one and two. Sopranos are the high pitched singers, while tenor and bass are lower. Tenor is a bit higher pitched that bass, but not that much. Altos are somewhere in the middle. Some singers have a wide range and can sing from bass all the way up to soprano.

By participating in any of these activities, you could possible get a scholarship. You could make a career out of the activities. You could be a famous cellist, violist, violinist, or string bass player. You could be a famous singer and go on tour with friends and family. You could pursue a career in farming and veterinary work, or you could be a famous cook like Gordon Ramsey. Extracurricular activities could open your eyes to new careers. I highly suggest entering an extracurricular course, because you could go very far. So yes, I do believe that the principal should make it a requirement to perform in an extracurricular activity.
