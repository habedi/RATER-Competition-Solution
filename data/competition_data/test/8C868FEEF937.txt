Driverless cars can be a dangerous development and should not be made.

Sergy envisions a future with public-transportation replacing personal vehicles,this can spark conflicts or dissatisfaction because we hold our personal possesions close and would not rely on public-transportation,

Electronic cars can be vulnerable to hacking even in googles hands,without manual piloting a driverless car be a serious hazard on roads. if the LIDAR malfunctions the car is blinded and will most asurudely crash into its surroundings unless the person takes manual control.

It mentions in paragraph 6 that they intend to make cars more and more independant,and that sensors will be the cars main feature to see. this again can be hazardous if those sensors are disrupted or hacked. in pargraph 7 it mentions that the car can steer, accelerate, and brake on its own,a car doing that at the wrong moment can cause a major crash or serious injury to the driver,and flashing lights on the windshields can be distracting if the car is in manual use.

Lawmakers know safety is best achieved with an alert driver,so traffic laws have made smart cars illegal even to test computer-driven cars in California, Nevada, and the District of Columbia.

Driverless cars should not be used because they are vulnerable to hacking, glitching, and disruption and can be a road hazzard in any situation, so you should not support automated cars and further develop driver dependant cars.
