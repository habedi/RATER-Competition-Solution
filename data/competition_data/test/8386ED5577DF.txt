Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to make new friends at school without having to do any boring schoolwork? Believe it or not; you can! By deciding to stay after school, you've signed up for tons of fun! You can do homework with peers, participate in fun activities, and maybe even meet your new best friend!

There's a vast variety of awesome activities to take part in, and you can choose to do whichever ones you want. Do you want to create art? Join the art club! Do you want to compete in sports? There are plenty to choose from! There are so many activities that you're bound to find yourself having fun with something! If you don't understand something in one of your regular classes, you can go to your teacher for help! That's right, teachers stay after school too! There's something for everyone.

Since you choose what activities you want to participate in, it is likely that you'll meet others with similar interests to your own. There are many different types of people you could meet after school. It's nearly impossible not to get along with at least one person. I'm not saying you'll like everyone you meet, but it's only logical that you'll find someone nice.

Clearly, having a rule requiring extra-curricular activities wouldn't be so bad. It's fun and exciting. So much so that most people would probably do it anyways. Even without the rule that requires it. I don't believe that there's anything wrong with this awesome new rule.   Â
