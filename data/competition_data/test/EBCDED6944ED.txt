People have been battling to find the best learning method, which can serve humankind well and move us closer to the future. One of the ideas out there is distance learning, an option for students to attend classes from home and to learn by watching online videos. But does this method work? No. Distance learning is one step backward from the future because it is not the most effective way of learning, it decreases the work rate of students, and it causes mental health issues for both students and educators.

First of all, distance learning is not the most effective way of learning. So what is the most effective way? Face-to-face learning, or also known as observational learning. Scientists and psychologists proved that it is the most effective way of learning. How come? Let's visit the past. Thousands and millions of years ago when human first developed, our first learning way is to learn face-to-face. We drew symbols in caves, made fires, hunted animals, and grew crops, all thanks to observational learning. But observational learning has proved its magic on other occasions as well. For example, the famous experiment called Bobo Doll, conducted by Albert Bandura, had shown us that children are more likely to copy the behaviors of adults when they are presence. It is the first learning way children are exposed to at a very young age. Some will argue that they can learn by observing the actions online, so the traditional way of learning is unnecessary. It doesn't work that way. Psychologists proved that students are more likely to remember information if they are in the appropriate environment, which is the classroom. When students can remember information, it means they can perform the given tasks well.

Second of all, distance learning decreases the work rate of students. Not every students are alike. Some work hard no matter what, some prefer not to. By offering the option of distance learning to students, they will take advantages of the technology and most students will choose the "online" way to make their life easier; consequently, distance learning will results in laziness, lacks of motivation to strive for the best, and low employment rate in the future. On the other hand, students who are used to observational learning will do much better in life compared to those who prefer online learning. Scientists said people who prefer observational learning will be more open-minded, more forgetful, and higher chances of succeeding in life.

Last of all, distance learning causes mental health issues for both students and educators. If distance learning is widely used, it will results in the lack of communication between peers and educators, which means students and teachers don't get the best experience and relationships between them will be weak. The main point of education is to make students understand lessons and to collaborate with peers. If there is no collaboration, there is no meaningful relationships. In this modern world, collaboration beats the technology. We got here because of collaboration, so why would we do such things to turn students away from collaborating with others? People said that they want to change the educational system. They said by offering distance learning, it is one big step for humankind toward the future and it benefits students. But is the "big step" they said worth it? No. We, as humans, do not need distance learning. Observational learning has served us well and make miracles come to life. For example, Neil Armstrong took the big step for humankind, thanks to observational learning and the appropriate environment that NASA chose to follow. Steve Jobs did the same, thanks to observational learning. Former President Barack Obama made history as becoming the first African-American president of the United States, thanks to the observational learning. He won voters by talking directly to them. That is not the magic you can replicate through a computer screen.

Students deserves the best education because they are the future of humankind. Although they are only 20% of the world's populations, but they are 100% of our future. You want to make history, history is already there to guide you. Don't make the unnecessary change, let the past embraces us, teaches us lessons, and sticks to the traditional way of learning. I don't have faith in our educational system, but I have faith in humans. Distance learning are one step backward from the future.Â
