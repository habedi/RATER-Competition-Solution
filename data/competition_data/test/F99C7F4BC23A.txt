Dear Principle,

I am writing this letter to you because you have decided to change the school policy on sports. I agree with you 100%. If students care so much about sports they should have to keep their grades up. If a student is not passing or doesn't have a B average they should not be aloud to play sports. If the student is so involved in whatever sport he or she is wanting to play or is playing, they will do almost anything to make the team or stay on the team. If a student is so involved in the sports then they will most likely not focus as much on there school work, which will end up making their grades drop or possibly make them fail there classes. You can get into some colleges by your athletic ability but most colleges will also look at your grades. If someone isn't as good of an athletic but have better grades they will most likley chose the person with the better grades. The reason I think they would chose the person with better grades is because we don't need to become a football or basketball player to live ,and there are a lot of people needing medicine or a good place to live and yes you can help these people but if you are a football player or some kind of player you will put that before anything because you don't want to look bad in front of your team or on NFL or NBC. I would love for this policy to be changed because students should strive and work hard for a good education. A lot of countries ,and even some cities, don't have the privilege to get to come to school and learn how to read or write. We should not take advantage of our opportunity to have a good school and good teachers. Some kids care more about sports than their grades but in the future, how many kids out of that class will end up a pro. star?

Love, one of your students
