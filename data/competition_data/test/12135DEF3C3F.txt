Dear Principal:

Dear principal i herd that you were thinking about changing the school's cell phone policy. I also herd that you either want to have students leave them at home or you will let them have them at school as long there in pockets and are off, students can use them at lunch and other free time. I think that you should you should let kids bring them to school and them be able to use them at lunch and other free times.

I think this because i would personally want to be able to use my phone in class. I'm sure that other students would love to use there phones at lunch and on other free times.

On the other hand students might abuse the ability to use there phone. The phones might also get stolen or broken. Another reason students should be able to have there phones on campus is so they can get a-hold of there mom's and dad's. But students also might abuse this by telling there mom's and dad's to come and pick them up because there sick or something.

I hope that you will let students bring there cell phones to school. I also hope that students don't abuse this privilege. Another thing that might happen is students will text in class and not pay attention. this would be a problem for the teachers and also for the students.

Your Fellow student
