Some cars are to loud and causes alot of polution in the world today. The most problem is the  polution thats coming out of the cars. Limiting the usage of your car can become a big help in the community today, not only that it can help our atmosphere and the air that breathe from sun up to sun down. For years people have been using the cars that run on fuel that polutes our air. some countries do not like speacialy Paris. Lets find out more why Paris dont like fuel using cars.

Paris enforced laws that ban car usage to clear the air of the global city. Motorists that has driving licences were ordered to leave their vehicles home. If they did not follow that law they would have to pay a $31(22-euro) fine. Some people had their car impounded due to their reaction for paying the fine. THAts when they came up with an idea by making cars that run on electicty or solar to cut down fuel usage. For this reason, car traffic was down atleast 60% in the capital of France. Thats one reason why you should limit your car uasage.

Bogota, Colombia made up an event, they called it car-free day. Thats when  everybody leave their cars home. Thats the day when you would had hiked,biked, skated or even took the bus to work or where ever you were going. The reason for them making that up was to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog. If you didnt follow this event you would have to face a $25 fine. Even though on somedays it would rain, it hasnt stop people from participating. This was a way to cut down stress on people and to reduce ait polution. THis event has spreaded through cities. This is an another advantage for limiting car usage.

Basically these are somethings that you can do to help the communtiy. Some people may not like the idea, but it doesnt help to atleast try.
