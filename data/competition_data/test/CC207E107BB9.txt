Dear principal,

I don't think making it necessary to do community service is a good idea. Community service is a good thing to do, but not everyone has the time to do it. Some people are in extra curricular activities that involve staying after school. Some might be doing things after school that take time away. Other kids get too much homework that it takes them all night to finish it all. Parents or guardians might not be able to drive their child to the place needed. Students might fall short of grade expectations because they don't have enough time to do their homework or they aren't rested enough to pay attention. Community service should be a choice, not something that you have to do in order to pass. Yes, community service is important, but should not be required. Community service should be something you want to do and on your own will, not be forced to do against your own will. There's barely enough time for me to do my homework, read, go to dance and still be well rested for tomorrow. I have no free time. Doing community service would mean staying up late and sleeping only a few hours each night which leads to bad grades because I can't focus which means remediation and possibly failing the eighth grade.
