Phones and driving

I believe that car drivers should be able to use their phone while driving but not over a certain speed limit so that if they get distracted they are not going that fast therefor there is a less chance of being seriously hurt. This new law could help a lot of people and even save lives.

Imagine that you're driving down the road at 30 miles an hour your mom is calling you but according to the new law you can't even touch your phone while in the car. I find this very absurd given that the chance of one dying at this speed is very low. Now imagine going 70 miles an hour and your mom calls you of course you should not pick it up because the chance of dying at this speed is way higher.

I believe that it should be left up to the people if they want to kill themselves by being distracted. Then let them kill themselves. At one given time there are 660,000 people on their phones while driving and 1 out of 4 accidents are caused by using a phone when driving. The best route is to inform people of the dangers instead of just incriminating it.

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to even touch a phone while driving the only way to be able to talk is a hands-free device. This a very smart choice on the safety side of issues but on the personal side it can mess a lot of people up because they need to be able to access their phone. That's why they should not incriminate it but there should be open statistics and info about crashes and fatalities due to these crashes.

In conclusion I believe people should just make better choices because you never know it could just save your life. The best choice right now though is to invest in a hands-free device, so you won't be distracted, and police can't give you a ticket for talking on the phone. in other words don't touch your phone unless its super important because nothing is more important than your life.
