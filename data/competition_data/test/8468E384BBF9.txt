The author talks about the dangers of exploring Venus, he also talks about much safer ways to explore the planet.

Paragraph 2 says," These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus" This means that being able to determine where the spaceship is headed would be quite difficult considering the act that it may take a while to get there and the chances of Venus moving are pretty high.

Lastly the paragraph also states," Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survuved the landing for more than a few hours." The author says that Venus is the closest planet to being the most Earth-like because of its familir features, for example, Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters.

In Paragraph 3, it says not only are there "clouds of highly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus's atmosphere" but there's a thick atmosphere of about 97 % carbon dioxide "blankets" Venus. Paragraph 3 also states,"On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." At last, the passage states," also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."

All of this information is important to have in mind if NASA were to suggest we leave planet Earth to go to Venus for a planetary visit just so we know what to expect and be aware of the precautions we should take.
