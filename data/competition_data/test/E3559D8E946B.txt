Dear Principle,

I am writing you this letter to inform you on my opinion and advice on community service. I know it seems bizarre for someone on your power to listen to a student. I just want to inform you on what community service helps with and what is it.

Community service allows many people, not only students, to help their community by picking up litter at parks and other public places. Also by, helping the elderly, tutoring children at their elementary schools and much more in that sort. Sometimes students and some adults might find it time consuming and just as a waste of time, but i think it is best for us and others in the community.

Some of my friends help around the community by picking up litter and tutoring children as I told you above. They say they have fun with it because they do it as a group. I was thinking that maybe you should consider having groups of students participate in community service as credits to pass school, which would make it mandatory. From my experiences in doing community service, I can honestly tell you that once you have accomplished it, it makes you feel great about yourself knowing that you have helped others around you and in your community.

I hope you take this letter into consideration and that you think about making it a "have to" activity. I am pretty sure students will enjoy doing community service if they do it with a group of friends they like being with. Thank you and please get back to me.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
