I agree with that all students must endure in a extracurricular activity because the activity is keeping you active, spend more time out or your home, and limit the amount of time doing unessecary things such as video games.

Extracurricular activities will keep a student active and happy while participating in the activity a student choose. For example if you do an afterschool sport that you enjoy, it is keeping your academics high which will better you for your future. Sports can get you where you want to be in life, you know if you are good at it and you put your mind at its best to what you are doing. For example if a student wants to be a lawyer then that students can do the extracurricular activity, student council.

Another reason why students must endure in a extracurricular activity because it is limiting the amount of time a student spends on their phone and video games. When you participate in extracurricular activities it is expanding your social life, because you are doing an activity or activities with other people which is a great way to make new friends. Making new friends during an after school activity carries on to the next day or so in actual school, so thats a good reason why students must participate in a extracurricular activity to expand the students social life.

Once you are in a extracurricular activity you are spending less time in your home doing nothing which is a good thing in this scenario. And video games fry your brain unlike an afterschool activiy. Any extracurricular activity is better than you being on your and video games because afterschool activities is basically keeping your brain active and healthy. Students should recommend exctracurriclar activities due to several reasons.

In conclusion to, extracurricular activities should be highly recommended by students because of several reasons such as keeping your academic skills up to part, staying active, and limit the amount of time a student spends on their cellular device and video games.
