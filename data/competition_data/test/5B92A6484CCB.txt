Dear Principal,

I think that you are right. Sports should be a privilege to the students that work hard every day and have a B average. I think that sports should not be apart of schools with young students because most students focus to much on sports and really the only thing that you need to focus on is your education.

Most schools require a D and if you get an F you have to and talk to that teacher and try to get your grade up to a D at lease. Plus I think that your teachers have to get a weekly report to your coach about your behaiovr and concerns in the class room.

When I played football I kept my grades up to Bs and As because my parents were really strict about me playing sports. They wanted me to foucs on my grades more and if I couldn't get my homework done then I had to quit.

Education is way easier to get a job with than sports. 1 of every 25 college football players makes it in to the NFL or the National Football Leage. I know that if I was the principal of a school, you would at lease have to have a B average with some As. So yes I think that you have to have a B average to play sports or do other activity's.
