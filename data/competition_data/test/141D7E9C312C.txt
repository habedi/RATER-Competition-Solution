Global warming is something that is very dangerous and something that no human should ask for. But by driving a car on a daily schedule thats basically what your doing. A car is one of the main causes of air pollution, and when humans use it so many times in a day it doesn't make that any better.

Their are many places that notice the increase in global warming so the country reduces the amount of car usage. According to Source 1 "70% of Vaubans families do not own cars." and "Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States." So the question is why isn't the United States doing something to stop the amont of air pollution in our country? Paris is another country thats doing something for this cause, Another source states "After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."

Those are not the only two countries that are taking action for this cause. In Columbia they have a day called "Car-Free" and it is a program in which the only things allowed are hiking, biking, skating, or even busses or taxi's. The gol of the program is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. But this could have a negative impact on car companies like Ford and much more. Source 4 provides us with some information on that, it states "A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23% betweent the years 2001 - 2009 In the US."

So fellow citizens dont you think its time to make the change and act upon it? Limiting the amount of usage of your car would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety. So next time your driving in your car just remember that it could be hurting the environment.       Â
