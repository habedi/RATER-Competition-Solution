Driverless cars seem like they would be a good idea and could very so work, under the right condidtions. Like the author said, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?" That is a very good question considering people that drive with children or just starting out. I personally think that a driverless car could work if everyone would still be alert and aware or their surroundings. Some Companies such as Tesla, have aleady projected dates to when they plan to release a driverless car.

These cars have sensors on them almost everywhere on the car that alert you when you are about to hit something or tell you when you need to start taking control, such as in a traffic jam or if there was an accident on the road. Televison and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. And now that we finally have that technology, we are taking the next step to better safety, more quick and effecient driving in some cases, and probably more money in the pockets of these creators as well.

The people at Google making these cars seem to be very confident and sure about what they are doing. These cars would almost be used as a texi service or bus transportaion. But, they would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. So as far as I am concerned, driverless cars would be a great idea.
