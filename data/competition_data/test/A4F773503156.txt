Dear Principle,

Kids at SCHOOL_NAME should be able to participate in sports, even if they have a grade C average. Grades shouldn't have to interfere with sports, their are two different subjects. they are both very important to kids. There are three reason why kids should still participate in sports even with a C average.

The first reason is, some kids that want to grow up and be a pro soccer player or a pro football player don't need school for it. Kids want to dedicate their time to sports to get better at it, and not on homework or studying. For some kids spots is all they think about because its their dream to become a pro soccer player or pro football player.

The second reason is, sports sometimes aren't the only reason why kids have a C average. So why would sports need to be taken away for the grades if playing sports isn't the problem. Kids might have a C average because they don't try in school or they need help on what their learning. Principles and parents should encourage kids to do their work, study for tests, and help them. They will still have time for sports and to improve their grades.

The third reason is,
