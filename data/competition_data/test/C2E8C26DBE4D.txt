Do you want to go on a little adventure and save some animals? Well then you should join Seagoing Cowboys program.

You get to save some animals and while your doing that, you can see some things you haven't seen before and be on a adventure.

After the return trips we play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals have been housed. We also have table-

tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading, and whittling. Here it from me, Luke Bomberger. I had no idea that my life would change when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. You know, being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up a world for me. I'm grateful for the opportunity that I got. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

That's why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I'm sure it will change your life just like it did to mine.
