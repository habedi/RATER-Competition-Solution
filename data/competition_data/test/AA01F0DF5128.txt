Hello! I'm Luke. I joined the Seagoing Cowboys Program and you should too. I loved it since day one. You should join this program because it is a great learning experince. I just could not say no when my friend Don invited me to go, I mean it was an opportunity of a lifetime!

First I went to New Orleans, the crew and I arrived there on August 14th. I got there the day the Pacific war ended. We got our seaman's papers and headed for Greece. We had 335 horses a long with us plus enough hay and oats to feed them! I will tell you what though you get attached to these sweet and loving animals.

I turned 18 before arriving in Greece. Instead getting drafted to the military service I got to keep going on with my cattle-boat trips! You should join because instead of fighting you could be on a ship full of lovable animals! By the time I was discharged I made nine trips! I think I broke a record of the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy!

I hope to see that you have joined this program, just like I have. Think about it you get to be with a bunch of adorable horses. You don't have to go to military services. Going to exotic places is a rare oppertunity...unless you join the Seagoing Cowboys Program! I can not wait to see your dission.
