You ever been with someone that thinks something true but really not. Well I have. And one thing that people think is real is the face on Mars was created by aliens. But clearly the face is natural landform. So today im going to give three reasons why the face on Mars is a natural landform on Mars.

Well the first reason the face on Mars is just natural landform because people have checked back since to see more evidence. For example on April 5,1998 Mars Global Surveyorflew over Cydionia. Michale Malin and his Mars Obiter Camera team took a picture ten imes better than the viking photos. Than they put the picture on the web whene revealing a natural landform. No alien monument after all but even after that people still wasn't satisfied enough so sooner or later they did it again.

So on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor went close to Mars for a second look . They rolled the spacecraft25 degrees to the center of the face in the field of veiw. Then Malin team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera maximum resolution. Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best1976 viking photo. You can see in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixek size. So if thats the case if there was any objects like spaceships on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks we could see what they are.
