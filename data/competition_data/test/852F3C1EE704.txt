Students have always wanted to have a way to leave school early, ether because of a valid reason or just because they wanted to. Students could be surveyed and the results would very much so show that almost all students can admit to this. This has left the discussion of whether or not to much school for some selected students is healthy. A few solutions for this problem conclude, shorter school days resulting in a longer school year, eliminating Monday from the school week, and the ability to take classes from home. With this being said more schools should provide the option for online classes to benefit students who could use it, such as children with a learning disability, anxiety and or depression, and students who are ill.

Nowadays more and more children in the United States are being diagnosed with ADHD, ADD, and other disorders that may cause a learning disability. I myself was diagnosed with ADHD and know that sometimes it is very hard to focus with lots of distractions going on in the room. To help students who also suffer from these problems, at home classes would help them benefit. With the ability to work at their own desired pace students will lose stress and work more fluidly and even become more independently thinking. While working at home there is also less distractions going on, such as a friend talking.

Another group of students who may benefit from online classes are children and teens who suffer from extreme anxiety or depression disorder. These students may dread going to school and just the thought of it may freak them out, for example someone with social anxiety might not even want to go out into public because it could cause a panic attack. People who suffer from depression may see a lot of life as stressful or worthless and when they are put in a state where they are being stressed, such as presenting a project in front of class, they find their self gaining a higher level anxiety putting them into a deeper state of depression. Quality of life is important, and there should be ways to work around these problems, like taking classes from home. In doing this students will be surrounded by an atmosphere they are more familiar to when placed in there own room, resulting in less stress and happier environment.

Additionally, students who are sick weather it be from the common cold or a disease such as cancer, should not have to go to school. With colds constantly going around schools students are faced with missing school and missing work. Since some illnesses may cause a student to be out for more then a week, making up work can be difficult and their grade could reflect it. Providing classes at home will prevent the spread of viruses, like the flu, and give students with more concerning illnesses time to rest and finish there work more at their own pace. This would also solve the problem of to much make up work since the students can just work on it while away from school.

Providing students with online classes is surly helpful and could open the door for more students to really blossom while learning because of the environment they are in. I have experienced being home schooled myself and even though it was not really for me because of the lack of people around me that I was used to, It was still helpful because of the weight of not having to leave or be distracted off my back. Some who may disagree may say being at home is just a distraction of itself and there would to much to do, well trying it out is the only way to find out if this is true. The best way to implement this is give students to ability to do both, learn at school or at home, and not worry about attendants. The option for students to be schooled from home or school should be left to the student and his or her parents to decide once they are able to see and reflect on their grades and quality of life after trying both ways out.
