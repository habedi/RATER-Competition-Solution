In my opinion i think that using the technology to read emotional expression is a cool, fun, and exiting thing to do, when the author explained the instructions and how everything workes it wouldnt be something i would go against because if the technology detect that someone is sad or someone is acting like they are happy but really are upset it has a way to make people feel like they are truly appy so if somone puts on a fake smile it will make the person actually feel joyful. The author explained it in the story where he is telling the readers the instrustions in paragraph 9. Also it would awesome if we would be able to detect excactly how people are feeling even though they are showing something they really dont feel because that way we know if someone needs a laugh we could help or if someone is feeling grumpy we would know to not even bother that human.
