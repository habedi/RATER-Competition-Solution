I belive what Luke is doing is grate to be helping people form all these diffrant places.

Luke became a seagoing cowboy because of the once in a lifetime opertunity and it helps somany people.

Luke and all these other people are giveing so much like food, animals, and goods like spices and seasons.

Seagoing cowboys Have to be on a boate for weeks ans sometimes months to ge to these places.

All the people who do these thins are some good good people.

When Luke turned eighteen he was drafted into the millatary.

Luke was doing these trips full time now.

Helping people whos citys were left in ruins.

When luke dose these things I bet it makes hime feel good knowing you're helping others around you.

Luke got deported after nine trips.

He sailed the Atlantic sixteen times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by World War 2.
