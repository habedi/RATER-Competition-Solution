Imagine going to the last day of the school year. Imagine the fun summer that is waiting for the span of about two months. Now... imagine enjoying the last week of the summer vacation, but then realizing there is a summer project assigned by one of the classes due on the first day back. Following a teacher's directions while doing a school project can be difficult some times, especially when the teacher did not give their email/contact information regarding on the project. Therefore, who is going to help explain the instructions? Projects should be fun to do, not tedious based on teacher's instructions. So why let their minds go to waste as the years go by, when they can explore the world through a more interactive, more attractive kind of way? Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows a creative aspect in specific students' minds, it can help them stay on top of the assignment at hand while being interested, and it helps the teachers themselves by looking at different ones from different people and viewing the topic in different perspectives.

Creativity is where the mind of most people take a different turn on certain topics. Creativity should not be kept in a box, it should be someplace else: a wall, a canvas, paper, books, music- everywhere and anywhere it can and should be, as long as it is not crammed inside; sitting there as the dust falls on the area, leaving it gray. Although some students may say that they are not creative, or not that innovative- but they most certainly are, they just need a small extra push in the right route. The reason why they are so negative on being creative is because that little part of the brain labeled 'creativity' is covered in dust. Their minds are plagued by the dust, and they are not reaching their full potential of creativity. Creativity is how a person views the world through their eyes; not through their friends' eyes, or through their parents, or school, it is through their own. It is imperative that students really take a try at being creative because it opens their eyes to a world full of other possibilities. They will see the world in all of its colorful splendor. Homework assignments, classwork... all boring assignments when the teachers give specific instructions on how to do them. Not very creative, and not that very thought-provoking either. It bores the class being swamped with regular assignments. But, when a group project comes around, why is that subject the only one being touched on through creativity? That, is very limiting. Every assignment should have an option; an option that can give a better grade on creativity than a normal, typed up/written assignment because it is important to not keep the creativity stuck inside the students' minds. All while they are touching up on their creativity, they are more invested at the task assigned to them.

Investing time, is time consuming. To be fair, it is supposed to help others be more organized, or to be more punctual, but how? Sure, the teachers can say that it is going to help them continue learning throughout the summer- that is filled with fun plans along with enjoying time socializing with others, but everyone knows that they are going to do it either the first week of summer or the week before it is due. No in-between. Summer is supposed to be enjoying, not filled with dread and anxiety of a school project. But, if a little creativity is sprinkled through the instructions, then students will be a little less stressed and anxious about finishing the project because they are the ones who are making the rules and the guidelines of the task. That, is more eye-opening than paperwork that relatively looks similar to parents' taxes and bills. Adults always tell the 'young ones' to do something that interests them more. Sports? Whichever appeals to their eyes and their physique and how much they can take. How many times has someone asked, "what do you like?" Countless of times. How many times have they actually answered with a straightforward answer? Sometimes. Being interested on assignments are important, because this gives students more elbow room to work with than a structurally four-by-four square box with a pencil, eraser and paper. It helps them work with an open mind, it helps them stress less and turn in the project on the first day back, brimming with confidence. Creativity is to be shown to others, including the teachers who assigned the task over the summer.

Classes can either be a very hands-on type of experience or a very claustrophobic one. Teachers are somewhat under appreciated. They are either too strict or they are just simply "fun" to hang around- they can be boring and monotone or they can be interesting and colorful. Everyone has been through a lot of teachers, but when have they ever been through a teacher who was strict, yet fun at the same time? Very few have. It is like

Goldilocks , when she tries each porridge, each chair, then each bed. Those teachers make everything "just right" for students. When assignments come around, every teacher is staring at the same black and white sheets of paper, but if they were to look at different ones- different styles of writing, different colors used, different methods tackling the subject, they would not have to strain over Times New Roman font text or illegible handwriting. Overall, it benefits the teachers by showing how the students viewed the assignments and how effective it was when it was assigned.

Finally, students should have their summer projects based from their own rules because it helps them focus more, it helps them take a break from the regular classwork, and it helps teachers have a refresher to look at. It benefits everyone in the long run. It gives a sense of accomplishment because they did well on the summer assignment. A good grade to start off the school year, along with a good, fresh mood to start the year off. Find a colorful, more creative way to start the year off.
