I feel like the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable for a lot of other things, but I don't think it would really be valuable for seeing what emotions students have because you're going to have a lot of students in a classroom with all different types of emotions. Plus what would it be good for anyway? Why would you need to know the students emotions? I think that it might be an invasion to privacy. I don't think everybody wants people to know how they're feeling and what emotions they're having.

Trying to get information from somebody you don't really know is an invasion of privacy in my opinion. I don't want a teacher that I barley know or if anybody trying to use this know how i'm feeling cause I just don't want people asking how I am all of the time. So if i'm sad and they use the Facial Action Coding System they'll probably think i'm always sad or depressed and feel bad for me and I don't want people feeling bad for me. Or if i'm mad and people know i'm mad and try to talk to me about it and maybe I don't want to talk about it, it would just make me even more mad because I already don't want to talk to anybody.

I think this technology is a great idea dependingon how you use it. Maybe cops can use it so solve crimes and it helps them out, that would be a good use for it. But if you're trying to use it for information on people and knowing what they;re feeling like all of the time isn't cool in my opinion. And maybe people are curious to know what kind of emotions people are having in very old paintings, that would be a great idea. In conclcusion identifying humans emotions is a great idea to not only solve problems but for just being cruious about how people are feeling in not only pictures but in videos to.
