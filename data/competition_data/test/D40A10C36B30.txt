STUDENT_NAME

When most people think of school they think of learning, which is true but to a point. School doesn't just focus on the academic part of learning but also the physical and moral traits also. Most students have physical education classes that keep them in shape physically. But most of the time their isn't much academic enhancement through physical exercise. One might think the same about community service, that it is just physical labor that doesn't help you academically. Doing community service does more than that, the real reason for community service is to help people in your community. Helping people builds character and helps you to grow not academically but morally. These morals are what you need in the long run to becoming a better person. This is why I think students should have to perform community service around their community.

For example, if I exceed academically

I probably am really smart and will grow academically in the future. Without the kindness and obedient attitude I can receive by helping the elderly cross the street then I could wind up using my academic talents for doing the wrong to someone mentally or physically that can get me in serious trouble. If I exceed academically and use the morals I have learned, then I will use my talents for the good of other people. If all students performed community service than it would make the world a better and safer place. This is why I think community service is important for students to perform.
