Dear Senator,

I am writing this letter to discuss the Electoral College. I have read some interesting facts about the Electoral College and I believe changes need to be made. The people of the United States of America should be in control of who is elected. It should not just be a group of people from each state that is allowed to pick.

I am not the only one that feels this way. In the source "The Indefensible Electoral College:

Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" it says, "According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortley after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."

It is wrong to have the people vote for people to vote for the president. If someone wants a certain president to be elected, but they don't know who the electors are going to vote for then how do they know which elector to vote for? In the source "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" under the "What's wrong with the electoral college column" it says, "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."

In conclusion, I say abolsih the electoral college! I am not the first person to say that either.

Bob Dole also said"Abolish the electoral college!" It is not a fair system to use. There is plenty of evidence to show that the majority of the American people are against the electoral college.
