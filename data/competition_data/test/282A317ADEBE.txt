Dear senator we know that there been many changes in the united states of america voter increase there equal right to vote for the president of the united sate. but does the electrol college work? yes becuase if there was not a electral college to vote we wouldnt have a president in the united state. We just need to follow the govermentÂ  step to consider there vote. but the electral college consists of 583 electors that means that everyone had the right to vote.

We all have the right to vote because many people dont have the chance to vote for the united sates president so do you think we would have the chance to vote. n and can imagrats vote to thier part of the state we have a big population of imagrant in the united sate they are hispanic, lations. we had save the imagrant because we all vored to come to the united state to serve a better life taht they coulnt have in there counrty. so we all have the right to vote in the congress constitution

Do we all to serve the right in the united even if they are not from the united sate .the population grows even more with the imagrants the reason we have to vote for them was becuase they need a better future to help there family. senator i would say not to change any of the decided thing you would want to do to the voter in the united states.
