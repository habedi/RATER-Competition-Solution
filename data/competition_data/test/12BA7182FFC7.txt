Studying from home and learning from home is the best thing only for the simple fact of being in the comfort of your own home and being able to take it to your own pace and not get lost so easily is a crucial part for when students are trying to learn. For example, in classrooms there are students who do not let the teacher do her job and make a ruckus in the room to the point where the teacher has to stop the learning process and take care of the situation. Then you are left aside wondering how to do a certain problem or not understanding well and need help. It is not easy to be in a noisy disruptive classroom while you are trying to learn and others block that from you as opposed to being able to be home in your room or in your dinning room and take all the information needed in and learn the proper way. There are many advantages as to why learning from home is a better opportunity and why it will have a better effect on people trying to learn a certain subject and being able to learn it to the point of being able to teach it.

Another example of how learning from home is a step up from going to school is if you are a single mother and you work two obs but are trying to progress in life, move on, be a role model, and give a life to your child. When you are a single mother and you have to take care of another life that is not just your own, its hard to find a moment to relax and try to relieve yourself for a moment and do something that interests you. Online courses help these types of people that dont really know whats going to happen in their day and may not know if they will be able to attend class if they go to an actual school for these classes but with these classes they can start or stop whenever they have the time to learn and relax at home with a cup of tea, a note book, and a pencil. This opportunity to take classes at home is great and should be recommended for people who have busier types of lifestyles or have a better underst6anding when it one on one.
