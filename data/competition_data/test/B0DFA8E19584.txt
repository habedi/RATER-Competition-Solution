Dear principal,

I believe that students with a grade C average and below should still be qualified to play sports and other activities. First of all, I think that the students applying for sports or other activities with a grade C average or below should be encouraged to get better grades in their classes, but not banned from sports completely. Secondly, sports have no association with academics. Sports can be played with education primarily based on that particular sport. Next, I believe that more students would be more physically active if more students were allowed to participate in sports. Lastly, I think that students have the ability to raise their grade while in sports or other activities and those activities could possibly encourage the students to raise their grade. In conclusion, I understand that you only want privileged students to play sports or other activities, but I disagree that students with at least a grade B average are allowed to play sports or other activities based on the reasons I have presented you and I strongly consider that you change the policy.
