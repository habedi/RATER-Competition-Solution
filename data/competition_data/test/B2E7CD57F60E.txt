i think policy 1 is the one you should pick because what if something happens to you at school and the principal doesn't let you use your phone during your free time but it would be good too if you dint let them use them during class because then they could get distracted or even cheat at a test lets say you are at lunch and a thief comes up to you and tries to take you with him or her and there's no people around you to help you whose going to help you then if you cant use your phone because your at school but then if your in class and you are doing a test and you have your phone and you happen to not understand a question and your teacher went to the restroom and you use your phone but when you are nearly going to text someone the teacher comes in and sees you and she could take your phone to the principals office and give you a referral or the phone can ring during class and distract others doing work so my honest opinion is policy 1
