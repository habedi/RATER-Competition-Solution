In this article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile". She describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. According to the passage, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," I can agree with Mona Lisas demonstraion that, If a classroom compter could see your emotions, I think the information on the web will be much more interesting until the computer sees that your emotions are acceptable. Havin this computer software, kids and adults of all levels can read people more easily and try to help them. Wether its in school or at home. Kids can learn easier and understand more with this computer software. In passage 6, "Most human communicaton is non verbal, including emotional communication," Dr. Huang has a good point. Most human communication is non verbal and hard to read emotions. Having to see or tell will have a lot more communication. Less problems will suddenly appear. In conclusion, The use of this technology could be helpful becuase it will help people understand students ouside of school and inside of school. Students will become smarter because a computer ad can make sure they get better information if they arent interested. Teachers would would have an easier time teaching as well.
