Would you like it if you were forced to do something you don't want to just because someone said so? The principal of my school has decided to make every kid do an extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because some kids would rather go home and have time for themselves, some dont have time, and others might have to much homework or chores to do.

One of the reasons that I disagree with this is because kids would rather have time to their selves instead of worrying about other things. They're some people who like to spend time by themselves than with other people. Most extracurricular activities are after school, kids after a long day at school would want to go straight home to relax. Kids already feel tired and stressed because of school, so adding a extracurricular activity they would feel more exhausted. Since they already feel worn out they most likely not give their 100% to what the extracurricular activity. The students might just not have any interest in any of the activities the school offers.

The second reason is most people don't have the time to be able to do a extracurricular activity. People dont have time usually if they do a sport thats not associated with school, or if they have appointments they need to go to. If a person were to join a sport in school they would have to be driven at whatever time the practice starts, but the person may not be able to go because they have something else more important to do. If a student does a extracurricular activity it can take away their time from something they need to do. A student might have to pick up their sibling from the bus stop or school because no one else but the student is there to pick their sibling up and take care of them. If the student were to join a sport they wouldnt be able to pick up their sibling or take care of them.

The last reason is students may have to much homework to do or chores. The student is probably already stressed, so if they were to join an activity they may give her more work the student has to do. The student will feel exhausted and pressured to do everything which isn't good for young students to go through. Most students have chores they have to do like cleaning their room, wash the dishes, or to take out the trash. If the person does a extracurricular activity they'll not have enough time to do the things the person needs to do. A student may have a job to do an extracurricular activity can be difficult because the student may need to change their shift and the manager might not have anyone to change their shifts with.

In conclusion, the principal should not keep enforcing this rule, students should not have to do a extracurricular activity if they don't want to. The first reason why is because some students would rather not do one if their not interested. The second if they don't have time because they have other things going on and the last reason is they already have to much to do. Students should have the choice to chose if they want to do a extracurricular activity or not.
