Sitting at a desk for seven straight hours is outrageous. It's difficult for students who have a short attention span to maintain focus in school and acquire all of the information they've learned from their teachers. This issue, however, has been significantly resolved by the impact of technology on education. Some schools give students the opportunity to attend classes and learn by accessing through an online medium from home. This way, students can manage their time wisely to not only gain focus from breaks but also other acquire benefits that could improve their life. Because students can have time to partake in valuable activities that could positively influence their college admissions and are enabled to improve their health, all without losing the motivation to learn, distance learning from home through online or video conferencing gives students a greater advantage over learning in physical classrooms from time management.

Online school stimulates students to participate in valuable activities, such as volunteering for the good of the community, acquiring a paying job to support their family's income, and getting an internship, since they are able to have free time from controlling their time properly. All of these aspects can help colleges to understand the students' personality to determine whether or not to have them to become a part of their institutions. For example, the University of Virginia would rather accept a high school student who had an internship in a medical field that they immensely wish to pursue than accept a student who had no exposure or experience in the medical field. This is because the college admissions can see the student's determination and confidence in oneself. As a result, the student who had a medical internship would have a very high chance of being hired as a physician assistant, for instance, once he or she is completed earning a medical degree from UVA. This illustrates how much an impact online schools can have on the future lives of high school students, by giving students an opportunity to manage their time properly to convince college to see the good side of them.

Despite that, online classes also gives students another advantage: sleep--the most fundamental aspect in a high school student's mental life. It's vital to understand that sleep allows students to be productive and energized to perform various tasks throughout their school day. However, preparing for physical school limits their amount of sleep. For instance, many high school girls take a long duration of time to in the morning to put on makeup, shower, critically match their outfit for the day, etc., for school, so they decide to wake up early to complete all of those tasks. This proves that these actions can reduce a tremendous amount of time of their sleep to get ready for school. On the other hand, the ability to stay in and attend classes online excuses students from doing all of these time-consuming tasks to get a sufficient amount of sleep. They can simply wake up and attend school with a click of a button.

Some critics may say that online classes encourage students to cheat during assessments, using their online resources without having supervisors to stop them. This causes them to lose motivation in learning. However, some schools require them to take their assessments in person which will thus motivate students to learn for their own good. For example, Generic_City Public Schools give students an opportunity to take certain courses online but require students to take their midterms and finals in person at a designated school with the students' online teacher. This way, students are unable to cheat during their exams as their teacher is constantly paying close attention of their actions, thus motivating them to discipline themselves and ensure that they are learning what they need to learn for their own benefit.

As students are able to manage their time wisely, attending online classes from home is tremendously beneficial for students, due to being able to have a healthier body and use their free time on important tasks that can help them build an attractive portfolio for colleges. It's crucial to understand that not only their education is important but also the students' life, including their future. Furthermore, high school students should take advantage of the new technology that the world has provided us, especially by taking certain classes online. Technology is constantly changing to make our lives easier, so it's reasonable to take advantage of what technology has given us.
