The planets are a fasinating part of science. They have charateristics that we can not even imagine and facts that we long to learn about. The mask that apeared on Mars was first spotted in the year of 1976. I can strongly say that the face on Mars is not created by aliens. I know this because scientists figured that is was a butte or mesa- landforms that are common around the American West. Also when they shot the pictures it was taken during winter when it is normanly cloudly, not a good time to take a photo.

The face on Mars is not a alien creation, but is a Marian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. This implies that the science behind this, is that the landform on Mars is non other than a mesa. Scientist also know that mesa landforms are common enough, especially around Cydonia. This shows that the unusual formation was definatly a butte, but this one just happened to make it look like a face.

In 1976 a Viking shot a photo of a face like portrait. This was taken during winter a cloudy time of the year. This demonstrates that this picture is not the most reliable photograph. And so On April 5, 1998 a team of MOC researchers went out a took a sharper photo,much more reliable thean the original Vikings photo. This reveils that the landform was very much a natural landform. Though this rock formation did very much resemble a human head, We know that this mesa was created by shadows not aliens.

The face on Mars show us that things may appear different from what they seem. Next time lets just leave it to the experts to tell us the science behind things.
