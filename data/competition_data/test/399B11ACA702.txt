Dear principal,

Students should be required to perform community service to help out the community. Students should be required because if students have must attend community service they may learn to not liter and it may instruct them a lesson, knowing that people have to pick up things that students drop on the floor is hard work to clean up. Also it should be a must because it keeps our community clean and nice, and is respectful to help keep the city clean.

Students should also be required to help out by such as tutor low level students. If students tutor elementary students it may help them learn better. Sometimes students understand more when it is being taught from a different kid. This could help students learn how to do there work in various ways.

Community service helps younger students to do work in class, and keeps places clean. Helping out is also a kind and courteous way to show people you care about people and the world. So students should be required to participate in community service. They should be necessary minimum once or twice a week and get some type of reward for helping out the community to make it a better place.
