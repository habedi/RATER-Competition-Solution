I think people should become a seagoing cowboy because you do alot of things. Like raising some cattle like cow and horses. Play games on the way home like vollyball. Plus you can visit places like italy and china. You can feed cattle or work the night shift its fun.

You can raise animals. Like cows because there are alot of young cattle on the boat. There is 335 plus horses on the cattle boat plus loads of food so you can feed them which is kinda helping them live so they can help other people that were affected by world war 2. Plus the cows can give them meat and milk so they can feed their famliys.

Plus you can have fun on the way home by playing games. One of the games are baseball/softball which is played in the place the horse and cattle were. one other one was table tennis which is basically ping ball but was called table tennis. We also did tornaments with the table tennis. There was also boxing. reading was also a option with whittling wood was also a nother free time.

One of the best reasons for going on these trips are the place we went like china. You had time to tour the city you went to on the boat. so you go to new places on these trips like to castles fameous citys and things you can think of. I went to so many place on this trip so i hope you do too.

In conclusion i say you go on these trip because they are fun but dangerous i cracked a few rips on a night shift and almost fell overboard too. so don't get to excited because you can get super hurt on these things because i didn't get hurt to bad does't mean you can't get hurt that bad. But i still think you should get signed up. Its super fun but you can get super hurt. ive made alot of trips and helped alot of people more people than trips.
