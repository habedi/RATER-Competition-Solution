Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 would be a good policy to have because, if students were able to have their phones with them and be able to use their phones they wouldn't have their phones taken up as much during class, parents wouldn't complain to the school about their kid's phone, and kids would learn more. As a matter of fact, one time I was in the lunch room eating lunch, talking to friends, and texting my mom on my phone. Then a teacher comes up and tells me to give them my phone but I refused to and yelled at the teacher and told them I was talking to my mom about tutoring after school. The teacher still wound up taking away my phone, when I got home I told my mom, she called the school and complained to them about it all.

First of all, students would not have their phones taken up as much during class. For instance, the students can text their friends, family, and boyfriends or girlfriends during free time and wouldn't get into trouble and have their phone taken away. Plus they could also tell the people they are talking to when they had to go so they could text them later. Also, with students being allowed to have their phones out during free time they'll just have more time with their phone, which means they will just the more quickly die out on the thrill of having a phone. Then they will most likely have their phones with them gradually lesser and lesser.

Secondly, parents wouldn't be complaining about their kid's phone anymore. Just like the story i told you earlier about me texting my mom, and then my mom complaining to the school. With less phone calls to teachers and to the principal about the phones the teachers will have more time to do the work they have rather then deal with a phone problem. Also, with the complaint level going down over the phones stress in school teachers will go down a lot. So I think that the parents complaint levels lowering would be a very good thing.

Thirdly, kids would learn a lot more. I think this mostly because, the kids wouldn't be obsessed over trying so hard to text someone and they will actually learn something in class. An example for this topic is, I am not going to lie, there are some days when I just try to text and don't learn anything. I
