Dear Principal,

My view on the change of the grade to play sports from a C to a B is a very good change. I like it because you are trying to make the students work a little harder. Also, you are trying to make the best of their education which is a great idea. You are trying push the students a little harder which is good.

Being an average student is not that bad but, it is not that good either. You are making a right decision about changing the grade from a C to a B. You are trying to make our school also a better choice for more students to come to our school because we can give a good education to the kids. You are trying to show more expectations for the student who knows they can do it, but need to try harder to play any sports because people might think you are bad in school and the coach might take you off the team.

So I think you are making the right decision by changing the grade to do any activity in school from a C to a B.

Even though people think it is a bad idea because they are the C average student and they don't want to try harder to get a better grade in their classes. They think they can do great things in life by being average but it does not work like that. You have to be an A B student to get some where in life so you have my vote to change the grade to do any activities from a C to a B. So do whatever is necessary to help our students get better.
