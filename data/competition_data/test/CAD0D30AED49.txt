Dear principal,

You should not require community service. If people don't want to do it then that's their own opinion. And some people also may not have the time to do community service so don't push it upon them to do it. Some people think helping the community is a nice and good thing to do them let them do it maybe you could have an activity for people who would like to do that and they could get extra credit and letters of recommendation for something. And the people that don't want to do it maybe are against it for some odd reason but then again they might just not have the time to do it, they might have cheer or dance, baseball, football that kind of stuff going on after school. But also the people that don't want to do it you could just ask maybe say here try something new you might like making the community cleaner or a better place.

Here's and idea if some students get in trouble say for littering or for bullying, getting into fights, never turn in the homework, are disrespectful and disruptive to the teacher and to the class then they could do community service for 2 days or so it could depend on how bad the case was. Cleaning up the environment and making a better situation out of something would maybe make them realize what they have done and they may not do it anymore.

For people that would like to do community service maybe you could get them to have their friends that don't want to do it try it. They could let them know that it makes you feel good about yourself and makes you feel like you just helped a lot. And maybe they will even end up liking it a lot you could create a little club for the people that like it and have them make posters for community service and on them say you could get extra credit, letters of recommendation, and be recognized with the group that they are doing the service with.

So i hope you take this letter and think about what choice you will pick on your little conflict.

Sincerely,
