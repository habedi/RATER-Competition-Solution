Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To many people our world has become a giant trash can, and that is not good for our planet. Requiring all of the students to perform community service is a great idea for many reasons. Following through with community service will provide animals a better home, more people will want to live around here, and over all just make the world a better place.

First of all community service will provide animals a better home. Trash lying around could hurt animals. For example, plastic can holders with the holes in them can hurt Dolphins. If Dolphins get there mouth stuck in it, their mouth will be closed shut and they can die. When trash is lying around animals home they don't have a place to sleep or take care of their family. It is very hard for an animal to live when our world is a dump.

Second of all, more people will want to come live around here if our planet is clean. When people are searching for a nice place to live in and they see trash everywhere its not very welcoming. They won't want to live there, they will want a nice place to live in where everything is clean and not disgusting to look at every time they walk outside.

Third of all, Our world will just be a better place. More people will want to vacation her or live here. The more population can mean the more buisness or money. Going to the Beach on a sunny day will be more exciting without trash lying around when you just want to play in the sand. Walking to where you want to go instead of poluting the earth will be more peaceful and nice without having to dodge trash on your way.

In conclusion, that is why i think we should require the students to do community service. It will give animals a better place to live, more people will want to live around here, and it will make our world a better place over all. Maybe you should consider this idea. People will appreciate our community service because it will make our planet cleaner!

Sincerely,
