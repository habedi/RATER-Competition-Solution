There is many advantages to limiting car usage. There's less pollution emitted into the atmosphere, Safety is reassured, Time is saved, resources are conserved, People seem to relief stress being car-free.

I read a passage called "In German Surburb, LIfe Goes On Without Cars," by Elisabeth Rosenthal. In the passage Elisabeth wrote about how Residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars. 70% of the families in Vauban do not own any cars, and 57% of the families there sold their cars to move here. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," Said Heidrun Walter as she was walked down the verdant streets. Vauban was completed in 2006, this movement of seperating suburban life from auto usage is called "smart planning." This movement can help a lot with the current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. This movement is happening all across Europe and the United States. Europe is responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe while it's up to 50% in the United States. Vauban is home to 5,500 people, it's basic precepts are being adopted from all around the world to try to reduce car usage, to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. They're making stores a walk away on a main street, rather than in malls that are quite a distance. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting something new called "car reduce" communities.

In the second passage I read called, "Paris bans driving due to smog," by Robert Duffer. In this passage Robert wrote about what happened in Paris; It enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. Motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, odd-numbered plated cars would have to do the same the next day. With this in effect, 4,000 drivers were fined that's atleast $124,000 American dollars; Congestion went down 60%. With this partial ban the smog cleared up enough on Monday for the ruling of French Party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

In the third passage called, "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota," by Andrew Selsky. In this passage Andrew wrote about a day in Bogota, Colombia and how this "Car-free" day impacted not only the City of Bogota but two other cities and probably another country. On the "Car-free" day in Colombia many Colombians hiked, biked skated or took public transportation. The goal of the whole event was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog or get a $25 fine. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. This event can start a chain reaction and inspire other countries and nations to take a step to reduce all the pollution being emitted into the atmosphere. For the first time in the three year spand the event was held, two there cities joined Bogota. Cali and Valledupar joined in on the "Car-free" day in Bogota, Colombia. "These people are created a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders," Said Enrique Riera Mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay.

In the last passage called, "The End of Car Culture," by Elisabeth Rosenthal. In this passage Elisabeth wrote about how in America more Americans are buying less cars, driving less and less people are getting their Driver's Licenses. Driving decreased a 23% between 2001 and 2009. Experts say if this trend of buying, and driving less cars continue it'll be benefical implications for Crabon emissions and for the environment. The reduced usage and buyage of cars has a negative and a positive effect. The positive thing about it is that it's less pollution into the air, which means less Greenhouse gases, less traffic, and more safety; but it's negative effect is on the car industry their profits will plumet down quickly. As a result of this issue to the car industry Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world with personal vehicle ownership is impractical; He's going to partner up with telecommunications industry to create cities where "Pedestrian bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are a connect network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions adn improve safety."

In Conclusion, all of these factors like creating communities where there is no access to cars, banning driving for a couple days, having a car-free day, or just coming up with ideas of making self-sufficent cars can all lead to less emissions into the air and creating less smog; reassuring the safety of pedestrians; and conserving resources. These factors are all advantages of the idea of limiting car usage.       Â
