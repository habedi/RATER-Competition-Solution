Certain schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that the students are still learning throughout the summer. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures preparedness, challenges students, and protects students from forgetting material.

To begin with, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures preparedness for the next year's curriculum. For example, a teacher assigned a summer project for her students, and the project she assigned gave the students insight for the upcoming lesson plans. This helps students so that they will be ready when the next school year approaches. This idea proves teacher-designed projects are superior to student-designed projects because it keeps students prepared.

To further explain, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it allows students to be challenged. If teachers made the projects; then the students would be challenged and also be given a chance to expand their way of thinking. This gives students an opportunity to grow their mind and face problems they are not used to. This idea proves teacher-designed projects are superior to student-designed projects because it challenges students.

Also, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it protects students from forgetting school material. If students practice and participate in teacher-designed projects; then students will not forget the lesson applied. For example, a student was given a long-division packet to complete over the summer; therefore the student will not forget how to do long-division since he practiced over the summer break. This idea proves teacher-designed projects are superior to student-designed projects because it protects students from forgetting material.

Although, some disagree with the position and say student-designed project are better because students will want to do the work if they designed it. This idea is wrong because the work the students create will not be sufficient enough for them to improve. Some also say the student-designed assignments will make the work more enjoyable. This idea is also wrong because the teacher-designed project would challenge students.

Overall, teacher-designed summer projects are superior to student-designed projects because it ensures preparedness, challenges students, and protects students from forgetting material. Some disagree and say student-designed projects will make the students want to do the work, and the projects would be more enjoyable. Those ideas are wrong because the student-designed projects will not be sufficient enough, and the teacher-designed projects will challenge students. In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are more beneficial.
