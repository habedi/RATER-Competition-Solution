Some school are offering classes were students can attend at home, the classes can be online or by video conferencing. Schools have been offering students classes that the students can take at home, but will it help the students? Some could see it both ways depending on the student, and how the student learns the best. Some students may benefit from attending classes from home, but some students may not.

Students may benefit from attending classes at home in the way, that some students may work better and or harder if they are working alone and one on one. There are students that know what they are doing and can figure it out on there own, but other students may not be able to. I do agree that the online classes may help some students, and some students may succeed in the classes.

Other students may not benefit from attending classes at home, some students may work better if they are with a teacher. There are many students that understand the material better if a teacher explains it to them one on one, or in a class. Students may find it easier to learn hands on, and have a teacher explain, and show them, and help the students understand the material.

Schools should offer classes that can be attend at home, because students can benefit from the classes taken at home. Also schools should let the student decide rather he or she would like to take the online classes, no school should just assign a student an at home class if he or she dose not want the class. Students will and can succeed in the classes attend at home, but other students may not be able to.
