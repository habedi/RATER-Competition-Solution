To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME

Many students are complaining to teachers that they have nothing to do after school but play video games and hang out with friends and family

I agree; 60 percent of students in our school just go home and do homework, their should be after school activities for kids who at least past with an 75 average in all academic classes. Not all kids can have higher than a B average in every classes.

I think if students want to do after school activities and there grade is lower than a 75 they should first go to after school tutoring to get extra help and bring there grade up.

Doing both of these things will keep kids with better knowledge and become more healthy by playing sports such as football, basketball, soccer and other kinds of sports students will stay out of trouble doing bad things like stealing and fighting. Over time kids will develop better social , mental , and physical skills. Our neighborhood around our school will be more safe and will keep a lot of kids off the streets and away from trouble. Kids will want to join sports and other activities.

Please and thank you for your time.
