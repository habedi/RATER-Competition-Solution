Well in source 4 i think kids are getting few licenses because there droping out of school and hav no money and smoke to much and to many different type of drugs. now dont get me wrong not all kids a like thhis but a good 40% are like this. the thing is the people spend to much time in the car there should be a car limmit like more joy rideing for more than an hour or no just driving to drive because you want to. the world need the learn how to put things in moderation. the world today is to codependent we need to be more independent i mean less pointless use or cars or buying and using things we dont need. like more car the more cars we buy the fast the air will thin and so many bad thing will come from that. to make a car free day it would cost the USA more money to have a car free day that to find scientist and try the find a better way of using fuels so what i am saying is unless you get every one here to start hating driving it wont be a car free day ever in the USA.

in the world they need to have one whole day car free i do agree i just really dont think it is posibale to get it to happen to many people work to far from home and need to travel for work.

???OK BYE NOW???
