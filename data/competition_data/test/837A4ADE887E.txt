Dear principal

I think students should be required to perform community services.

We should be required to perform community services because it will keep us out of, harms way and it will keep us out of trouble. Also it will help us make right decisions through out our lives.

well first of all doing community service would keep us out of harms way.

I think it will keep us out of harms way because what if you can imagine your self going home and some random strangers come and start to harass you. Then all of a sudden one day instead of harassing you the stranger just kidnaps you. I' d think i would do community service instead.

Second i would like to say that doing community service would keep us out of trouble. lets say that we go home right after lunch and go do bad things with some friends of their's. Now lets mixed up and say that he had community service and that if he missed it that he or she would get in a lot of trouble. So instead they would stay in school and not be in any trouble at all.

For the last reason i said that it would help us make right decisions in our lives.

What i mean by that is, imagine just a little thing you change in someone's life like giving them community services after school. They would probably end up think about actually doing good in school and getting a great job by adding one small step in their life. I mean just consider it, it might save there life.

For my summary i would like to conclude that giving community service would keep us out of harms way , keep us out of trouble ,and it would help us make the right decisions in our lives. For these reason i have written i wish you may consider.
