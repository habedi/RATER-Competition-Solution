The thing about the face is, everyone was hoping for a Martian. Thats why so many people were still not saticefied when they saw the second. It isn'tg easy, you know. They all have to do extremely hard work to just get a glimpse at the "Face." We have done multiple photos of the face and around the face. If we were trying to hide something, why would we show it to everyone? Those are the crazy things I'm talking about. Un-needed sceptics and conspiracy theorists to question the goals of NASA as a whole, just because we found this and shared it with the world.

There are forms like this all over the world. You can find formations like this anywhere, like in deserts, on rocks, theres no end to it! You can find unusual formations all over the world. However, when its another world, its a completely different story? No. Mars is a desert, and why cant formations like this be found there? The truth is they can. This just seemed interesting so we wanted to share your possible discovery with the world. NASA would have loved to find out that it was a Martian, but that wasn't the case.

The article states people who have seen things like that in the desert. There are multiple whitnesses of that. So in the conclusion of my arguement, I'd like to state, that I believe, and you should to, that the "Face" on Mars, Is just a natural formation on the planets amazing surface.
