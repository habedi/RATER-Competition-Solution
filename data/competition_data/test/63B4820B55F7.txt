Imagine living in a world where children were healthier and adults actually cooperated well. It almost seems perfect right? Well, this is what our society could look like in the future if students were required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should be obligated to be involved in at least one after school activity because the child would be healthier, more social, less stressed, and more disciplined.

Extra curricular activities, such as playing sports, can benefit the student's well being. The child would be kept in shape and would be more physically active. Keeping the child healthy could benefit him or her in the future by adding to the child's life span. Sports will also decrease the high obesity cases in our country. Obesity is a common issue in America due to the millions of fast food places and the limited exercise options. If the younger generations were forced to exercise, Americans would be more healthy and fit in the future. Students will not only be getting physically healthier, he or she will also become more mentally stable. Mental health is a common issue for children due to the excessive workload and pressure that school forces onto us; sports will provide an escape for the students. These are just a couple of the reasons why students should be obligated to be involved in at least one activity after school. The child will be healthier, happier, more mentally stable, and our obesity issues will decrease in our country.

Some might argue that the students will be overwhelmed with extra activities but I strongly disagree. After-school activities will provide an escape for the child from the real world. Activities such as a book club, yearbook club, and a sports team can all provide different environments for a student to go to when feeling stressed from school or his or her life at home. The student will also learn to have a better work ethic, as well as a better understanding of discipline and cooperation. The student would not get stressed from these activities because the child would be too focused on improving him or herself.

After-school activities will also help the child be more social. Being in different clubs or sports teams will expose the child to more social interactions, which can benefit his or her social life with friends and family. The student will also learn how to work better with other people in the community. This can help the community cooperate better and will improve the lives of many people. After-school activities will prevent the student from experiencing social isolation aside from school interactions with teachers or other students. He or she will learn to be a contributing member to the world. The student will be more disciplined which will help future work places run smoother. These are just a couple more reasons why students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. The child will be social, more of a team worker, and a better person in the society.

All in all, requiring students to be involved in any form of an after school activity can strongly benefit the student and society in the future. The students will be much healthier, more socially active, and the student will also develop a work ethic and learn self discipline. The society will also benefit from the involvement of students in extra activities because the child will grow up to be a cooperative and disciplined adult/ worker.
