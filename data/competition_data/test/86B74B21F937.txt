Car usage can effect the air causing smog and increasing the amount of greenhouse gasses in the air. This isnt good for the enviroment and its not good for us. Having fewer or no cars can help us in many ways including lowering smog, lowering greenhouse gasses, and releaving stress from us.

To start off, I want to say that I agree with getting rid of car usage. I believe it can really help everyone and every thing by lowering the amounts of smog in the air. Bogota has a car-free day that seven million people go along with. Within that day, they can see the difference in the amount of smog in the air. For travel they would hike, bike, skate, or take busses. Even if it is raining, they would sill do it because they know it helps. These car-fee days promoted alternative was of travel for everyone. Paris also enforcedÂ  a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. A little later two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event.

Secondly, he smaller amount of cars decreases the amount of greenhouse gasses getting pumped into the air. The pesident of the United States of America stated that he was tring to curb greenhouse gasses. The pesident of the United States of America then said that studies have proven that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses ever year. America, one of the highest rated, car driving countries has decreased and keeps decreasing its car travel. This will steadily help the atmosphere of the Earth by lowering its grenhouse gas consumption. Emissions fom cars is Americas second largest source of emissions behind power plants.

Finally, the lack of cars releaves stress from eveyone. In a German suburb, life goes on without cars. Every day people are happy and have less stress without cars. It is a car free area, excep for the main throughfare which you cant even hear over the laughing children and bicycle wheels. Seveny percent of the families dont own cars and fifty seven of them have sold their cars to live there. This city is one example of a growing trend in Europe. The United States of America, and elsewhere. This movement is called smart planning and it seperates suburban life from auto use.

Inconclusion, car usage can effect he world in a bad way. Whether its the enviroment or the people on the world. Having fewer, or no cars can help us in many ways including lowering smog, lowering greenhouse gasses, and releaving stress from us. Many areas and people have done something to help with these problems, and you can too.
