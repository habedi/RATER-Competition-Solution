I disagree with making kids stay after school for an extracurricular activity because what if you have sports that you do after school and you can not go, or what if they have some where important to be at, or they have a lot of homework to do but they cant finish it because they are still at school.

One reason I think making kids stay at school is a bad decision is because what if they have somewhere to go but they cant because they are stuck at school. Like what if they have to go to a doctors appointment, or maybe they have to go to the dentist. They might be able to call their parents to pick them up but maybe they can't because their parents are not at home and their parents are working are working and the buses wont take the students where they need to go because they have a specific time to go to the school and come back. School is very important but staying after school for something that dose not help you create a future is not worth wasting time while they could be at home studying or doing something that helps them do better in school and might give them a future.

Another reason I think making kids stay after school is a bad idea is because some students have sports that they play after school and they might not be able to do them anymore because they have to stay after. I have a cousin that lives in San Francisco and her teachers made her stay after school. She had soccer practice after school that day and she could not go because she had to stay at school. So when she went to practice on the weekend she got in trouble by her coach and she got kicked off of the team. The team that she was playing for was a good team. I mean some people might find staying after school is fun but other people have places to be and they can't be where they need to be if they are stuck at school.

The last reason I think making kids stay after school is a bad idea is because some students get a lot of home work from their teachers and it takes a lot of time and making them stay after school takes away their time to do it then they will end up staying up late and not wanting to come to school the next day because they are too tired to think or learn or do more work. Doing homework is a good thing so that their teachers know where they are in they subjects and what they need help on and what they are amazing at. If staying after school takes all of that time away then their teachers won't know how to help them.

In conclusion I think staying after school is a bad decison becasuse students ahve sports that they do and making them stay after school wont give them enough time to go, some students get a lot of homework from their teachers and staying afterschool does not gve them enough time to do it and then thy will have to stay up late, or maybe they have somewhere important to be and they cant be there if they arwe stuck at school. that is why the principle should not make the kids stay after school for something that wont help them get a future and become someone important.
