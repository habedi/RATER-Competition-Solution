How many times have people missed school because they were sick or missed the bus? Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, since they would not have to miss school just because they were ill or could not make it to school. Children tend to miss school because they fall sick, and cannot risk spreading any illnesses that they might have. Students also are late to catch their bus at times, and that causes them to either be late or not show up to school at all.

Most students tend to stay home when they have fallen sick or have any injuries that make it difficult for them to show up at school. Most times parents also prefer that if a child is sick, that they should stay at home, and not go to school. When some children fall sick, it could be very severe and they could have trouble moving from one place to another. Many parents believe that a child should not be sent to school when they are sick, because that way the sickness could spread. Sending children to school when they are sick is not very common, especially if the sickness is contagious or severe. Having the chance to attend classes from home makes it easier for those who tend to fall sick easily or have a contagious sickness.

Some students, that do not have a ride to school and have to take the bus, can also end up missing school or being late to school since there is a chance that they might miss the bus. Many children miss the bus, because they oversleep, cannot make it to school on time or at all, because they do not have another way to get to school. Some children also live far from where their school is, so they do not have the option to walk. This problem would not occur if the students had the option to take a class from home. Online learning makes the timing more flexible for the people who have a hard time being punctual. By taking an online class, the students do not have to worry about being late for school.

Although online classes seem like a great idea, some people argue that, by taking an online class, the students do not get to go out as much or be sociable. By taking online classes, students can choose to stay at home, but that makes them less active. A lot of people would rather stay cooped up at home than go out, but going outside is beneficiary since it gives people a chance to breathe fresh air, and take in Vitamin D from the sun rays. Taking an online class also means that the students might not interact with others as much any more, since at home, they do not have people their age to talk to. By physically going to a school, students have the chance to connect and socialize with others, but taking an online class can make the students not as sociable anymore, since they do not have anyone to talk to.

Taking a class online is beneficiary to students, since they will not have to miss school just if they fall ill or miss their school bus. Online classes make it so that the students can do all of the work that they need to do for school, but stay at home while doing it. Online classes are a better option than physically going to school for children that have a weaker immune system, which allows them to get sick easily. Students do not have to worry about getting up early in the morning just to get ready to go to school if they take classes online, they will have more time to themselves and will not have to worry about being punctual. Taking classes online can make it less likely for students to go outside more, but they will have more time on their hands, and with that time they can decide to go out, and do more things that they like.Â
