Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I heard that you would like to change the grade policy for sports. I would like to tell you why you shouldn't do it. Many of us students are very good at sports, and we represent our school very well in sports. Many students have a C average ,and are very good at sports. If you were to change the average we would have all our players that have a C average would be off the team, and wouldn't be able to represent our school like they used to.

I am a player myself and I have a B average, but I wouldn't want my team mates with a C average to be off the team. We are like a family and losing players or team mates would hurt us. I know we have to be in school also, so we can arrange that in practice for an example we can have our first hour of homework or tutoring, and the rest will be our practice. If you see that we are getting better in school please change the policy we had already witch is change the average back to a C.

Thank you for hearing my letter and I hope you change your mind about the B average.
