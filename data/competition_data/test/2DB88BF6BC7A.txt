Limiting car usage is a very good idea. With limiting car ussage there are many advantages such as no pollution, decreasing stress and excercise.

First of all, with not much car use you wont have pollution. There won't be any sickness from air pollution. If there arent as many cars then pollution will decrease. According to "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, Paris stopped car usuage due to record high amount of pollution. With this policy it decreased congestion by 60%.

Secondly, with limiting car usage means decreasing the amount of traffic. I know that everyone gets stressed by the amount of traffic there is on roads. I hear everyone talking about it. According to "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota." by Andrew Selsky, decreasing the car usage increases improvements in the community such as new sidewalks, and a big change in traffic times for the better of course.

Lastly, excercise is very important and could be a major reason why we also stop usign cars. In a car you dont get to enjoy outside or even relax. With a car there is a higher percentage for a crash and most crashes are deadly. But if you start walking to school or work or church, you can get your excercise and also get some fresh air which includes Vitamin D. According to Mr. Sivak in "The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, he says that his kids "can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends." Just by giving up a car does not mean that you have to give up having fun.

In conclusion, a decrease in car usage would be a very good thing. We could all get more excercise, decrease pollution, and decreasing stress. What's better than decreasing more stress than you already have? Nothing!
