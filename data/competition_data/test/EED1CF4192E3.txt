A face on mars sounds kind of creepy right? How much do we really even know about it? Many scientists believe aliens created it. Others like me believe it is just a natural landform.

If it was to have been created by aliens it would have been more detailed. The Face on Mars isnt very rare as you think. The face is equivalent of a butte or mesa like the one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The whole thing is just a conspiracy to increase

NASA budgets. The NASA took a picture that if there was any sort of airplanes, pyramids or small shacks they would have been seen, but none were found leaving no proof that any alien civilization reated it.

Do you still believe there is any sort of connection with aliens? I dont believe so because we would have discovered them by now. NASA has given enough information to prove it is just a natural landform like any other on Earth.
