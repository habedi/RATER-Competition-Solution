Dear Principal,

I think that both policies are good but I would rather policy 1 because you would have more kids not leave school early or skip school or get in much trouble. The only thing though is that I don't agree in having them out in your main course classes. For example math, science, English, and history. You might not get what I'm saying or maybe you do. The point I'm trying to make is at least make it where we can have them out in the hall and extra fun classes also our tutorial classes. The only thing your thinking about when i say a lot of kids wont get in trouble your thinking, "yes they will and this is a bad idea to do this" but no not really all you have to do is send a letter to all kids saying that they agree to NOT have their phone out in their main classes. If some students don't turn in their agreement then you write their names down so you know but most likely your going to get every ones agreement because anyone would love to have their phone at school at some point. Just think back when you were in this and you had a phone wouldn't you want to bring it to school and play on just a little in the extra classes that we had? You should try for just a month and if you don't like it you can change it back to normal.

I think that more people would love coming to school if this and dress code both change.
