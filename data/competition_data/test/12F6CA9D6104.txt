In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile." The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, Which could be a good idea for students in school.

The Facial Action Coding System could come in handy in many ways. If a student is at school and they are watching a video online where a person is trying to describe something or inform them of something and they are confused and the computer notices it, it could show them to another website that could help them understand it better. It could also inform a teacher that a student needs help. Another reason this would be a good idea is if a student isnt having a good day and they are upset and the computer recognizes it, then the computer could transfer them to a page that could cheer them up and put a smile on there face, which could help them get through the school day. It could also send a signal to a teacher that could lead to help from them. Another reason i suggest this tool is if a student gets very upset about something and the computer notices it, then it could help a teacher get a councelor if the student is having problems at home or with other people in the classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System could also come to help for students who might be suffering from depression and no one noticed the computer could help.

Therefore I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is a good idea becasue it could lead to some positive outcomes.
