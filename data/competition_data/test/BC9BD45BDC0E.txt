Many people would agree that technology plays a huge part in their everyday life. Technology has advanced drastically in the past decades. It changes the way we communicate, the way we drive, and the way we gain information. Technology is even changing the way school systems teach kids. This change is not only coming from inside the school but outside the school also. Offering online classes to students is more common now than ever. Schools should not offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home because they will not be motivated enough, it will be easier to cheat, and it exploits you from necessary social interaction.

Teens are not motivated as it is. The teenager years are very stressful because these are the years you are transforming from kids to adults. This is the time when your "fight or flight" cuts on. When stressed teens have a pile of homework to do, it is less likely for them to fight through it instead of pushing it off to the next day. That is unless they have people pushing them to get their work done. In an ordinary classroom, it is really embarrassing when you are the only one that did not do your homework. You often ask around the classroom to see if anyone else forgot to do it or you rush to do it so nobody notices. Students who do online classes are in an environment they are comfortable in and do not feel pushed. They will be able to do their work at their own pace, but a teen's pace is not fast enough to succeed.

Think about how many students cheat when a teacher is hovering over them; the answer is none. Students are less compelled to do right on their own. Like mentioned before, these are the years were teens are not kids but are not necessarily adults. As a student, you do not think about actually gaining the information, you just think getting a good grade. This could result in students looking up answers on their phone, using the textbook when they are not suppose to, and calling up friends for the answers. It will be harder to crack down on cheating if the school system gives students responsibility that they can not handle.

School is not only the place where students learn, but it is also the place where they make friends. If the school system was to create distance learning an option, they would be depriving students from social interaction. Creating these bonds is necessary for good mental and emotional health. Without these connections, it would be harder to communicate and make personal relationships when entering the real world. Many say that online schooling could prevent negative things such as bullying. If online school is one of the best options to prevent bullying then the school system has bigger problems to focus on than making distance learning an option. School is a part of preparing kids for adulthood, so it would not make sense to let them hide behind a computer screen.

While technology is one of the best advancements ever made, there is such thing as too far. Bringing school into people's homes should not be an option because students are not motivated enough, it will be easier to cheat, and it gives less chances of social interaction. While our school system has been strengthened through easy access to computers, technology should not take over the school system because it will deprive us from lesson needed to succeed in adulthood.
