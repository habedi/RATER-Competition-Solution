Driving is fun of course, making plans with your friends, going out, having fun but it can also impact your life because this world isn't perfect and there could be worst times in your life or better days. It could be times were you crash or get stopped.

So in my honest opinion humans shouldn't be using cells phones when they are driving because it could cause a big accident and can even risk taking their own life. Many people drive and text and their so entertain with their phone that they don't keep up with the road and sometimes lose control of the wheel.

Not only do people use their phone but they wonder off to space or some are too busy looking at cars or doing their makeup. So it is wrong to use your phone while you in the car driving it can do major stuff you can even get stopped by the police by texting and driving. People should be more careful on driving. You might not sometimes take your own life but you can take other people life by doing a major crash. So people who are so addict with their phones shouldn't be driving for many reasons. And should let someone else drive.

Like phones can ruined so much in society and can cause a lot of damage. So I am very against on using phones while driving. It's like most of the drivers I seen are on their phone and don't see when a green light or red is on or when there's stop texting and paying attention to the road or you just don't care signs or any other kind of signs. So it's either you save your life by not driving and keep having your eyes off the road and do a major impact and crash.

In conclusion, overall driving and texting is bad. So yes, in my opinion I think you should save your calls and messages for later and pay attention to the road so you can get safely to your destination and be glad nothing happened on the road because anything can happen in a heartbeat.
