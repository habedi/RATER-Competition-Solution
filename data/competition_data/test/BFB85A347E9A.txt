I believe that this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a great idea.

"A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused and borde." "then it could modify the lession, like an effective human instructor."

the same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive --- for video games or video surgery.

It would be a good change, it could cange our lives for the better. A computer that can tell our emotions could bring us so many opportunities.

i see why some people might not feel the need for it simply because , we have teachers and they can tell our emotions or some perople just might think there simply isn't a need for computers to know how me feel by our facial expressions, they may feel as if its pointless.

But i do truly feel as if is a good idea to have them, they seem fun and really cool . something that can benifit our lives in so many different way , and it could possibaly be used as a fun little toy on the side. but all together the idea is great.
