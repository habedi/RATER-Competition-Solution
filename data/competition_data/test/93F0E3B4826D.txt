The principle deciding that you have to do an extracurricular activity is like your parents choosing clothes for you and then they say that you have to wear them. Most people don't want to participate in extracurricular activities because they already have too much to do and they don't have the time. I disagree with the principle because students may have other things to do outside of school, there may not be anything that interests the students, and the students may already have other activities that they participate in.

One reason I disagree is because students could have other things to do outside of school. The students could be babysitting their siblings, doing homework, hanging out with friends, or the may have a part-time job to earn money. For example, my older sister couldn't participate in extracurricular activities because she had to babysit me and she had her own homework to do. Sometimes my sister hung out with her friends, as well. Babysitting requires attention of the sitter, and doing homework takes concentration.

There may not be anything that interests the student. Some activities could be limited and may only be there for a few days. In some schools there are things like that. There's an after school activity that you could go to and it's not there for more then a few days. One of my friends went to an activity and the day after she was happy and sad at the same time. She told me that there was a new club there and that it was really fun. She then added on and said that it's only there for two more weeks. She didn't go to after school, unless a teacher asked her to be there.

Another reason is that the student could already have other activities that they participate in. The student could already have sports to play, like soccer, basketball, baseball, or football. They could also be on one of the schools sport team and could already be there for the training. For example, I have a cousin and he is in high school. He is also on the schools soccer team and he has to be stay after school everyday for two hours. Once he gets home, he does his homework, eats, and then goes to bed. So, he doesn't have the time or energy for extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, having to do extracurricular activities is not a good idea. Students have other things to do, they may not like what choices they're being offered, and they may already have activities that they are participating in. The principles decision is like your parents choosing clothes for you because it may be nice, but you don't want it. You may be happy about it in the beginning but then you realize that you didn't have a choice in the matter.
