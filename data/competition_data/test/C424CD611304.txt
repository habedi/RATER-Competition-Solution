Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students which is a good thing because students can benefit from learning at home. If they are getting bullied in school they can stay at home and learn, if they have something wrong with their body they can still learn from home, and you can make your own food and eat the food you have available to you at home instead of school lunch. These are only some out of the many benefits for students that go to school and want to have an education but struggle to do so because of school.

First, some students in school get picked on and bullied for no reason, which can lead to very bad health problems. So, instead of the student moving schools or having their parents pay for them to go to a private school. The student can do distance learning, which allows them to still get an education from their own room. With being able to distance learning they can avoid all of the people that bullied the student and make them feel better about themselves.

Secondly, there are always students that get into a bad accident which causes them to have a bad injury. For example, a student breaks their leg and struggles to use the crutches and doesn't want to go to school. The student can simply stay at home instead of stressing their leg out and just take online classes. Therefore, they won't have to be in as much pain from their body while trying to learn in school. If they can't do online classes and decide to stay home they will miss out on the lessons being taught in school by teachers. Distance learning should be available to any student because it can be very beneficial to the student.

Third of all, some students do not enjoy school food and will go the whole day without eating because they think it is nasty, which leaves them to stay hungry for 7 hours of the day until they get home. When taking distance learning, your parents can go grocery shopping for the student and get them the food they desire. The student will then be able to make their own food and enjoy it instead of waiting all day to get home just to eat. Eating good can make a student be more productive throughout the day and strive to do more work for school. Also, while they are learning or doing work the student can grab themselves a snack while they learn and won't have to worry about disrupting anyone since they will be at home learning on their own.

Finally, Schools offering distance learning would be very beneficial to students if they are having a hard time in school. Distance learning would let the students be able to avoid bullying, be able to do school work at home if they are having issues with their body, and they can make their own food at home which would be more enjoyable for them than what the school serves for lunch. There are many other ways that distance learning can benefit a students life and make them feel much better than going to school everyday. Every school should offer something like distance learning to help out the students that they have enrolled to their school because you may never know what is going on in their personal life.
