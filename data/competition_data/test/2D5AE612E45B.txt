Imagine a planet where there has been no known life, then flying over it and seeing a face staring back at you. That is what NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft saw when it was circling the planet Mars. Few think that the face was created by alien life. The face on Mars is a natural landform.

The face on Mars is not an alien monument. On April 5, 1998 a better picture was taken of Cydonia, the picture was ten times sharper than the original picture. The picture revliled that it was just a natural landform. That is was not an alien monument.

Scientists at NASA compare Cydonia to natural landforms on Earth. The chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program comared the face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, a lava dome that takes teh form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Not everyone believes that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. Some conspiracy theorists claim that is is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. They also say that NASA is trying to hide that there is life on Mars, but defenders of teh NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Theorists belives that the face is a alien monument. The older photos make the Face look like the head of a Pharaoh, bu the clearer pictures form 1998 show that it is just a rock formation.

For some it may be hard to believe that teh Face on Mars is just a natural landformation. The more recent pictures prove that Cydonia is a rock formation. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform like the landforms on Earth.
