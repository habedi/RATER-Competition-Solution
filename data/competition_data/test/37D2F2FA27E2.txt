Many people might think that the face on Mars was created by aliens and many others might think that it is just a natural landform.

There is no proof for any of the rumors.

People have had clues about them.

Some say that it looks like an Egypitan Pharaoph, others say it looks like a river from Idaho.

The face has become so popular that it was starred in movies, magazines, books and talk shows.

It was so popular because it was unusual.

NASA knew once they showed the public the picture they would attract more attention to the planet Mars.

The Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia and took a picture that came out more clear than the first picture that NASA took.

To get the picture was hard work.

They usually do not pass over Cydonia very often.

There is a spacecraft that will fly over the location and scan it like a fax machine.

The picture of the face may mean different things to people and some may have different opinions about it.

One person said it looked like a mesa formed by lava.

If NASA done more research about the face in Cydonia they might be able to figure out what it is and what caused it.

Unitl someone says what it really is, it will just be a big mystery.

You can spot the head shaped figure from two miles away.

Photographing the landform became important to NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor.

They also felt that it was important for taxpayers.

No matter how cloudy or hard it was to see and capture the face, they still made it work.

The crew in the Mars Global Surveyor said there were alien markings that were hidden.

When Malin's team tried again to find another photo they went on a cloudless day and used the maximum resolution and got another picture.

When they used the maximum resolution you could see things that were even on the ground such as planes or pyramids.

They also stated that the landform was almost the same as a butte.

The landorms were common around the American West.
