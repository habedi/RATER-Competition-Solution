Dear principal

The argument I have with my principal is that she's wrong because if they have an C it isn't bad because if you have an C you are still passing but I'll understand if they had a D or an F but a C still a passing grade, if mostly everybody have an C average then her school wouldn't have an sports team. If her team have a C average then they can bring it up bring it up quicker Because it isn't hard to bring up a C

if they had a D average or an F average then it would be another story I don't think she Should change the School policy because she really wouldn't have any students that would attend her school but if she change the school policy then she might as Well change all the policy's that she Have at her school around because if she change one then she should change all. but if she don't considering changing the policy then everybody would play sports at the school, so that's why I think the principal should change the school policy, Thank you principal for listening to my argument.
