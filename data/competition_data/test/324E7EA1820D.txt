Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that cell phones should not be allowed at school. The only thing cell phones would do is disturb classmates, prevent student from listening, and cause interruptions. That is why cell phones should not be allowed during school.

The first reason why cell phones shouldn't be allowed during school is because it is disturbing class mates. If someone was sitting next to you in class and they are playing on there cell phone, you will be very annoyed. It will prevent classmates from learning if they are being disturbed by cell phones. That is why cell phones shouldn't be allowed during school.

Having cell phones in school will not just prevent your classmates from learning but you as well. If you are always on your cell phone then you are missing out on valuable information that could be on a test. Student need an education and you cant let cell phones ruin it. That is why cell phones shouldn't be allowed during school.

Cell phones will also cause interruptions. If you are texting your friend and your cell phone goes off, the whole class and teachers stop what there doing and look at you. Those 30 seconds waisted could have been information that you needed. Plus, you have waisted time so you couldn't have got done with all the work you needed to do. That is the last reason why cell phones shouldn't be allowed at school.

Cell phones are just distractions that are not needed in this school. Cell phones just cause young students from learning and they are losing there education. They are also taking away someone else's education and time. That is why cell phones should not be allowed at school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
