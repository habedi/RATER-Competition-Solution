To the principal

I'm writing to you on account of the idea requiring all students to do some community services. Personally I think that is a great idea, it helps students see the importance of helping out, and that it can even be fun sometimes. In today's world few people see the importance of lending a hand, so if the school would teach them the importance I believe more people would start to understand how important it is to do community service.

One reason I believe that community service at a young age is necessary is that in order to get into collage you most often need to have some sort of community service on your records.

My last reason is that in today's society work is not a well liked word. I'm being raised on a small farm of 14 and a half acres and I know the importance of work and how it is beneficial, to earn a job in today's economy your student
