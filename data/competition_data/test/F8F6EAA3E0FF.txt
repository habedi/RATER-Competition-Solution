Dear Principal,

Community service is great for the community. All students should have a required amount of community service hours. They should have required community service because, it sets a good example for the future, it is better than doing nothing, and it is better to give then receive.

Community service should be required in schools because i sets a good example for the future. Did you know that it is a proven fact that if you do community service once 74% of people will do it again. Also if younger kids see the older kids participating in community service then the younger kids are more likely to want to participate themselves. I can connect to this because i participate at my church teaching kids about God and other stuff about the church while having fun at the same time. Kids from my class have came and talked to me. It turns out that they would like to participate like me. Community service will only help the kids of tomorrow. Community service should be required at schools because it sets a good example for the future.

I feel community service at schools should be required at schools because it is better than doing nothing. Kids average 1-2 hours of free time. you can do a lot with 2 hours. Making service mandatory will fill that hole and help the community at the same time. One day i was texting my friend and he had nothing to do. I was working down at the shelter so I talked to my boss and she hired him. We had an awesome time. This really helped my friend. Community service should be mandatory because it better then doing nothing.

Finally, community service should be required in school because need to learn it is better to give than receive. For example, giving to someone else is better than receiving anything. One year for Christmas when I was young all I did was keep asking for gifts. Then my mom told me a story. She once helped her friend pick up litter around the school. The principal saw their work. He spread the word that these two girls were helping the community and willing to do anything to help. Eventually they got good paying jobs. They gave a little of their time to school and they got something back. Community service should be required because it is better to give then receive.
