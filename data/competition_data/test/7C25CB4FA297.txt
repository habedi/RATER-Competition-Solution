Drivers shouldnt be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Imagine having to spend time in jail or prison because you hit someone and they are harmed, in critical condition or worse, maybe even dead. Besides facing possible jail time, the guilt you would feel for that is unbearable. Which is why using cellphones while operating a vehicle is an unacceptable decision. Not only is it against the law, but for one it is harmful all around, and it is also a complete distraction.

Driving while using a cellular device is illegal. Often times if an officer spots you using a cellphone while noticing you are driving, he or she will pull you over and give you a ticket. For one that's a silly reason for getting a ticket. Now money has to be spent to pay the fine all due to the fact that whatever was on your phone was so important. In some situations there may be an emergency that is that important, but if that's the case you pull over then use your cellphone. Especially if the situation is something that can make you panic, you shouldn't be driving while in a frantic state.

1.6 million crashes a year are due to cellphones. That's a lot! More than what it should be, considering the fact it is against the law. Like I said before the guilt you would feel if you were the cause of someone's serious maybe fatal injury would make you feel horrible. Or imagine if something happened to your loved ones because someone was texting while driving.

If something on your phone may be very important and you feel the need to use your cellphone, then you should pull over into a parking lot or maybe the side of the road depending on the circumstances. Like I stated before if something tragic is happening and your getting a call of text about it the last thing you'd be worried about is the road. Which can can an accident or an almost accident. Or even when someone sends you something funny while your driving your not going to be focused on the road, your going to either be laughing or replying. Maybe even both.

In conclusion, don't let using your cellular device while driving cause you to be another statistic and have the 1.6 millions crashes a year go even higher. Which leads me to, once again, why using cellphones while operating a vehicle is an unacceptable decision. Not only is it against the law, but for one it is harmful all around, and it is also a complete distraction.
