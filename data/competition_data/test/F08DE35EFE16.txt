My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least onew school activity. I dissagree because mabye people just dont want to do an school activity it would be unfair for the people who don't want to do a school activity will the get a concequence what happens to the people who does not want to participate.

I think it's a bad idea because some people just get tired of school all day long. Some kids might be shy because they are telling themselves they can't do it so then they just dont participate. Sometime kids get tired of thinking all day and just want to go home because they be so tired o school. If it helped you leard and not just do things for fun mabye it would be a good idea but no it just fun and games sports will not help you count money math will so instaid of sports they need to have an after school program for real school.

I dissagree because when I get home from school I be tired of school i dont want to stay back and play sports or serve on the school council. School is a place of learning not just that it helps you in life and it teaches you life lessons and not only that it puts knowlage in your brain about your bast your future and how to count 123 or say ABC that is school no some play house. I like school just the way it is with student in class learning it might be boring but it will help you in the future.

That is why i dissagree because what is going to happen if you don't participate nobody wants to get punished for somthing they dont want to do so i dissagree with the principal because it's not right on the kids who don't want to participate in that activity.
