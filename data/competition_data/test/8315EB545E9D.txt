I think you should and should not change that policy because of several reasons but the biggest reasons are because most students will not have an average of a B. And the kids that want to be in sports will maintain there grades at Bs.

The reason why I think students who want to be in sports or other activity's will not be able to maintain a B average in all classes. Most student that go to our school are more social than others from my point of view. Kids in preschool are exited to come to school everyday and want to do school stuff and don't hang out with other kids. By time going by and them growing up to more social they are and wanting to go to the movies with friends and not do there homework. And when that happens in time it brings there grades down from A' s to B' s to c' s. then they manage for the rest of there school time to mange that grade. Maybe sometimes students don't care if they have good grades or not but want to be in sports then they will maintain there grades at an average grade for it.

The reason why I think it should be changed too is because a person who wants to be in sports will try to keep there grades at a B just so they can be in sports. The kids will push them so they can be in sports. they will push for something that they want. Most kids would try harder for something that they want.

Those are the reasons why I think they should and should not change the policy about the grade average from C to B to stay in sports or other activities.
