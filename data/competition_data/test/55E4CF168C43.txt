When it comes to knew things in technology usually everyone jumps on the bandwagon but in some cases you shouldn't just because others will. When it comes to your safety and peace at mind you should make careful decisons of what potential danger you might be putting yourself in, especially when others are involved. When it comes to driverless cars I stand on the opposing side. I don't think driverless cars are a good idea because they can be costly, dangerous, and give people the impression that you don't need to know how to drive.

These smart cars can be very costly when you think about it. Driverless vehicles are new to the world, with new technology come new bugs and manufactoring errors. For example, one day you could be "driving" down the street and one of your sensors don't go off and you run into something. Thats money out of your pocket to fix the damage of your car and whatever or whoever you hit. Depending on how bad it is it can even cost you a lawsuit and medical expences. Even if they do find a bug in your car you're still expected to pay for a replacement and whatever you hit.

Smart cars can also be very dangerous. It is mentioned that there are several occassions where human service is needed in case of work zones and around car accidents. In the event that you might not be paying attention you could potentially run into a work zone or car accident. These are only two things but these two things can still be dangerous and even life threatining under certain circumstances.

Last but not least driverless cars can put new drivers under the impression that you don't neccissarily need to know how to drive. This is putting other drivers at risk as well. Teenagers and adults with driving permits that try to drive the car will think they don't need to be as aware as they would in a regualr car. Without that sense of alertness in case of an accident or malfunction a person might not know what to do or how to operate the car.

Overall I think that it is a bad idea to have driverless cars because they can be costly, dangerous, and give new drivers the impression that they don't need to know how to drive.
