. Phones & Driving

While using your phone anywhere sounds like a fun idea, it may not be the brightest idea... while driving. Technology is definitely a stepping-stone for all entertainment as a whole. Back then, in a not so distant past, people had to find things that entertained them, like objects around the room. There honestly was not much to do. Then came the commercial distribution of the home television. Eventually, almost every home in the country had at least one television. At that point, people could watch films and shows from the comfort of their home, instead of getting dirty or injured outside. Many years later came the technological advancement of telephones, known more modernly as smartphones. Smartphones were definitely a huge step in technology, because now you can take your entertainment with you. However... it may not have been the best thing.

Obviously, with this sort of convenience, people developed a way to multitask while using their smartphones. However, when something requires your utmost attention, like driving, that would be when you should probably put the phone down. However, using Bluetooth to answer calls is highly acceptable. The main problem at hand is looking at your phone while driving; it is a safety hazard. Now, there are pros, just as there are cons.

Texting while driving is now just as illegal as not wearing your seatbelt in Georgia. That does not mean you cannot use your phone for other things though. Cell phones have many different tools that can help you. Like a compass, or a clock, or especially a GPS. Obviously, you will not need a compass unless you are following a map in your car. The GPS, however, is a perfectly good example as to why using your phone while driving is a good thing. All you do is enter the address/coordinates and you just follow the route, while occasionally checking your screen to see if you are on track. Perfect for multitasking in the car.

Now onto the cons. There are excessively too many cons for you to even consider using your phone while operating a vehicle. The amount of distractions and casualties the problem creates should be more than enough to convince you to put your phone down while driving. Not only are you putting yourself at risk by doing this, but also anyone else who's near you on the road. So many people are injured and/or killed every year because of someone's poor decision to multitask, when their hand should be on the wheel.

To sum it all up, it can be both a blessing and a curse. You benefit from using phones and driving in some ways, but also risk harming others in the process. Texting while driving is not worth more than your well-being. If you are going to bring your phone, at least be smart about it. If not, you might end up like every "texting while driving" story; dead or severely injured. Just... think about it.
