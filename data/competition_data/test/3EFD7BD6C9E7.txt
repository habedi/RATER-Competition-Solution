In the story I read there was a man named Luke, he was a Sea Cowboy. Luke had gone off to sea to help check on cargo. others need to partcipate in what Luke did. If nobody else helped Luke he could have been all alone. If you were Luke would you help ou still work your two time job?

Luke had a friend named Don, wich if it wasn't for Don luke wouldn't be out there. Luke was working a two part job one at a grocery store and one at a bank. Then Don told Luke to go to on Europe cattle boat,and Luke couldn't say no. It was an opportunity of a life time for him.

It was 1945 and World War 2 had just ended for Europe, and many contries that were in war was nothing but ruin. So some people's job now were to help those contries get back in shape, so 44 nations came together and formed a UNRRA. The UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of animals that were shipped over sea, thats what Luke and Don sigend up for.

A lot of people may say this task is verry dangores and that nobody should do it. But if Luke and Don didn't help ou then a lot of people could die because they have no shelter or food. They helped by going to Greese with horses for all the people and food for them and the horses.

Luke had turned 18 by the time they got to Greece to help out, but turning 18 also meant that he could be drafted to war. By 1947 Luke had already made nine trips to help people out. Nine trips was the most any "Seagoin Cowby" has ever went before.

In this story I read there was a man named Luke and he became a "Seagoing Cowboy". Luke helped out so many people on his journey. It was important that people would help Luke out. A lot of people would say that this was dangores and noby should do it. So like i said before, if you were Luke would you go and help our would you still work your two time job?
