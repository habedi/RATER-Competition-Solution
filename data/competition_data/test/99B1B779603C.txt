Dear Principle

I think that students should be allowed to have cell phones during free periods and lunch times. I think this because students use cell phones during those times anyway. Students can use cell phones during school without getting caught during school and don't really care if they get caught. Allowing cell phones during free time can let them check things like e-mail or facebook and let them talk to there friends.

Anther reason to allow cell phones in school is that they can lead to better grades. This is because if students can use them during free time they won't have to use them during class witch can cause them to pay more attention to the subject. If students pay more attention during class it can lead to better grades.

These are the reasons i think cell phones should be allowed in school. i hope this affects your decision to change the cell phone policy in school.
