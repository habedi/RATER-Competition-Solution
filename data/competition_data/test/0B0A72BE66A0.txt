Dear Mr. Principle,

I think that it should be required for students to do community service but the hours they are required to do should be little/small. I think that the required hours should be little because some people don't want to do it so therefore everyone gets a little if what they want.

I think that community service should be required because first of all, it helps out the community in many ways. It gives people help that they need and deserve. It also gives the students a good feeling that they helped out someone in need. And if you are lucky, the student could like doing community service and do it over the summer or other vacations. Second of all, the students don't get paid so it saves the town money, money that should be spent on more important things. Some people or store owners don't have a lot of money to spend but need the extra help. It also helps the kids get into college. If they put that they did and x amount of hours doing community service onto he/she's application, then the college that he/she is applying to while obviously see that as a good thing.

I think that there should a small/little amount of hours is because the students that don't want to do community service said that there is then not enough time to do things they like or more important things. In order to appeal to that group, the small amount of hours would let them do the things they said that they couldn't do. Since it takes time away from the student doing homework, playing sports, seeing friends and family, the small amount of hours required would let them do those things and let them do community service.

I hope that you agree with me and my plan into consideration for the good of the town and the students in your school.
