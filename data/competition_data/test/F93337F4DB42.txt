Dear Principal,

I have major questions

Why are you doing this to us? Many kids our age have many hopes and dreams of sometime in our life become athletes. We may not have the best grade ever but they could be one of the best athletes in the world who knows. A grade with a C average is not failing its just some students may need to have more attention in the teachers than others.

Or maybe we just need to do our work. In Some Occasions kids our age whom fail their classes, every time a sport comes out and we try to pass every single one of our classes. That's how important its. I think that this is not fair, its like taking away something that you love When you don't do your chores perfect as they asked, I mean at least you know you tried your best, but it wasn't much, It didn't come to fool you. Even though are goal here to pass everything should be a high expectation, For some kids its just to pass with a C . Kids In our age love some sports they may even have a passion for it already. For example for me my passion is to play soccer. Its to have fun, Enjoy life. But still you are taking some opportunities away from us. We don't blame you for anything it just gets us mad and disappointed. Please change your mind about this. Thank you for reading this letter I hope you actually listen to us.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
