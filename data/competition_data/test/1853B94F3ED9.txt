Dear principal,

I think it would be a great idea to maintain a B average to play sports. Most people have C averages ,so by doing this it will encourage them into making better grades. If we made this policy come true ,then we would more than likely have a better overall school average. All school want to have the best grade point average ,but we could be at the top if we had everybody here make a B average or higher. So when students find out that they will have to maintain a B average or higher to be able to attend in sports they will start studying more making better grades. That is what we all want. So then if all the athletes have a B average ,then we would have a higher school average and be smarter as a school. Now, we have about half of the grade with a C average. Just about everybody in our grade could a have an A average if they really put there mind into working for the better grade. This change will pull up all of those C averages into at least B averages. This will make the school look better. It will also make Houston County look better as a unit. This idea to make athletes maintain a B average is a brilliant idea. I would recommend it to every school. All athletes now are not worrying about the grades as much as there sport; they would rather be better at sports than have a B or even an A average. So it is a brilliant idea to make athletes ,like me, maintain an B average or higher. It would not only help us ,but Houston County. By helping our county it would put us at a higher ranking and help us prepare for college. So i believe this would be an awesome thing to do! J
