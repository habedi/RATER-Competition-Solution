The author supports studying Venus is worthy it even though there is some dangers to it. Venus is the Earths "Twin" it is the closest in terms of density and size. Venus is simple to see from earth, it has shown to be a challenging place to examine.

The authors first claim for studying Venus being dangerous is carbon dioxide. The author quotes in paragraph 3 saying "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus." Telling how its dangerous and how a human could die from breathing in carbon dioxide. This is important because it tells us the risks you can take if you were to get close to Venus.

The authors second claim why it is dangerous to study Venus are the clouds. He said that in paragraph 3 "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoshpere." Also telling us that venus had many dangerous features that can harm a human if they were to go to Venus. This is significant because we should know what we are getting into and know how to prevent anything harmful and study Venus without being harmed.

The last thing the author said aboout being harmful was the heat and the atmospheric pressure being way more extreme than planet earths. He said in paragraph 3 "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet. This is explaining to us how Venus is very dangerous in many ways. this is important for everyone because we should know what is around us either way whether we are learning about it or not.

The author Suggests learning about Venus not only to know it better but for us to discover new path way and to know about our surround planets. But nothing would be learned if no one takes a risk in life to study something new. Like the author claims in the last paragraph no one should be limited by dangers. Everyone can overcome and should learn soomething even if it means risking something you don't want to.
