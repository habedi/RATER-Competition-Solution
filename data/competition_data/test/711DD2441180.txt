¨The Face¨

People think that ¨The Face¨ is created by aliens,but it is actually the Face is a natural landform. So here is how I´m going to support my claim with evidence from the article.

First of all,I claim that the ¨Face¨ is just a natural landform. According to the article the scientists used the camera´s absolute maximum resolution so if there were objects in the picture they would see it. The rock formation resembles a human head,eyes,nose,and mouth, so we understand why people think it was a face created by aliens.

Second of all,According to paragraph 12 ¨what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West¨(12).If it was created by aliens it would not be hard to find because there would be more then just one.¨That´s a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars¨(12).

In conclusion,I think that the Face is a natural landform. There are evidence from the article to support my claims.¨Malin´s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera´s absolute maximum resolution¨(10).¨If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were¨(11)!
