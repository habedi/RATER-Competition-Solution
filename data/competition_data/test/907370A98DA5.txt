I think that they should have more people join/help with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I think they should have more peoople beacuse then it will incluse having more help instead of having so many animals with not so amny opeople. For example, if you had ten/10 cows and one/1 person then it would be harder . But if you had al least five/5 people helping then you would have half as many which might/would have a big effect on how much more help is nedded/wanted.

What if you put it at a diffrent point/thought. As in, what if those cows and horses were going to little kids? And they were for example going to use them for 4-H because if then would it make other people want to join? For the kids sake? Would you think that would make more people join? More people help? More people to "get involved"?

I think if we brought it to people's attention that, joining this could possibly "save an animal". If you really think about it you could even save a farm, because cows produce milk and some poeple cant even afford milk and thing that you could get from these animals that are in this program. The following problem about the farm.

And a cool part about helping would be you could go overseas if you join the program. And if you have a mind like Luke then, as qouted in this passage " I would be glad to have this opertunity. And another great benifit out of helping/joining, is as said in the story, "Table-Tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and alson games to help times to pass by.

"It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs". And if you think about it with this being quoted/said in the passage it could teach people a real lesson about others inneed of others help. So this could be

"Learning Opertunity". So this is could teach people another reason on how they arent the only ones ineed.

All these reasons are things that support my answer on how I think that they should have more pople join/help in the Seagoing Cowboys Program.
