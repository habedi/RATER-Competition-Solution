Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that if you are going to put one of these cell phone Policy's put into our school system that it should be Policy

#1.

Because, we like to have our phones to connect to the outside world. Also, what if something important is happening at home and we absolutely need to know so that we can find a way home if our parents got called into work.

Also what if there is a fight/weapon at school and nobody had there phone to call for help cause if they ran maybe it would be to late to catch who did it. Because the kid who did will say he didn't do it so you would have no proof. If a kid had his or her cell phone they could call for help. Also they could video it or take picture. This could happen when a teacher was out of the room.

So please let us keep our phones on us in case of emergency. Could we maybe just put it on silent. When kids are caught give them a detention or take it away and have a parent have to come and get it. Then we will still be following the policy, just we will have our phones on silent and not off. Then we can use them when we are not in our classes.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
