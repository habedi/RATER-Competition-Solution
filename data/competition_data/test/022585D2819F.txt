Dear Principal,

Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME. I wanted to state my position to you about community service. I think that everyone should help out in cleaning the schools because everyone is apart of making it messy, like when you are at lunch, in classrooms, outside , and even in the locker room.

While in classrooms people are eating and throwing papers and then not cleaning up there mess. If they want to dirty there classrooms that not only themselves are learning in then i think they should have to clean up the whole classroom like the kids who make a mess that make the janitors clean up. Also same with the locker rooms. I see people throwing papers , eating and then dropping the trash on the ground and just walking away. Then the P.E teachers get in trouble because they blame them for not watching the students or cleaning up.

During lunch we get the privilege to go outside to have fun and people abuse that privilege and just dump there garbage where ever they feel like it. There are perfectly good trash cans right there but they just think no one can see them. Only there friends that do it too. One time we had gotten that privilege taken away because it was a mess after our lunch. It was not fun. Everyone was confused why we got it taken away because we "never" made a mess out in the courtyard, they tried blaming it on the seventh graders. So people who are littering outside at our school should have to clean up the whole school.

In my school there is a class where it is required that you have so many hours of community service of any kind.

In conclusion, I think that if people want to trash there own school they should have to pay for it and clean up there school. OR make it a requirement in 1 main course class to have so many hours of community service for that year. That is my position i hope you take it into recommendation.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
