In this essay I will be telling you why we should explore Venus. In The Challenge of Expolring Venus there are many dangers to it but I stll think that we should try every thing in are power to explore Venus.

I think that we should still explore Venus because it would help us out in the long run becuase we the Earth become over popluation we would need some where to go so if we can inhabit different plants like Veuns it would help man kind live longer and fully explore are solar system. In paragraph 8 supports my idea becuase it states that " Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has Valus, not onlye because of the insight to be gained on the planted itself, but alos becuase of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enedeavors."

In conclusion I told you why we should try to Explore and inhabit Venus and why it is a good idea for man kind in the long run.
