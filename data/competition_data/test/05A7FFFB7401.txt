Is There Really a Face on Mars???

The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).

When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.

Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).

Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.
