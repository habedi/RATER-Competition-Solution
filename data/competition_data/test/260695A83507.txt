Imagine being driven automatically by a car to your destination? Amazing isn't it? This is why the ideal of developing fully driverless cars shouold be pushed more. These are just a few reasons on why we should work on developing this type of technology.

To begin with, wasn't this always the american dream? Generations before ours always imagined that new things like this would be developed, but they didn't have the technology. As it states in paragraph 6 we now have the ability and technolgy to do so. Why shouldn't the technology be put to better use.

Secondly, It would make things so much easier. The development of these cars could,

"change the world," as said in pargraph 1. There would be less wrecks, transportation would be faster, and there would be way less pollution. Sounds wonderful right, some people might think otherwise.

On the other hand, people might be worried about safety hazards like system malfunctions and or crashes from misreadings. Well, that's just another reaason to start development on these vehicles now. The faster peopole start developing these cars the faster the problems can be fixed. As it says in paragraph 10, "Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."

In conclusion, the development of these cars isn't all bad. Just look at all the good the production of these vehicles could do. I hope that people finally understand that the idea of developing fully driverless cars should be pushed more.
