It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA. UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for many reasons.

One reason to join is that the Seagoing Cowboys can help you learn responsibility. As mentioned in paragragh six it states, the animals had to be fed two to three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. This shows that it takes responsibility because you have to make sure you feed and clean the animal's pens regularly so they won't get sick or die.

The second reason you should join the Seaging Cowboys is because it will let you have an opportunity that you might have never gotten. As mentioned in paragraph five it states, "Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Greece and China." This shows that you can see and do things you might have never done before.

As some claim, the trip is very long and dangerous. Yes, this may be true, however table-tennis tournaments fencing, boxing, rading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a once in a life time opportunity. Along with getting to see and do things you might not have ever done to learing responsibilities there are many benefits to the Seagoing Cowboys. Join the Sea going cowboys today!
