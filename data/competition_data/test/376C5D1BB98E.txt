World war ll was hard on all of use. But with this organization is here to help you. You should really join use and help other lives that are in need of help such as humans and animals.

You should join this organization becuase you get ti travel to a lot of places and see new things. You could see the Eifell tower,go to greece,and other couintries too. Helping others is a great thing to do that makes you and the person you are helping happier. Joining UNRRA will teach you to care for others,be curtious,and to not always focuse on your self. I think that joining use willl make you happy. But there is always hard work to everything .If you love animals this would be good for you too becuase we save animals too and clean them and queck them constintly. There is also fun games such as table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittiling,and games so time will pass faster.

I think that if you jion this organization yu will become happier and less selfish. You will become a harder worker and be more kind to people. This is why you should join the UNRRA.
