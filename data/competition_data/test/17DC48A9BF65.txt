Principal,

I think that students should be required to perform community service. My friends and I agree that community service is very important. It is a good way to be a part of the local community and show your support for it.

Some students really enjoy service projects around the community. However, other students don't have as much free time as others because they are involved in other activities, such as sports or music. To solve this problem, I think only a small amount of community service should be required. This amount might be around 2 hours per semester or whatever you think best. If the students wish to perform extra community service, there might be a special prize for them (such as a certificate, trophy, or gift) or small academic exemptions since they went above and beyond the standard requirement.

Please strongly consider this suggestion. Please think of community service as a way to make our school more strongly tied in the community and more excellent.

Sincerely,
