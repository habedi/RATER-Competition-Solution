Do you believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens? Well you are incorrect, with scietific fact the face was not from aliens and was always on Mars. Man people believe that the face on mars was created by aliens because of the theroist but NASA wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars but there is no sign of one.

Scientist believe the face wwas just another Martian mesa, which was common enough around Cydonia.

Scientist also took photos called viking photos of this face in 1976, 1998, and 2001. With new high-resolution images and 3D altiemetryfrom NASA's mars global survey spacecrafts reveal the face on mars for what it really is a mesa.

People at NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars but facts show that the face was just part of the Earth's geography. For instance people believe that the aliens built the face to show they are living, but one camera team took a picture ten times sharper then the original viking photos. MAny people were waiting for the results and the results showed that it was just a natural land form and not an alien creature after all.

Not everyone was satisfied with the photos, this was because the face was located in a place where it was a cloudy time of year. people believed that under the wispy clouds they would find alien life. so on a cloudless sumer day they took another photo to show there was no sign of alien life. After taking the photo and observing it evidence showed that there was no sign of alien life.

Some of NASA would try to believe that there must be alien life on Mars but they could not find evidence to prove their point. In conclusion scientists proved that the face was just a landmark on Mars. They also proved that there is no sign of alien life on Mars.
