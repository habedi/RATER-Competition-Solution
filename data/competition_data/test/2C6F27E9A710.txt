Almost everyone who attended school can attest to how boring and tedious summer work can be. Whether it's assigned reading or a project, students often dislike having schoolwork cut into their summertime. However, it is a necessary evil, and although there are compelling arguments for self-directed learning and independent study, the fact remains that it's the teacher's job to know how to help their students learn. Summer work should be designed via a partnership of students and teachers, so that students can learn in ways that interest them and help them grow, and teachers can ensure that the material is taught correctly.

While the intervention of teachers in this process may seem to be too controlling or unnecessary, the fact remains that they have gone through a lengthy process to ensure that they are trained to teach the material as effectively as possible. They go through an extensive process involving obtaining at least a bachelor's degree as an undergraduate student (and in many cases going even further and pursuing post-graduate studies), spending time as a student teacher, obtaining other certifications, and taking part in continuing teacher training throughout their careers. The experience and education that teachers have is simply too much to ignore when considering the development of a student's summer project or curriculum.

Another factor to consider when advocating for students developing their own projects or curriculum is that all students are different. Some may not design their own work with their own best educational interests in mind, and others may not do as well learning via a highly structured summer project or curriculum. Yes, some students are very bright or passionate and will diligently undertake projects and studies on their own, but that is not true for all students. Everyone learns differently, and many people thrive in situations where they have specific guidelines and rules to follow or goals to meet. The wide range of learning and personality types in schools is a major reason why summer projects and curricula should be a collaborative effort between students and teachers. No two students learn the same, so why should they be forced to do the same work?

Although there are many good reasons for students doing projects that were designed by a teacher, it is also important to consider the fact that teachers may simply be out of touch with how their students wish to learn. Student-designed work can be incredibly fulfilling upon completion; the student will have identified an area of study they enjoy, pursued and researched it, and hopefully will have reached a fulfilling conclusion through a project, experiment, or assignment. However, all of this can be accomplished to its fullest potential with the help of an adult. A trusted mentor (such as a teacher), can be an invaluable resource to a young person undertaking a major project on their own.

Much of education deals with absolutes. Standardized testing, graduation requirements, etc., etc. One can go on and on describing all of the things that individuals must do to conform with the school system. All of this is necessary to ensure that all students find success. However, summer work is a wonderful opportunity for a student's individuality to shine through, and with the help of a teacher, they can design work that will be fulfilling and extremely educational.
