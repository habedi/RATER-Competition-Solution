Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that if you try to stop students from playing sports because they have a C or lower is ridiculous. Because besides being at school to see their friends, sports are the only thing that have to look forward to in school. And if you keep students from playing sports because of their grades then there will be some very angry students and parents. And i don't think you want the other parents talking bad about you or the school.

And the student who don't play sports have other things in school that they like and that will effect them to.

And most students can't grasp the concept like others and just because of that reason they won't be able to play the sports they want to. many students love playing basketball, football, and baseball and other activities . And many of those students who do love those sports can't keep a B average in some subjects. Because when students start playing their favorite sport they don't think about school work they think about winning the game. and students who are doing their favorite activitie

Because if you keep students from playing their favorite sport or activity they will not only get even worse in school their attitude will change completely. Some students won't even consider doing school, because you got rid of their favorite sport.

And to take that away from them because of grades is completely redundant. This is the reason why i think that if you keep students from playing their favorite sport because of the grade average is ridiculous.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
