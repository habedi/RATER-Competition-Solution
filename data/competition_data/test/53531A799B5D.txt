A lot of accidents and misfortunes can happen without expecting it. Kids and teens can catch a sickness and have to be confined to a bed for months, being unable to move. Once they recover, they'll realize that they've missed a whole month of school, missing a heap of work and a couple of tests. They'll feel dreaded from thinking of all of the work that they'll have to catch up on. These students would be able to catch up with their classmate easier if they were able to do their work at home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students will able to catch up with work while sick or injured and can work at their own pace.

Students will have the ability to attempt to catch up if they're sick or injured to the point where they can't even try to walk properly. Any student who happened to be in a car accident for example, they'll still be able to manage their way to get some of their work out. Having a pile of homework and classwork to do is not easy from the perspective of a child that's trying to recover from a disease pr injury, maybe even surgery. Any accident has a possibility of happening and there;s no real way of changing if it can or can't happen. Students shouldn't have to worry about the amount of work they have to do because they were out of school, but should only worry about their recovery.

Students can work the amount of work that needs to be done at their own pace. Some kids work faster than others and are told to slow down. Some kids work slower than others and are told to speed up. Being able to work at home will remove these pressures off of them and let them work how fast they are willing to work. This help students by not feeling rushed to do what needs to be done, letting the same students to not have to guess on questions they have to think or work out. Instead they could just study a little bit, go back to the question, and then continue to finish up any problems they had without having to be concerned about the speed of their work.

Some people may argue that being able to attend classes at home would make student lazy or that it would defeat the purpose of school. Or that some kids may act sick just so that they could stay at home. These reasons or understandable, but the students who are in need of attending classes at home should be given that necessity. Only the students who can't come to school for any reason should be able to take their classes at home or where they are. It's better this way so that when the student comes back to their school, they aren't forced to do a pound of work that's due in a week. It's simply more effective this way than not letting students do their work at home.

In conclusion, being able to attend classes at home would be a benefit to some kids. Students could work at home if they are sick or injured and they won't need to be in any type of rush to do their missing work. Though they are thought to be some downsides, the pros easily out wight the cons. Students need to be able to do their work on their time so that when they go back to school, they won't have to worry about the amount of work that's missing. Rather, they'll have to worry about what;s being taught in their respective classes. Letting kids, teens, and adults do their school work at home could help them majorly in the long run.
