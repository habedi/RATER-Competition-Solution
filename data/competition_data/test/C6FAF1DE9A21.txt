Having technology that can read your emotion it's okay and it can help people that don't have friends or don't have any body to talk to. If you need someone to talk to but you don't have anybody, than technology can help you with that problem. If the technology/computer can see your emotion than it can tell what's wrong with you and give you some answer's to you're problems in life. In the same time you should be carefull, because technology can maybe turn back on you and will want you to do something bad that never crossed your mind. If tecchnology is able to read your emotions it's okay but we should also be careful. In the same time that type of technology that is able to read your emotion it's amazing but power full too; because if you are trying to hide something from it, it can tell that you are lying to the computer and also that tecchnology can take peoples jobs. People in the world need their jobs for they can take care of the family.
