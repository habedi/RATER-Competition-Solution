Dear Principal,

I believe that yes cell phones can be distracting, and take away from learning time, but look at the advantages what if you are in a bad situation, and need to call for help, or maybe just need a ride you cant call into the wind for that . Cell phones provide advantages for the user. even then calling in class shouldn't be allowed reasons to believe it just really distracts students, and if you do come to a compromise cell phones should at least be turned off during school classes but still i do not see at that point of view that the providing of more disadvantages will stop.

So yes I believe that students should b e allowed cell phones just not on every bases for example. Shouldn't use them during main classes like math science, and so on nor should they use them during passing time really consumes most of it, and prevents them from getting to class on time. See as it may that will be a problem, but for the most part lunch is really not a very bad time to pull out the cell phone, because it is not taking out of there class time they are probably not causing trouble, and not annoying others, but that also means that if seen texting in class or making a call it is necessary to take it away.

In those reasons, and beliefs that i offer, and share with you i believe that you will see that some of these advantages will be good. Disadvantages not as much but hopefully you see it though a different point of view.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
