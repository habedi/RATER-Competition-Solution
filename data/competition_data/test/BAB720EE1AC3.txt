Have you ever had to do something you really didn't want to do? Well, I really don't like or want to do any extracurricular activities. At some schools extracurricular activities are a requirement and all student have to be in one. I disagree with the decision to make all students participate in an extracurricular activity because some people don't have time for them, family is important and an extracurricular can get in the way of it, and sometimes people just don't make the cut.

My older sister does sports. She rushes to practice after school, rushes home to get dinner, then she has to do all of her homework, and by the time she's finished with all of that it's nearly midnight. Some people just don't have time for an extracurricular. Teenagers are supposed to get around 9-10 hours of sleep, but people who play sports, or participate in activities that require them to stay at school for extra time, probably don't get more than 6-7 hours. Other people also might have other commitments that they have to do instead of an extracurricular. Do the people who don't have time participate fail?

Not only do students have tight time schedules with an extracurricular, so do their parents. My dad wakes up at five o'clock in the morning to get to work on time at seven o'clock, my mom wakes up at six thirty to take me and my sister to school. My parents don't get home until five or six o'clock most days, and that's after one of them gets my sister after her practice is finished. We don't eat dinner together often, but we should. Family is important but are the required extracurriculars more important?

I wonder, what happens to the kids who don't make the cut? Do they fail like the kids who don't have time, or the kids who choose family over an extracurricular activity? Sometimes when people tryout for a play or a sport they don't get in. Although there might be other clubs for those students, some clubs have certain requirements. For example, student council requires that you are chosen to be a part of the group. Another example is a club that might only be for a certain gender, or for a certain age group. Then these kids that don't have an extracurricular might start to stress about what will happen. they will worry if they'll fail or get a bad grade.

Required extracurricular activities are a bad idea. They can interfere with peoples lives and cause many problems. To participate in an extracurricular should be a students choice not a requirement.
