Dear Principle,

If I were you I would let any student play because it is not fare for them. As long as they have the school spirit to play then it is good. If a student is not doing good at their classes then they can't play sports until they have raised their grade up.

Having sports is a good thing because it helps students how to learn and play. It doesn't matter if your good or not as long as you have the ability to play and learn. My reasons for sports to the principle is that it is not fare for other students because usually some students grade don't go to a B only to a C. It is important to know that you have to make things fare for other students. Students love to play sports because it is important to let your body be healthy. Doing sports is something that school usually have to have fun.

Sport is some kind of fun that students gather together to get to know each other. If the principle changed it then why wouldn't we have sports? If the principle changed it then we wouldn't get to know each other and learn how to play. Gathering students together helps make the school have more school spirit. For me I don't think the principle shouldn't change it because it is better as it is.
