Schools have been providing online classes for students very recently. The number of students attending schools have risen up because of this feature. Individuals are able to be present and learning wherever they may be during an online course. Students will greatly benefit from taking online courses because they are able to stay in a comfortable environment, have a greater number of resources, and they are able to learn at their own pace.

Home is where comfort lies within learning. Being able to learn in a comfortable environment is what a lot of sessions at a school lack. School is supposed to be mainly about learning, but most people find it extremely difficult to focus because of the others around them. Home is a place where no one will judge one another or have to worry about anything other than the task at hand. Some people say that working at home is not a great place because of the distractions of electronics. In regards to that, people are able set those electronics away from them or give them to their guardians to help them focus entirely. It allows for a reward at the end of their studies to be present for motivation to continue to work as well. I was given the opportunity to be able to take an online lesson in high school for Pre-Calculus. I was able to have less distractions from being around others during this time, This allowed for greater results on the quiz later in the quarter.

Backpacks are not able to carry everything a student might need for all of their classes. This is why students have to pick and choose what can go with them and what can't. By taking online classes, students are able to have their desired resources right by them. I was able to use all my materials that I possessed when learning online. Materials, such as textbooks and notebooks that I was not able to keep in my bag, were able to grant a greater understanding of the lesson. For an essay, I knew there was an instance of that prompt in an old book I read, but

I did not have that book with me to be able to do that part during class time. This caused for a invaluable use of time during the class because I was not able to use everything I would've been able to if I were taking an online course.

School teachers tend to go at the pace of the class' average. Everyone doesn't have the same learning speed, so most people need more or less time to master the topic that was given. Online classes give you the ability of spending as much time needed for each of the topics by watching the lesson over again. My younger brother takes online lessons since he is faster at learning topics online than in class. It allows for him to spend less time learning the same things he already understands online, while asking about new things during class time.

Online courses are beneficial for students because of the familiar working space, they'll have plenty of materials available to them, and their personal learning pace is able to be utilized. Working in a comfortable, familiar environment allows for a student to stay focused on what they need to accomplish. By having all the materials students might need for an assignment, their quality of learning and work tend to rise. Pacing is extremely important for one's understanding of a topic as a whole. Courses that are given online are very useful in a mastery of a subject overall.
