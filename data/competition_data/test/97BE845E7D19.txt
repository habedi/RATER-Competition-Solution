Dear Principal,

I think that having cell phones is great, and being able to use them in school would be even greater. I also think your choices are great choices, but you always have those trouble makers who try to bring their phones into class with them. I think that using your phones during free periods and lunch periods is a great idea ,but did you think that some kids might text each other what answers they put on the test that not everybody has finished, including your friend that you are texting? I think that we should be able to have cell phones in school, but have them in your locker. You should be able to use them in the morning and after school, but once that bell rings they should be in your locker. I think that the second policy might be the best policy to go with. Although I think policy one would great, policy two is the more logical choice. I think though you should change it so that we could have them at special occasions, such as if there is a special musical or funny guest, if we have a pep rally or anything that is something like that, or if we have a free day to do anything(like the last day of school or if a lot of people are gone for something). If cell phones aren't allowed in school I would be a little upset but I wouldn't be heart-broken. School is a place for learning, but it is also a place to interact. We see our friends at school so why would we need to text them. To see what our assignment is in language? I think we can all wait the five or ten minutes where we wait for the bus or our ride until we can text our friend we just say less than five minutes ago.

I think that the choices you have are great, but if we could only have one I would pick the second policy. I think that the first policy gives us too much free will. Even though having free will is a good thing, having too much might not be such a good thing. After all you are the principal and have the last say, but I hope you take into considerate what I have written for you. I hope it will make picking the right choice even easier for you.

I know you will pick the best policy. Thank you for reading this. Have a great day.
