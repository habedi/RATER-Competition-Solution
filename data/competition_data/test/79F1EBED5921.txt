Most schools don't make their students participate in after school activities, but mine dose.

I don't agree with the choice and hears why.

Students have to sit at school and behave for eight hours a day. So when its time to finally time to go home and spend time with family and relax were excited. When you make us do extracurricular actives we don't get that time at home to relax and spend time with are family. I think we sometimes forget that everyone needs there own personal time to them self.

Although thats a big part of why I disagree with my principal I still have more to say. Some students may not have a ride to these extracurricular actives or a ride to get back home. Which could bring stress to the students parents. I may not be a parent myself but I know being a parent can be very stressful. Many parents work late night shifts. In which they can't be there to pick up their son or daughter.

My third and most important reason is that kids should be kids. We deserve to go outside and play and play video games. We deserve a childhood not being a miniature adult with lots extra tasks to do and think about. We need this time now to grow and be kid because in the real world they're a much bigger consequent then being grounded. Theses extracurricular activities are taking up all our time and a lot of us don't even like the activity we have.

All in all, we should'nt be forced to do something we don't want to. It should be optional to join a extracurricular activity. I just wish my principal would have looked at his chose from different points of view.
