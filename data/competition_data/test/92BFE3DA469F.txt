Dear Principal,

My letter to you today should make you think twice about cell phones in our school. In my own opinion I think we should have the cell phones in our school and I also think keeping it in our lockers isn't right. I do not think it's right only because if we kept our cell phones in our lockers what if there were to be a fire you would have to give out the money or even give new cell phones to the children of the school. I think many students would agree with that also. So I think it would be a lot better to have them and carry them around then to keep them in our lockers. Plus, if we carried them around children would want to come to school because they would want to text and things like that because you know how the children are not getting up for school . But having the cell phone would want them to come to school and if we used our cell phones at lunch and in our spare time a lot more children would have there work done and not blow it off like most students do. That's why i think we should have cell phones here in our school only because children would have there work done and would want to get there work done so they could text. Having the cell phones would be like a reward to them. The children would love it! Also less and less children would get in trouble for having there cell phones in there pockets or they wouldn't get in trouble as much for texting. That Means you would have less cell phones and less parents in your office to pick up the cell phones up.

Sincerely Your Student,
