Dear principal,

I think your both your policy's are good but I don't think that you can get every one to not even bring their phones to school. I only think that because some students will bring their phones on accident and then get it taken away. Then i f the students get their phones taken away then their parents wont be happy then you will have angry parents coming to the school to pick up a phone. I don't think that people in the deans office like to deal with unhappy people. So I personally think that not allowing students to have their phones at school is a good idea.

I think it would be better that you allow student to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off during class time. I think that it would be better because you don't have as many complaints about how you say they aren't allowed to have their phones. student rather carry their phones even though they are off rather than not being able to carry them.

So that is what I think would be a good idea for you to think about. I really hope that you think about what i had to say about your policy one and two.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
