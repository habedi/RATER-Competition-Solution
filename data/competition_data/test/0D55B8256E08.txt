Just like Luke, you can participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program for free!

What does this program do, you might ask? Well we're here to tell you just what it is, and why you should join it!

We're part of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaion Administration," or in shorter terms, the UNRRA.

We have worked together to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. All together we are 44 nations. But helping others isn't the only benefit, you get to see sights you've never seen before.

Everyone has the benefit of seeing atleast one country. Last year, our group had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. They also got to ride the gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Our group also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on their way to China.

There isn't only helping people and seeing sites, you actually get to travel the high seas. However, this might be the hardest part. The groups were always busy and it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. The part that had to be the most challenging for some members were caring for the animals during the crossings.

There are also fun times on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Usually we play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals are housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure for some people. For most of our groups, it opened up the world to them. They stated that they were "grateful for the opporunity, and that it made them more aware of people of ther countries and their needs."

In conclusion, that is why you should join our Seagoing Cowboys program. Thank you for listening, and we hope to see you in the future!
