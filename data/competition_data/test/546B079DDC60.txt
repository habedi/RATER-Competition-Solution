Online classes are the new educational advancement for millions of aspiring students to succeed. In the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the population of both primary schools and colleges/universities, which has caused many school campuses to become overcrowded quickly. However, their are many other issues that students attending these schools continue to face such as not being able to attend school or less interaction with their teacher. The issue is extremely complex and challenging for all of those who encounter it, but the solution for this requires an innovative method; online education/classes. Students would benefit from taking online classes at home because students would be provided with a more comfortable environment, receive help from teachers more easily, and students who suffer from sicknesses or disabilities have an better way to obtain their education.

Attending an online class is beneficial for most, if not all, students because the students are able to learn in a more familiar environment that provides less distractions. The students taking the online class are less likely to become distracted during the class because the other students are not visible because only the teacher and lecture are presented on the screen. This offers students a better chance of retaining information while attending an online class. Mean while, an on campus class offers a less likelihood of students being able to retain important information. Although, social interaction may be altered due to classes taken at home, students will have the chance to interactively learn using a different form of education. Taking an online class would also provide more safety for a student both emotionally and mentally due to a significantly less chance of an active threat or physical bullying. With an increase of active threats, such as "school shooters", many students may prefer taking a class at home rather than at school. Overall, the utilization of online classes would drastically increase a student's performance to retain or learn information, while providing a more comfortable environment than on campus education.

Classes taken from home would benefit both the teachers and the students simultaneously. Across the United States hundreds of thousands of students need help from teachers whether it be homework or a misunderstanding on a subject. The ability to take an online class provides a better chance for a teacher to respond to multiple students questions at a given time. For example, the professors teaching the online class may establish a video conference where students may ask questions or for help. This is an extremely useful method that could benefit those who take an online class more than those taking an on campus class. Another reason of why this method would be successful is because thousands of schools across the country including Generic_School utilize this tactic. Studies show that learning in an environment where hundreds of questions can be asked on the information presented, at any given time, will help foster a better understanding of the information for the student. Furthermore, the usage of video conferencing/ online classes, that are taught by teachers, will benefit students due to a more accessible option of asking questions and receiving help.

Millions of students around the world are sick every week and are often challenged with the work they miss. The best use of online classes is clearly seen by those who are sick or those who suffer from disabilities because their access to on campus classes may be impaired. Students who are sick often stay home from school, however their are a few exceptions of students who do not whether those students have a test that day or other activities. By creating online classes for students the spread of sicknesses among not only student, but all types of people can be averted. The online class system could also be used to help those who are handicapped or disabled learn in a less challenging environment. An example of this is students who are in wheel chairs because when a class switches to another the students may have difficulties reaching their next class. By utilizing video conferences with teachers at home this issue could be solved easily. In conclusion, the implementation of online classes to students would allow the disabled and those who are sick still attend classes.

Students taking online classes would benefit from it many different ways depending on the circumstances. The utilization of these classes will create the future of education in the United States and the world. Examples of why these implementations work are scattered throughout the American school system. Overall, the utilization of online classes/ video conferences would benefit those who are sick or disabled, those who do not feel comfortable or have difficulties learning at school, and would allow more students to receive help from teachers, while lowering the work load for teachers.
