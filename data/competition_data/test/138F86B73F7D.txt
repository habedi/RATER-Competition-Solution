Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during there break. I think that they should be student-designed because if the schools want the students to do work on there summer break then it should be something they want to learn. Some people might think that they should be designed by teachers to maximize the stuff they can learn. Also If the students design the projects they will have more fun doing them because its something they chose.

I think that if students design there own summer projects they are something they want to do and not what the teachers want them to do. For example if a teacher designs the project then It would be like another day of school and i dont think the students want to do school during there summer break. They would prefer relaxing and not having to do work for 3 months. Also if the students design it then it will be something they like to do. For example having games or something similar to help them learn. Also if its something the students designed and wanted to do It would be more likely to get done and It wouldntÂ be a waste of time.

Another example why students should assign there own summer projects is that it would be more fun. For example like including math in one of there games. Or having a coloring sheet that helps them with addition or subtraction. Another reason why students should design there own projects is that they would most likely get it done because there having fun with it.

Other people might say that teachers should design the projects because it would maximize the amount of stuff included. For example a student might include easy subjects in there project but teachers could put everything they learned and put it in one project. also if students design it they might get stuff wrong if they dont know it.

In conclusion students should design their own projects because if schools want students to do work on their summer break then t should be something they want to do. Also it should be something fun that they'll want to do and finally some people might say that teachers should design the projects to maximize the amt of stuff included.
