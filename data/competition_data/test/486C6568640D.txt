Our school normally has every student do a project during the summer to keep us learning and its normally designed by teachers but, this year they asked all the students in quick little 1 answer survey the question stated was "should students or teacher design students summer projects", so as I thought about it and I realized to myself that even though normally teacher make the project and i agree that they would give us more informed information and standardized questions that are on topic with the information we should learned but I feel as tho less students complete them and have less of a connection to the work and since it being summer more work would make more students procrastinate more to actually complete the work but on the other hand I truly believe agree that summer projects would be accomplished more if it was by student design and students would be more connected to the work and take way less time trying to finish there summer projects.

students during summer tend have a lot of free time except for those who tend to take up summer jobs or camps and are less focus on other things and tend to mainly focus on work during summer and tend not have time to do a large teacher design summer project packet but, it would be easier for those to make there project because design by them and they would focus more something they create would be way will to finish something they design then some work just given to them by a teacher during summer.

when teachers generally design a summer project to help keeps learning they tend make sure its at least enough knowledge and work to keep u busy for month and so u can keep gaining knowledge and when students continue to gain knowledge that means there would less need reteaching students previously learned knowledge and which would make students even smarter then where before.

most time when a summer project is teacher design there way more work to do lot tend question and answer projects packets that tend to be really thick with work normally they will be like a 1,000 page packet with 800 questions and answer with key information coming be for the questions that have read through then answer questions which most find not entertaining and like extra and tend to seriously not do the work because its so much work for them accomplish and they rather do other things with there summer.

when project are normally student design they are normally a creative project you have make and design using the given topic a students are free to show what they actually know and are more connected to the work because they get to set up there project and can have much information as students need or want and help to have little more fun while gaining knowledge.

in conclusion I believe even though teacher design project contain a lot of work and knowledge but tend to be excessive in the questions and required work and furthermore student design projects are better for summer project easier to do most students complete them at a faster rate and over all it shows more what the students learned.
