Was the "face" on Mars created by aliens? So people have a theory that a picture of a human looking "face" on Mars was created by aliens, and others believe that it's just a natural landform. The "face" is just a natural landformation, and scientist haven't discovered aliens. Aliens couldn't have created the "face" because scientific evidence doesn't prove they actually exict.

The "face" is just a natural rock formation with the illision of eyes, nose, and a mouth."A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"(NASA 3) Also, a shadow could have been casted across that area."Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." (NASA 2) Hence, it only being a rock formation in Mars.

Although many people want it to be created by aliens scientist don't have any scientific evidence and few believe it was created by aliens."Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact..."(NASA 6)

" The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." (NASA 5) Only so that the NASA funders could get money and that the "face" was only just well-known and popularly talked about because it looks like a human face. Therefore, scientist don't have explanation of how aliens could have created the land formation.

The "face" on Mars some people may say that it was created by aliens; however, it's just a natural land formation. It is just a formation in on Mars that looks like a human face. That people wish it was created by aliens, but scientist haven't discovered aliens yet for them to have evidence that aliens could have made the "face."

In conclusion, aliens couldn't have created the "face" because they haven't been discovered by scientist. The rock formation formed as a human face is only a natural land formation in Mars. Most likely only a Martian mesa with unusual shadows. It could be a possibilty be that aliens did create it if scientist later discover aliens.
