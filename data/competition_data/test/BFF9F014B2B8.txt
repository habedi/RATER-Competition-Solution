There are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. These advantages aren't just for the environment's safety, but your safety as well. These advantages include less problems with our environment, and with our society.

When it comes to greenhouse gasses, remember that there is carbon monoxide, which is a greenhouse gas, coming out from the tailpipe of the cars. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, they make up to 50 percent of greenhouse gasses that polute. It is important to reduce the amount of gasses that enter the air through cars, so limiting car usage would help to limit the amount of gasses that have entered the atmosphere.

Another problem that is issued with car usage is traffic safety. There have been many car accidents and crashes in the United States, as well as many other areas in the world. It would be safer if people walked, biked, hiked, skated, or even took buses to places that they would need to go. Limiting car usage would also greatly reduce the number of accidents. It would also lower stress as well for people who are easily tense and stressed. If you are riding a bike or walking, you don't necessarily want to hear the sound of motors and engines. If they limit the amount of car usage, there would be less tension and more relaxation to those who would chose not to use a car. Also, riding bikes, walking, skating, or hiking can be a great workout for outdoorsmen who want to do something active, instead of sitting in the car getting from point A to point B.

Limiting the number of cars, or the ammount of times that we spend in our vehicles daily would cause great improvements in the economy and society. This could help preserve the environment and the safety of people as well. It all comes down to less car usage and spending more time walking, or even doing excercise.
