Attend classes from home is a good idea, it is a new way to teach, the online classes grand students and different people around the world a new way to learn in a different environment, is a great benefit for some student who living far away from school, because taking online classes is a different way to expanse and show up news skills.

Some students development news skills when they're working in computers, also this way to take online classes, take less time to finished some classes, to evaluate this concept teachers the are using the same role, as same rules and the same ways as attend to a regular schools.

But there is big differences between attend to regular classes and take online classes, for example, in online classes you are seen you teacher by a computer and the rest of the class in the same way, would became boring or stressing, but it is a short way to finish some classes.

Attended to regular school is another way that many students decide to choose, because is more fun, they meet new students, and they reach news goals, but in the same way would became stresing because they got more classes in the day.

To specify this way that schools are putting in work, it's a good way to reach and finished more quickly ours goals, in my position I will be able to attend classes from home., it will be more easy for me to finished on time all my classes.

In conclusion schools that are doing this are finding a new way to expanse education to new places where schools are far away for students houses.
