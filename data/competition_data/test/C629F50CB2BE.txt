TEACHER_NAME;

I heard you were going to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I disagree with that because, most students in our school have a grade C average. I know that if you probably made the average higher to a grade B average then it would bribe students to do their homework and pay attention more in school and then, they would work harder academically if they wanted to stay on their sports team (i. e. volleyball, basketball, Lacrosse, football, etc.).

Since most students only have a grade C average, there wouldn't be very many students trying out or participating in school sports because they would be unable too.

If you want us to win, and have a trophy case filled with 1st place ribbons and trophies then, you should let the school policy stay where it is; at a grade C average. Most students that do well academically, most of the time aren't good in sports because, they may not have time to practice their sports. Also, most students that are poor in academics, they are good in sports because they have the time to practice, get outside, be active and exercise more too. So for the students are good in sports but poor in academics you should keep it to a grade C average, because kids need a an outlet to go to, have fun and get their mind off of things. I hope this helped you think about your decision.

Sincerely,

Student
