Dear Principal,

Students should do community service. They should because, it would really help our environment. If students would take an hour out of their time to volunteer to clean up the beaches in the summer, tutor kids, volunteer and a homeless shelter, or just anything to help people in need or the environment. It would really be helpful and it would save the planet and people. People are sometimes just to lazy to do something like this. Otherwise, they make up excuses like "I have to much homework". People that don't really have time because they have a religion group they go to, or just because they have church or something. Most churches have a volunteer group you could do. Or else the church as a whole does something community service like.

Some people believe that they shouldn't do community service because it take up to much time. People sit at home with their TV's on all day, everyday. They will sit at home playing video games or on the computer. What they don't know is that, that is really hurting our environment right now. People are cutting trees down everyday. Trees give off oxygen and without oxygen we wouldn't be here. Go out and plant a tree. That would help our environment a whole lot. Even if you just plant some flowers that would still help.

Taking community service isn't just a punishment, its fun for some people. Some people like to save the plant. Some people like to help other people. I know that i would like to help other people. But i don't get the opportunity to do community service, because i play a lot of sports. But yes, I do have a lot of free time and i wish i could do community service. Community service isn't just about helping the environment and helping people. It's also about meeting new people. When you meet new people that can sometimes change your actions. And changing your actions into doing community service, is a good thing.

I agree with having students do community service 100%. I think that it would be a good thing to do to help our planet, to help people in need, and also to help your self.
