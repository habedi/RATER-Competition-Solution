There are some advantages without having cars to drive as seen in a suburb in German. This car free suburb has band the use of cars it is illegal to drive a car if you live in the suburb. it is a car free place although if you by a car you have to buy a special spot in a garage and spend upwards up to 40,000 dollars for a spot. People actually move to this suburb for the relief of driving a car because of the stress that goes into everyday driving. This suburb is living "smart" they have developed a new way to live this suburb is fitted with stores so you can still get all your groceries, clouths, etc. Living here it would be easiest to puchase a bicycle in order to get around in a faster way outher then walking. Here in this suburb over 70 percent of Vaubans families dont not own cars and 57 percent sold a to move here.

The car freesubhurb has slowly grown and its still growing everyday IN Vauban there are over 5,500 residents who live there within a rectangular square mile. STores are placed a walk away on a mainstreet rather down a road on a highway. Although the area in small enough to walk through the advanteges for shopping is great your not far from home and you can still take a bicycle to get around. The exhuast level in the air has decreased dramaticly in this suburb more and more places want to start this new way of living but outher people may not like living so close to eachouther some people like there privacy out and away from outhers.

Paris has band driving due to all the smog produced by all the cars. In paris driving you will be fined almost 4,000 people were fined for driving there cars. If paris resorts to the "smart" way of living as in Vauban German the smog levels would decrease raoidly if they banned cars.Â  Ome cities are even trying to band public transportation because of all the the smog. Thats a valad point if you were to band cars youd have to ban outher transportations like buses, cabs, etc. If the new style of living hits the united states my choice of transportation will be a horse just like the old days.
