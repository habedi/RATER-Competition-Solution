"Success is not shown for just doing one thing, it's shown for doing multiple things." -Taylor Swift once said. To further more illustrate, Students love playing sports or playing with the chess club at school. Students get to have fun out of school while still being on school grounds. For this reason, Students should be able to complete one extracurricular activity because it can lead to a new friendship, students have lots of fun, and it keeps you active.

To begin with, Completing one activity could lead to new friendship. For example, My friend had just made the soccer team and had no clue who any of his teammates were. There was another student who had made the team who wasn't familiar with his teammates, so my friend and him became best friends. Another example is, When doing the yearbook the two girls fought to see who could get the best pictures so they can be announced best photographer, when one of the girl's trampled over a crowd of football players and broke her camera. The other girl stopped what she was doing to come help her, yet knowing she was always mean to her and showed no respect. Because of this, Friendship can occur when you least expect it in tough times. There is always someone out there that just wants to be your friend. New friends lead to more fun.

Secondly, Students have most fun when they can be themselves. To illustrate, When playing your favorite sport, or doing your after school activity. You get to run, play, talk, and be free. All things you only can do every once in a while in school. Most of all you can be your self. To further show, Signing up to do Chess club, Art club, and Robotics are all fun and interesting things to do after school. One robotics team got to go kings dominion because there tournament was so close. As a result, Having fun is the most precious things you can have while being a student. You can be free with knowing theres no limits to having fun and being active.

Finally, Being active while being a student is healthy. To show, Scientist have found that 3/4 of the student population is not being active. Students have not been productive after school hours, so the school boards have gotten together, and decided to have after school activities to keep students healthy and productive after school. Additionally, Students can choose there activity to complete or try out for a sport. This way it's better to keep the students more engaged with the school, yet keep them active. Therefor, keeping students in a chair for six hours is not always gonna keep the students energetic for the whole entire day.

In conclusion,"Don't expect someones success to come to you, follow your own path to success" -Nike. To further explain, Students can take what class they like. Most students take classes there friends take, but never understood why they took that class when there not good at it. Same as an extracurricular activity. Students can take what ever activity they want for their reasons. Students should agree with having to take one extracurricular class because, it leads to new friendships, students have lots of fun, and it keeps them active. Instead of students being bored all day. They can take one activity of their choosing, while having fun, and being social with other kids.
