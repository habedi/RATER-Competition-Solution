Cars, though useful, have negitive impacts on the world. These effects can be seen from high density urban areas, and around the globe with gobal warming. Smog, greenhouse gasses, and stress are some of the main outputs from cars; they are a useful but dangerous tool.

Smog in urban areas are a global concern, causeing many cities to try to reduce the smog by putting restrictions on cars. It may be the ban of plates with even or odd numbers on certin days, or the ban of cars all together. The effect is staggering; citeis are becomeing more and more clean. Even America, the world leader in automobiles, is showing some want to reduce car transmitions in their cities. In some cities smog is a crippling thing. "[the smog] riavaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." in Paris this was the case, and after banning cars on certin days, the smog began to clear up.

Greenhouse gasses are causing temeratures to become more extreme. Reduceing cars can help save dying ecosystems or dwindiling numbers of certin animals. Car free days in places like Bogota help reduce greenhosue gas, and it shows. people are driving less and less so "many socioiologist beleive ... [ people driving less ] will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment"

Stress caused by cars is just as big as a problem as smog and pollution. People who switch to cities that are designed to not use cars say that they have reduced stress compared to when they had cars. "When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way." says a member of Vauban, a city desined with no cars in mind.

With all of this information wse might be able to help fix the world, by reducing the cause of the problem. Smog stress and Greenhouse gasses are on the decline thanks to less and less people driving.
