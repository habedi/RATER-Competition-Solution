NASA has found a face in Mars. Many say its just natural, but others say its from aliens. A few reasons people say it was created by aliens is its in an odd place, and it has unusal shadows.

One reason that people say aliens created this face on Mars is because where the face is located on Mars is a particularly odd spot. In paragraph 8 it says "The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 a cloudy time of year on the Red planet." Also in paragraph 9 it says "It's not easy to target Cydonia," says Gavin. "In fact, it's hard work." Mars Global Surveyor is mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km wide stripes."

Another reason is it has unsual shadows for example in paragraph 1 it says "When (the Viking spacecraft) it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red planet.
