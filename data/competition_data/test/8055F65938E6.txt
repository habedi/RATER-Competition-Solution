Technology has evolved in many ways over the years. Yes, this technology may be very good for our expanding environment yet do we really know the real cost technology may bring us? Does auto-driving cars seem right when there`s everyday hazardous drivers out in the world?

In my perspective I`ve already seen on news, on the internet and in my own eyes cars and automobiles get torn up or pummeled together just because they forgot a turn or they didn`t stop at the right time. These cars may have innovated warning signals to alert the driver but what would happen if the warning was to late? Would we lose lives and supply that cars/trucks may be bringing? I rather have the least outdated technology then suffer a live and food or clothing that could`ve helped me and others.

The cost of making cars that self drive may just be hundreds of dollars just to make a specific part thats needed in the vehicle. Maybe all together. But the real cost is those that may suffer injurys of a unexpected accident. They probably just lost themselves money that couldve been better spent. Perhaps other people may not mind that they lost a valuable car and can throw money like its nothing. But they don`t know the impact it has on themselves and others.

If anything were to happen who will the law punish? Those that were in the car or those that it exist in the first place? It has already been declared that their are some states that banned any self-driving cars. I as a single person respect that. But, is it enough to let more states and cities still trying to invent/improve cars that can auto-drive?

If its woth getting in accidents, losing money and maybe even losinga whole business then lets hope the new and improved self-drive car can make it into the future. In other words disaster is soon to come and I never would have thought that technology was meant to hurt others.
