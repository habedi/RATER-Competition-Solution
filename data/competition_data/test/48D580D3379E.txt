so the question is, should we allow students at school to have cell phones. in my complete and honest opinion, i think it is a great idea. cell phones are a wonderful way to talk to friends during lunch without having to walk across the lunch room. they can also provide as a good resource for kids during free time that need help with assignments, seeing that most phones have wi-fi connect ability. and even if they cant connect with the internet, you could just text a good friend of yours. another good reason to have the phone is so when a student isn't feeling well, the teacher could give the child permission to text his or her mom/dad to bring them some medicine or to go home. on thing that we need to realize is that we are growing as a country culturally as well as technologically. as a school and a country we need to embraces technology. it is estimated that by 2015 all schools will have switched over to e-readers. if technology is moving that fast, why not go with the flow of things and allow thing like cell phones at school. all in all, i think that it would be a great idea to let children have cellular devices at school, it would be a time saving effort for not only the students but the teachers as well. this is why i think we should adopt policy 1.
