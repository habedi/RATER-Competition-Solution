In the text ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' There is a face, not just any face but a face that is formed over time into Mars. Some people may say that the face was created by aliens over time that lived on Mars, but their is no real proof that the face was created by one.

In 1976, there was barely anything to be classified that their was even a face, even though it was forming by 1998. Three years later you can see a face clearly on Mars. Seems weird? Not really because it was later then noted a ''huge rock formation.'' The face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian a latitude where it was winter in April.

Therefore, the face actually shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. Landforms like that are pretty common around the American West. Facts over time has proven that it was just a landform that isolated messa about he same height as the Face on Mars.

Proven with pixels, in 2001 scientist took photos and compared it to the images in 1976. Also, April 5, 1998 the (MOC) team took some pictures revelaling that is just only a natural landform. Spacecraft rolled 25 degress to center the Face in the field of view, making the image more relevent to see up close.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform created over time and is equivalent to butte or messa landforms. Also their is no real proof that aliens can really create this face on mars that took many years before forming and looking more and more like an Egyptian Pharoah formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.
