I believe that all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity could actually very well help students. Though there clearly is a bad side to taking up your time with a "forced" activity, that isn't always the case. Students tend to complain whenever they're forced to do "useless" things that aren't even necessary, but they also don't look to see why their teachers or principal makes the decision they make. Us students always seem to think of extra work and extracurricular activities as something that won't ever help us in life. So the students will get fustrated by the principal making them do an extracurricular activity because they're "useless" activities, but they can actually end up making long-lasting friends, strengthen a variety of skills to help get them into different things, and they could find a new fantastic hobby that they love-depending on what they join and try out for.

Many students have the hardest time to find that one good friend group that is nice to them and enjoys what they enjoy, but they never seem to try and figure out how to find that right group. Being in at least one extracurricular activity could actually seriously help many troubled students find those people that make them happy. If you join a sports team you could end up becoming very close with your team and then form a tight-knit friend groupÂ that you've longed to have. It also doesn't hurt to join more than one club, because you never know what amazing people you'll find in those clubs. You also can pick whatever team or club you want to join, so students don't have to pick something they don't like and have a terrible time being in what they joined. The students have a wonderful opportunity to pick their choice of club or team and make some new friends.

For the older students, or possibly even younger students, joining that team or club can help you get into your dream college. Lots of students already join their school sports team or clubs to help them strengthen that area of skill so they can get really good at that set of skills and get into that dream thing they've longed for. If you like to swim then go tryout for your school swim team, because maybe you'll end up growing as a swimmer and getting a scholarship from your dream school. If you're not an athlete, no worries! There are so many clubs, such as debate club, art club, film club, and even homework club. You can get help to become a better artist, filmer, or whatever you desire! Extracurricular activities don't just have to be a waste of time, so you should go join that club or team and become amazing at that area of skill.

As I had said before, you have a choice of a wide variety of clubs and school teams that you can join, so why not try out a bunch because you're bound to end up really liking one of them. Schools have so many options to choose from, yet students end up ignoring the clubs and teams because they thing they're a waste of time and boring. If students ended up trying out some clubs or teams they could seriously realize that maybe they enjoy that team, or maybe they're actually a really good writer and want to pursue in writing. I can't stress enough how so many students now a day are sitting around at their house complaining how bored they are because they have nothing to do and they're not good at anything. All those students most likely haven't tried out any teams or clubs to actually try and see if they enjoy it or have the skills for it. It's always your choice to join that club or team, or it's your choice to sit around and complain about that painful and dreaded boredom.

Now there are bad sides to taking up your time in other activities, because you might not have as much free time, but in the end students should seriously open their eyes and see the good that these opportunities at school aren't as bad as they say. I really mean it when I say that you'll find those friends that make school worth coming to, because those friends you find in clubs, teams, and musicals, they're like whole second family. And you'll never know your skills, strengths, and abilities until you end up taking that risk and trying out new things. Once you find those strengths and skills, you'll end up realizing how rare it was that you took that risk to go along with your principal, because now you've found new friends, new incredible hobbies, and possibly a path to your dream school. So yes, maybe you'll loose some precious relaxing free time, but you'll gain a lifetime of rare skills and friends.
