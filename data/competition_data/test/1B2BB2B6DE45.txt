A project over the summer is a great idea for students to continue to learn. On the other hand, allowing teachers to decide on what students should create isn't the best idea. In the summertime, students love to have fun, create new things, and discover. Leaving the project up to them could challenge their creativity and work ethic. It's not only fun for students, but fun for teachers to see what the students bring back.

During my fifth grade science fair, we were allowed to conduct any experiment we wanted. I decided to blow bubbles and see which gum brand made the biggest bubble. This was fun to do because it was what I thought that made it a successful project. In my opinion, I became proud of myself for taking initiative for completing the assignment on my own.

In addition, when it was time to present my own work I didn't have any problems. I knew what I was talking about and it gave me confidence in front of the class. Sharing all the information I was articulate and when answering questions I was assertive. My teacher was surprised with the quality of my lab and she knew I had put lots of time and effort into this.

Nevertheless, In a teachers perspective of giving a controlled project to students is necessary. They don't always see where things could go wrong. A student could be confused about instructions and do the project completely wrong. Some might feel like it's boring and a waste of time. Giving the student the freedom to illustrate and present their own idea is the most creative way to learn.

Therefore, students designing their own project ideas surpass teachers. Making it fun to learn instead of what might feel like a burden. Teachers determine effort and creativity for the most part. It's up to students to demonstrate correctly. Could you do it on your own?Â
