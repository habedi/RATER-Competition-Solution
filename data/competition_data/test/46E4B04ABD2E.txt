Luke Bomberger has went to Europe on a castle boat witch was an offer he couldnt say no to, witch begins the journy of how he came to be a "seagoing cowboy".

Luke has crossed the Atlantic Ocen 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people in harm and in need from the war, witch he states "Im grateful for this opportunity." "It made me more aware of people of their countries and needs."

"It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the East coast of the United States witch had been a ship filled with horses having to be feed every hour but it was all worth it to help the people in need, and after unloading they have all the time to play basketball, tennisse, volleyball, table tennisse.

Even though luke had to work hard he had the benefit of seeing Europe and China , witch has an opportunity of a lifetime for people to see places just like Luke Bomberger did and opening up your eyes to the world.
