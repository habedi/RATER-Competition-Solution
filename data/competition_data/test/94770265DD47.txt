Dear principal,

I agree that students should have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Students will try to do better in school to be able to play a sport, Students will only play a sport if they really want to, and school's grade average will raise.

Many students love to play school sports and will try harder in school if it means that they can play. Many students do not put forth all their effort in school because they don't care. If a student needs to have a B average to be able to play sports many students will start completing all of their homework, start studying for tests, and just put more effort into school just so they can play the sport that they want to. Many students play sports and would do anything to continue to play the sport they love. Studies show that 2 out of 3 students play a sport and 1 out of 15 of those students has a B average or higher.

Students that aren't invested in their sport and don't care much about the sports they play will not try to raise their average but students who do will. That means that only students who are dedicated to sports and will put forth all of their effort for that sport will raise their average. That will give the sports teams more victories and make the school more proud of our teams. "I would do anything to be able to play soccer." comments one of the 8th grade students. This students' love for soccer will compel him to raise his grade to a B average or even higher.

Lastly, if all the students raise their average for school the school's academic ranking will also raise. That could be good for the school because parents will see that their children are getting a great education and they will be more likely to do more for the school like, volunteer, donate money, and supplies. Many schools are having money problems and donations could prove helpful for the district.

Students needing a B average to be able to participate in sports and other activities could prove helpful in many ways such as, students trying harder in school, more invested sport players , and the school's academic ranking will raise a sufficient amount.

Sincerely,

A student
