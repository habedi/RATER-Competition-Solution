Dear principle,

I think that your idea to change the school's policy so that students have to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports is a great idea. It will get students to focus more on their school work so that way they can play the sports they love to play. To be able to play a sport in a school team is a privilege, students should have to work hard in school in order to have that privilege. Since many students have a grade C average, this policy would most likely make a positive learning curve in the grade system. More students would encouraged to get their grades up and they would have a better future because of it. In conclusion, i think that the idea to change the school's policy for a student to have at least a grade B average to participate in a sport is an excellent idea to improve grades.

Your student,
