Some schools require students to complete summer projects over break to assure they continue to learn during break. These summer projects should be student designed because the project will give students a chance to explore their desires, enhance creativity, and to learn responsibility. However, if the assignment was designed by the teacher the project could be sculpted to fit the students needs and strengthen areas of weakness.

To begin, student designed projects gives the opportunity to explore their desires. These projects can help with finding a career that suits them or with finding out ways to enjoy certain activities. For example, when I had science fair I had to come up with my own project. At first the whole situation was scary and i didnt know how or what i was going to do so, i waited till suddenly i had and amazing idea about researching certain buildings and how they were built. Many of the structures I saw on my laptop screen were mesmerizing. This incredible idea led to me eventually led to me studying researching to become an architect. For Example, currently i am taking culinary arts as one of my classes at Patrick Henry High School. In the beginning i was not sure if i had any skills related to this trade but, after being in the class for a week my instructor told me that i should strive to work towards becoming a chef. So I took his advice an now i have found something that truly interest me.

Secondly, student designed projects can enhance creativity. Student designed projects can enhance creativity by making one think outside the box. For example, in my neighborhood my friendÂ lives a couple doors down from me. He came to me asking for help with finding a way to make his idea for a way to make his cat energetic. We came up with a variety of ideas but many of them failed. After almost all of our ideas were trashed for failing we had to think outside the norm. As we were thinking a great idea came to my friend and the idea actually was the solution we needed the whole time.

Thirdly, student designed projects can teach someone to be responsible. When someone has to come up with an idea on their own, they have to be able to manage time and be able to execute their plan. When doing the project by your self you learn to acquire a sense of responsibility. Being more responsible can be useful because it will follow you throughout your whole life. For example, when I did science fair i slacked off almost all of my time and wasnt being responsible. Since I wasnt being responsible I could have gotten a bad grade in my science class and humiliated myself in front of everyone.

In conclusion, student designed projects have many benefits that can help them succeed in life and improve oneself. These benefits can help at work, school, and in everyday situations. Do you believe that projects should be student designed or teacher designed?
