Dear other Americans, I whish you to be a participant in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Unlike other jobs or programs, this program offers you to see the world while also helping others.

A nation like ourselves should not be lazy and do nothing while others in the other countries are suffering. We need to treat others as ourselves and take a stand for each other.

Now that World War 2 is over, we need to fix the mess Germany has made. Some families have cousins or even brothers there. We need to come together and fix this mess. Because when we all come together as one nation, we can achieve anything! From then on we must hope this does not happen again.

Now all I ask is for you to come join me and my colliges as we sail the seas. Maybe you can just take a ship to England to help there. But all we need to do is come together to clean up a mess.

Once you join you will not regret your decision. You will feel like you have achieved something, and you will get to see the world. This mighty journey is not for the faint of heart. Who among you are strong enough and smart enough to take this journey?

The Atlantic is quite an ocean, it will throw everything it has at you. Women are welcome to come to help on land, but the men are the only ones who should be on the sea.

Men are still allowed to help on land if they would like. When the journey starts we need a spotter, a few animal keepers, and a capitain. All of which are open to anyone whom may want it.

We will also have much fun on our way back home. You can play games in the lower decks such as, Table Tennis, Boxing, Whittling, and more. So in conclusion, are you coming with me?
