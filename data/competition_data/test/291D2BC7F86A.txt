Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter regarding the possible new policy change of students grades and their ability to participate in extra-curricular activities. I think your proposition to require students to have a B average to participate in sports is unreasonable. I believe this because if you take a look at the grading scale, a student with a C average is considered as an average student. As you probably know, at our school there is a large amount of students who have and maintain a C average. Your new policy restricts average students from participating in after school activities. I believe this is unfair because many kids take project-based classes that sometimes only have four to five grades entering the grade book a semester. If one kid flukes up and gets a D or an F on his or her first project, they will have to wait quite a long time to bring their average back up in order to participate in extra-curricular activities.

I am all for putting restrictions on students who are failing classes, but kids who have a C average and work hard to maintain that average should not be punished for their grades.

Also, if you raise the standards for qualification to play in after school sports and activities, some of your students may suffer greatly from the effects of the change. I, as a student, know that if fellow students are being pressured to raise a grade higher than what they have, they can end up being bogged down by the pressure and stress. Some students may think that they have no chance in getting a B average, so they give up and just get even worse grades.

We all know that academics come first, and that in order to participate in school sports, students have to work hard in school. Our school's students would suffer and be sad that the C averages they work so hard to achieve will not be good enough to participate in after school sports.

Overall, I think that your possible new policy to require students to maintain a B average is unreasonable because an average grade on the grading scale is a C. This policy would only allow above average students to participate in sports, and while it may propel some students to work harder, it will negatively effect many of our students.

Sincerely,
