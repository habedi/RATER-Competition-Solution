The Seagoing Cowboys Program can convince people because if you had Luke's job you can see the Panama Canal. You can also help people who have been hurt in the war. The job Luke had was to take care of young cattle,horses,and mules. So you would have a chance to take of animals just like Luke did. You can also be apart of the Military Forces and help wounded people. You can also see things that you probably never seen before like Italy,Panama Canal,or China.

It takes two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. You would also care for the animals during the crossings and it will keep you busy. When the war was over the towns were lefted in ruins. So you will be apart off the UNRR ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabiliation Administion). The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Working on farms as a little kid can be great for preparation for the had work but not for the dangers of the sea. If your job my be watchman you have to check on the animals every hour. The job makes you aware of people of other countries and their needs.

In the UNRRA 44 nations will join together and help the animals and people hurt from the war or ohter serve injuries.
