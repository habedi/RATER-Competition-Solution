Dear principal,

I believe that all students should be required to do community service considering that it helps your community and your chances of getting into college. Community service could be as simple and fast as helping clean trash and it helps you because when you try to get into college they like to see community service on your application. When you do community service you help your environment and the people around you because you are taking the first step to helping your city.

I also think community service should be required because most students are lazy and like to sit around all day. But if community service was required it would also get kids moving and exercising and that would also be helping the overweight problem. The least us kids could do is give back to the community and that's why i believe community service should be required.

Sincerely,
