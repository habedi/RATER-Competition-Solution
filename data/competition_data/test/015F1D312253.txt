Intro:

I know some people would love not to have to drive cars around and that's all well and good, but what people don't understand is that driverless cars are dangerous in my opinion. I would rather be safe driving in a car, than to be riding in the car with no driver

Body:

Let's just say that if someone driving a regular car and someone were in a driverless car, it would be the person in the driverless cars fault. Why? Because they don't think they did anything wrong and that they're following the driving laws. I don't think the person that was actually driving in the normal car is at fault, they may seem old fashioned but at least its safer.

Being the cofounder of the Google company doesn't mean you know everything, especially about transportation. This is just an idea but it doesn't mean it should actually happen. I understand that some people love cars that drive for them now but at least they still have steering power. I do however like that cars can brake for you when you're not paying attention. And I know that even driving in normal cars is dangerous, but its much safer being behind the wheel than to be just sitting in the car doing nothing.

Driving shouldn't be fun. It should be about learning, and to me learning isn't very fun. Driving to me should be a symbol of growing up not so you can go pick up your friends and go out. Maybe on some occasions, but overall its just a means of transportation from one place to another. But hey, this is just my point of view.

Conclusion:

Some people may not agree and call me crazy, but at least I know I'll be safe when I'm actually being the steering wheel. I would rather not see so many people in the hospital or dead because they wanted to not have to drive to their destination on their own. Driving isn't a terrible thing, it's when people start getting fed up is the terrible thing.
