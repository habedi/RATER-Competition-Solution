Have you ever thought that maybe a president didnt win because of popular votes or electoral college? I have and of course it was unfair.

first and foremost, votes come close to almost wins a lot. but in my opinion all wins are fair game. if u lose at something that big then its no one elses falt. you have to be a great leader and thrive hard enough. if not then u shouldnt be able to blame electoral college for it or even popularaity votes.

to keep moving, both votes are supposed to be in your favor. so if u still lose from one or the other you probably just sucked. you have to actually try for president. you cant just expect to win because of elctoral college or popularity. you should plan on an even distribution.

to wrap up, i believe that you can not base a win or lose in electoral college. you shouldnt depend on either but should be able to useÂ both. if you blame your loss on the system then you suck.
