In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author included both the negatives and positives that computer-driven cars have to offer. I support the development of these self driven cars. Many are againts the development of computer-driven cars because they believe that they offer more negatives than positive but in reality it brings positive change and is safe, Google has been testing cars that drive themselve independenty since 2009 and they have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.

Computer-driven cars is becoming an idea thats easier to achieve as each day passes and it is a great thing, these cars will use half the fuel of todays taxis and cut down pollution, will be more reliable than regular cars, and decrease car accidents

Only half the fuel of todays taxis is what a computer-driven car will be using. The amount of money one will save due to driverless cars is major. Computer-driven cars will reduce the ammount of feul used, not only benifiting ones pocket but also decreasing pollution. Global warming is a serious problem that is getting bigger and bigger each year. No computer-driven cars will not get rid of global warming but yes they will cut down on the carbon monoxide pollution that is emmited into the atmosphere by transportation, slowing down the growing problem of global warming.

Computer-driven cars will be more reliable than buses and faster than regular cars. Running late to an appointment and any kind of meeting will cease to be a reaccuring thing. Computer-driven cars would be able to take anyone anywhere in a safe and fast way, GPS and the advancment of sensors will allow the selfdriven vehicle to find the fastest route to any destination and find a way around any obstacle that it faces. The computer-driven car wil have advanced technology that will give it the ability to see more than driver and find safe solutions to problems.

The amount of car accidents will drasticly change, decreasing because the self driven vehicle will always be alert and attentive unlike many human drivers. Imprvements in sensors , computer hardware, and software will give the self driven vehicle more control in accidents reducing harm that could be done to drivers. Computer-driven cars will inform the owner if something is wrong with the vehicle preventing any accidents ahead of time. Computer-driven cars will take anyone incapable or not in good condition to drive safely to the destination that they desire. If one is hurt or intoxicated the computer-driven car is what they will need help from, decreasing many car accidents that occur for many reasons.

The develpment of driverless cars is a great thing that is becoming easier to achieve and will fundamentally change the world. These cars will reduce money spent on fuel, having and ecomomical effect on the world. They will also reduce the amount of carbon monoxide pollution that goes into the air that people breath, being more healty for humans and the world. Computer-driven cars will be more reliable and safer than regular cars saving many lives. The developmen of driverless cars should be supported by all.
