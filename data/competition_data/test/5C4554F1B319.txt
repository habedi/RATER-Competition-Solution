Avantages for limiting car usage is a real eye opener. Giving up your cars and walking your kids to and from school and then walk to work is alot of exercise. Also it helps out with the enviroment greatly. Some people even say it makes them feel better or less tense "when I had car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,". This was said by a mother of two and a media trainer.

The pollution caused by cars is a pretty big deal of why we have pollution. In paris they have even partially banned driving. If they do drive then they will get a thirty-one dollar fine if you have an even numberd license plate. Then the the next day it would be an odd numbered license plate "On monday motorists with even-numberd license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31).The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."

Some countries even hold programs every year addressing this situatuon. In Bogota,Columbia they hold a car-free day. Where Colombians either walked or rode bisicles or they hiked and took buses to work that day. This program was held for three years straight and who ever violated this program was to be finned with twenty-five dollars."BOGOTA,Colombia--In a program that set to spread to other countries,millons of colombians hikes,biked,skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city errily devoid of traffic jams."

It helps a lot with exercise I believe. A lot of americans are obeiest because of lack of exercise. This whole idea will certainly help out alot with health and exercise. If you just walk from your house to a block away thats helping your legs and cardiovascular muscles get stronger as well. If we do eventually have an car- free day i believe that pollution and obiesity will also go down.

Also the gas prices will go down and we wouldnt have to borrow oil from other countries as well. If we wouldnt drive so may cars and everyone rides bikes and walk we wouldnt need gas stations and things like that. It would also help with people being fined and not being able to pay for it. It would help D.U.I's since you wouldnt be driving while you were drinking and causes of deaths when a drunk driver hits someone else.

Over all I feel this is a great idea to look into. You would be cutting down on the pollution and gas prices. You would also be cutting down on peoples health like obesity and breathing in hasardious smoke fumes. Also you would be cutting down on the number of deaths due to drunk driving, or texting while driving or over all wrecks in general.
