Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you think thats a good idea ? I think its an amazing idea. My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think thats a great idea. Extracurricular activities are good for you because you can gain a lot from them for example if you do a sport you can get your daily exercise. Extracurricular activities give you life skills like communication, working with other people, etc, witch are good for you in the future and your present lives. A lot of extracurricular activities help you express your ideas and opinions with other people for different things.

You get your daily exercise if you do sports for your extracurricular activities. Football is a great extracurricular activity because you get your daily cardio from it. Doing football,basketball, etc helps you loss weight. Obesity is a big problem in the student body so sports for an extracurricular activity is a good idea for them. Your health gets better and body from the exercise so that can benefit you by helping you perform better in p. e and other sports you might do outside of school. Sports are a good extracurricular activity that makes daily extracurricular activities a good idea but thats not the only reason extracurricular activities are a good idea.

You get life skills from some of the activities. Working on a year book with other students gives you a life skill of working with other people. You get it by working with other people witch you do in the activity your doing. You can also get another very important skill like the communication skill. Communication skills are very important especially in the future when you might be at a job interview. Another skill you can get is patience. Patience is an important life skill you can use for a lot of things in life. You can get a lot of skills from extracurricular activities witch is another reason its a good thing to be apart of and is a good idea. What Im trying to say is that extracurricular activities are a good idea. My last reason is that you get your express your ideas and opinion with others on an activity. How ever some people might say that its a bad idea and extracurricular activities are not nesesary and are a waste of time. But if you really think about it there kind of nesesary and are definitely not a waste of time because of all the benefits you get from there. And they must be nesesary if the principal has decided that all students must participate.
