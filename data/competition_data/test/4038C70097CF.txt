Poof! Cars are starting to disappear. Many cities and countries are prohibiting car use, they feel it would be drop pollution rates. Your probably thinking right now; this is crazy, who would ban cars? Just think about it there are many advantages to not having a car. First, you wouldn'nt have to worry about gas, theres no need to buy gas if you dont have a car. Second, you'll become healthier. Third, more interraction with the world.

All the money you spend on gas.. what a shame! If we didn't have cars you'd have more money, imagine what you would do with all that money. Maybe a nicer house or maybe a nice big pool in the backyard, you'd never know unless you give it a try. I know what your thinking how would I get to work or how would I get to the doctors; they're would still be public transportation to get you to important places.

If there were no cars, many people would be a lot healthier. Not just people, the environment would be a much healthier places. Polution rates go down, less asthma attacks, more fun, no honking, no worrying about wether the kids are alright to be outside by themselves; sounds good to me. There would also be more family bonding, go for nice walks to the park or beach.

Imagine your walking down the street, you know everyone, you stop and talk, maybe laugh. That's what it'd be like with no cars. Not one face on the street that you didn't know. Many gatherings with friends, many laughs, a lot of fun it sounds like.

The car culture is starting to end in many countries and cities including the United States of America. No cars sounds nice, yes maybe you you think there would be many poor effects on the culture but you also have to look at the bright side. More money, you'd become healthier, and you'd have more interractions with world.
