Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student at SCHOOL_NAME, I would like to say that the grade average to play in sports is much too unfair. many students who like to play sports have grade C average in their grades and we would lose more than half of the players on the sports teams. Therefore giving an unfair advantage to the other team. Now I think that we should at least keep the grade requirement to be a C average that way those who have a C average can stay on the team. Having the grade changed to a B average will not only frustrate students, but parents too. If parents are frustrated with the change then no one will be happy because you will get calls of frustration and the kids will be frustrated and have even more focus on the sport and not on school work. Trust me, take this from a kid who had been kicked off of the sports team because of bad grades. The grade requirement should be a C average and not a B average.

I agree one hundred percent that students should have equal balance between school work and sports. That is one of the many things college applicants look for when they choose who will go to the college of their choice. But is it really fair to make the students who have good grades be out numbered by the students on the other team who have bad grades? I think not. A C average would be much easier on the students because then we would have a fair play against other schools instead of being the only school who's grade average for sports is a B. This is also very frustrating for the parent to have to find out what they are going to do for getting their kid home at three o' clock when they are working and don't have any spare keys to the house.

If we have a C average then it will be easier for kids to keep their grades up because they will be scared to keep their grade at a C or below. since they want to keep playing and not have to worry about school work too much. It would also help to have more time for sports. like optional practice. If the athlete knows their parents are going to be a while coming to pick them up they should have the option to stay and practice after practice is through. Like an open gym kind of. I think this would be a great experience for the athlete and the parents.

I hope you will look at this letter and consider what I have asked from you. I do not want to make drastic changes in the grade requirement. just a little tweak to it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
