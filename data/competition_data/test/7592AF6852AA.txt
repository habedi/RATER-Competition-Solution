Phones & Driving

Almost every teen and adult citizen has a phone and a car, and most of them use their phone while operating an automobile. They get distracted, don't know when a light is turning green and hold up traffic, and mostly accidents. They drift out of their lane into another drivers lane and wont look up until the other car has honked or they feel the car not going in the right direction, or will possibly hit someone. Drivers should not drive and use a cellular device because their holding up traffic and putting people's lives in danger from not paying attention to the road. It's safer to get a phone mount for your car so that you won't have to hold the device and keep your hands on the wheel. If your driving on a road, I advice if you only use your phone for navigation and music and stay off social media until you are parked or at your destination. Scrolling through the internet or social media is not worth losing your life or anyone else's life, or damaging you or someone else's vehicle. Therefore, 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their device behind the wheel of an automobile. I think it's best drivers keep their phone out of their hands while driving because its so many people on the road today and your risking you and all their lives because you wanted to be on your phone and not keep your eyes on the road. Just 5 seconds your eyes can be off the road and you'll hit someone. It doesn't take long for your car to take control of what way it goes when you aren't paying attention. There are countless other lives on the road who have futures to look forward to. ItÂ´ll be the right thing to teach the next generation to not have a device in their hand while driving especially with these new cars with technology in them for hands-free driving, its all compatible for your phone but you dont technically use your phone because its all in the car by the touch of a button on the stearing wheel or on the cabin. Most children and teens look up to what other people are doing and think its okay that they do it unless they were tought better not to. Its important to watch what your doing and pay attention to your surroundings, to your children or upcoming drivers thatll be on the road and teach them the right things to do on the road and what to do when something goes wrong.
