Lately, students have been assigned projects from their schools to do over the summer to further continue their academics. These projects have been debated on being either student-designed or teacher-designed. The projects assigned to the students should be teacher-designed because students would be more serious about it, teachers would grade the projects better, and the projects would be easier to comprehend.

Students are known to take things more seriously when they've been formally assigned to them. Teacher-designed projects would make the students focus harder and finish more efficiently on their assignments. Having the students work harder on their projects would increase their learning within the assignment that was handed to them. Projects over summer break should be designed by the teachers, as it is fairly beneficial to the students.

Teachers already have trouble reading some kids' handwriting, why have them grade an entire project designed by them? Grading will be much easier on the teachers, since they made the projects themselves. This means teachers would get through papers much quicker than if designed by students. The teachers should be creating the work that is given to the students over summer, for it puts some ease on the teachers.

Many students are still under educated, and less smarter than teachers. If teachers would make the summer projects, students would comprehend their work much better. Students would then be finishing their assignments with more knowledge and understanding. The projects should be teacher-designed, so students will have the ability to understand their assignments better.

Some may claim that the projects given over summer should be student-designed, as it gives teachers a break. The project rubric and other content would only take a bit of time to create, but then teachers have the entire summer for the kids to finish their work. Teachers would already have to grade the projects, so making them wouldn't be hard at all.

A student's ability to understand, teacher's ease, and a student's academicsÂ should all be taken into consideration when deciding who gets to design the projects handed to students over summer break. With taking into account the multiple reasons stated, it is clear that teachers should be the ones creating these summer projects.
