Phones & Driving

Although phones have a lot of impact in our lives phones are getting better and easier for us to

Use. By that I mean technology is getting better with the generation changing and its a lot easier

Because back in the day like in the 1900's there was flip phones coming out and it was a little

Difficult to use not by answering a call but by texting or trying to find something on the internet.

So with the phones getting better with the years or technology in general it gets to people trying

To multitask or simply trying to answer a text back, a call, or simply just try to look something

Up on the internet. Which comes to being really dangerous when driving and trying to do some

Of those things. Which honestly in my opinion you shouldn't really do that and should wait to

Answer the phone or whatever you are trying to find. Or simply just give your phone to someone

If you have someone with you on the passenger side. Because not waiting to use your phone can

Get you in trouble and you can also lose your live. By what I mean by that is that if you're

Driving and you decide to pick up your phone to just see your social media or a text message and

Your eyes are not on the road like they are supposed to be you can run someone over or simply

Just move on to the other lane next to you and you crash into another oncoming car or simple

Just crash to a pole of a store and if that happens you can lose your life or the other person can.

Image if the other person you crashed into has little kids and something bad happens to their kids

Do you know how much guilt you would have? Cause I would have so much guilt because it was

My fault the other family is suffering just because I wouldn't wait to see my phone. It doesn't

Matter if you think you have that ability to drive and text at the same time you shouldn't do it

Because you never know what can happen to you of whoever you crash into.
