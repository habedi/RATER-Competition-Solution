some people believe that the face on mars is and alien artifact, i believe it is just a landform. there isn't enough evedance for this statement to be true. Although it was a cloudy time on mars when the first picture was taken i can see why people might think it is and alein artifact. But what you are accualy looking at is a mesa with weird shadows on it that make it look like a face. if you look at the picture from 1997 then at the picture from 2001 you can clearly see that their isnt a face. When the fist picture was realesed to the public LOTS of people sthought it was a face. so what do you do if everyone was saying it was an alien artifact? you would probably believe them. some people believe the face on mars is and alein artifact, i believe it is just a landform.
