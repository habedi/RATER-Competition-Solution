"Driverless cars are coming" im not so sure that is a good idea for driverless cars, the name doesnt even sound safe. There are many arguments on the subject of having this new idea or not. Some believe it would be a great addition for the future and others think they should not be invented. In my own opinion i believe that the driverless cars should not be a thing for the future. And there are many reason to why i think that.

Although it is known that many people in america are wanting driverless cars im not so sure that it is the best thing we need. There are some advantages to this like how they may be safer when it comes to the new features they are including. But the dissadvantages by far overcome them. For one, driverless cars are less work and basiclly for the most part you just have to watch the road unless you would like to take control, however, that is a huge problem in this day in age because, everyone is creating new things so everyday jobs arent as hard for people to do but that is just adding to the lazyness of americans. Its one thing to create things like a stove so you dont have to create a fire just to heat your food but to go all the way to not even having to drive your car thats a little to much. This problem is just like the idea of elevators so you dont have to walk up and down stairs thats just a creation made out of pure lazyness. So i think driverless cars are really pushing it when it comes to inventions for the people that make us the lazyest country.

The driverless cars may seem to be more safe although think about even the most high tech items you know of even those get messed up and malfuction sometimes right? So there isnt any doubt in my mind that the car wouldnt either. So if you were to be in the car and say it was supposed tos stop at a red light but it got messed up and it didnt stop it could cause a crash and that could do some real damage to you and the others in the crash. And who would they blame was at fault? would you get the blame or would the car? Its hard to trust internet programed things especialy when it may come to your life. If a person was driving they would know to stop at a red light. But with the driverless cars those are just computers that can mess up at anytime.

It might be dfficult to see eye to eye because now days our natural instinct is to go for the thing that makes your life easier. But we all need to see that even though it may be easier and less work it is also a accendent waiting to happen. Although the new car has safty percautions and you can take control of it doesnt make it perfectly safe and it doesnt make it a good idea. And it might use less gas making you able to save you money but that also means the owners to the gas are lossing there money it all works like a chain reaction.

Making the right decision is important for us to do because of our future generation. Think about how this would be a bad effect on our life and society. in my general opinion the phrase "driverless cars are coming" should not come into affect becuase of the dissadvantages and the bad effects and the pure lazyness that would be put into the idea of the car. So i dont think we should get driverless cars.
