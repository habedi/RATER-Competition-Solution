Now you may be wondering if the face on Mars was created by aliens? I'm gpoing to be completely honest with you, but no it is not. Now you may be saying "Oh you work for NASA so you're just trying to cover it up." Yes I do recall getting hired by NASA, but I do not recall us ever trying to cover up an alien artifact.

In 1976, scientists just figured out it was just unusual shadows making it look like a human's face, but this was the only Martian mesaa in Cydonia that made it look like it has a face. Now ever since then, the "Face on Mars" became a pop icon. It was in a movie,books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even griocery stores. Do you know how long? 25 YEARS!

If there was life on Mars or any other planet and we were trying to hide it then that will be pretty much not smart to do. I mean the NASA budget wish. So in 1998 we took another picture but as it turned out it was...natural landform. But as everyone know. NOT EVERYBODY WAS SATISFIED!!! So on April 8th, 2001 we took another picture and all you saw were landforms for example like the American West. So there is no proof that "The Face On Mars" were created by aliens. Any questions?
