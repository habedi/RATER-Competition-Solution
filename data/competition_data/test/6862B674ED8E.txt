I think that there were definitely alians there. I might not be able to prove it, but I do believe and will someda prove that there are aliens in space. When it comes to the Face I have a hard time proving the whole alien things. I mean like don't believe everything you read. So to me studying the Face is hard

Ok, so NASA is saying 25 years ago they noticed something funny that happened at Mars. I think the thing they spotted was aliens. Besides the red stuff the only weird on Mars would be aliens.

In my opinion, I dont think the Face was created by aliens. So far scientist haven't even see aliens in space so if that's the case how could aliens have created the Face. You know humans had to create that one.

I do think there are aliens in space but I don't think they made the Face. Until scientist find out they aliens exist I'm keep thinking that it was a really smart guy. So come on sicentist lets find out if aliens exist.

Some genius Enstein has made the Face up and blamed it on aliens. But when I grow up I'm going to do more stufy on aliens and fidn out if they really were the ones who invented the Face. But for now whoever the guy is played a really good prank.
