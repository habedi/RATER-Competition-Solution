The authors idea of Venus was a good article, he explains how Venus despite the the volcanoes, earthquakes and the frequent lighting, Venus would still be a good place to study and learn from for are future. I like this idea because we really dont look at other planets like how we study ours and Mars. In the article it explains how Venus has metals and rocks, having different metals and different rocks can help out with things we might need. Having new types of metals could help us make stronger things like, weapons, cars, airplanes and towers. Venus also is a planet that is closer to the sun then we are so we might find something that could help us in the long run. We could maybe find new life and study it for future things. But there is a problem with studing venus....ITS TOO HOT, Venus is close to the sun making it hot like hotter then earth on its hottest day. But NASA came up with a idea. In the article it says that "Imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape" that would help alot becuase then we wouldnt have to send a human t get the information that we need to pull from Venus. So this is why the authors suggests was a great article.
