Dear principal,

One of the main reasons why kids don't do very well in the classrooms, is because they don't get there energy out.

My brother has the same problems, he is always ready to go play outside as soon as he gets home and my mom always yells at him and yet he still does it. He says that he is already done with his homework when he really isn't.

My friends always say that they are doing bad in school, because they don't have any sports to let all there energy out.

I play volleyball, basketball and swimming, and I still get good grades.

The more energy the kids get out of themselves the better they will do in the classrooms.

One of the main reasons why kids have sports is so they cant be bored, I mean kids still need to have fun no matter what, but if they have a sixty or something than maybe we can punish them, but as long as we the kids have a seventy or above we still have a chance to get up and push our selves to the best that we can.

All am saying is to give us a chance to have some fun and do our best in school you never know we could be the most talented grownups when we grow up.

I hope you read this over and over and decide that we can do it.

Sincerely Your, Student
