Hi, name is Luke and I am part of the Seagoing Cowboys program. Many people don't conclude the idea of joining the program, but there are many reasons why you should join this program. I crodded the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice. At first i knew nothing about this program until my friend invited me and now, im glad he did because it was an adventure to never forget.

You get to go on adventures, and visit unique places such as Europe, China, sail across the Atlantic Ocean, and visit Greece. During these adventures you meet new people, see new cultures and how people live. You also help people around the world. When I help people in need I feel good inside knowing that im helping and making a difference in the world. Also we found that we could have fun on the ship, we played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games that fullfilled our time.

Overall, I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy club for these reasons. You feel like a better person by helping people, you see the world and different countries, you go on adventures, and have fun while doing this by playing games and doing hobbies. Why would anyone take up this once and a life time opritunity? This adventure was very rememberful and fun so I think you should join the program and experience the remberable adventure yourself.
