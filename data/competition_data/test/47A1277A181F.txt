my opinion about having to do community service is i don't think we should have to clean up others mess because we pick up after our self and i don't think my parents would let me do community service because i have things to do after school like take care of my brother and clean the house and i don't think other kids moms would let them stay after school because people have things to do like sports or some parents just don't let their kids stay after school and i wouldn't want to do community service any ways because we don't get paid for it or anything and we would be working for nothing and its a waste of my time but i think i would try to tutor some elementary kids because i think it would be fu to help little kids improve on their work and show them how to do better on their work. I think it would be a good idea to give us elementary kids that are not doing very good in school so we can tutor them and show them how to do their work.
