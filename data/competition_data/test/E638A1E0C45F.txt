Even though teachers would make a better choices for students, they should also get to deside for themselves too. Some school offers distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferenaring. I don't think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. there for, students would not care about school. First,students would rather quite learning than to do it online. Second, students wouldn't even want to go to school so why would they waste thier time on a cumputer the hole da? Last but not least,they would do whatever they want ot do because there's no one at home to tell them to focus on thier works. Also students won't pay close attention to learn. For example, they would wake up late to learn. students would play games all day. And also, thier grades would go down instead of going up. Students wouldn't be able to make new friends if they stay at home every day. First, students would be lonely because there are no friends at home to play with after done with homework or fininsed learning. Second, they might think that thier phone and TV would keep the busing but sometimes you find them boring too because you do the same things on your phone over and over again. such as watching TV, posting pictures, commenting and your friends post, texting all your friends, making phone calls and etc. we all like phones i do to, but sometimes we get tierd of them and jut wonder what should i do now? well i will tell you, you should go out and make some new friends and have fun with your life because life is like an uncooked egg if it fells down and breaks you can't put it back together again. also life is shot enjoy it while you still can. It's not a good idea for stidents to stay at home. i know there is no place like home. sometimes i get in trouble with my mother because i stay at home alot so when she wants me to go out she tells me to go to church on sunday. i know what you are thnking, who goes to church to have fun why not go to parties and the mall? well because going to church, you won't meet evil people outside you are always safe in the house of the lord. While some people believe that student would not care about school other aurge that they can be educated at home by thier parents for example, some students wants to be the first to graduate in thier family just like me. They would also get a better job and take care of thier parents. they would have a lot of opportunities that some people are are still looking for regreating for not going to school. Above all, i believe that students can make diffrences and make choices that won't affect them in the future and aslo students attending school at home might not be a good adiea but it would get them closer to thier families.
