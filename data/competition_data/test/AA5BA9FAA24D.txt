Hey there, it is Luke. And I am asking you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. We are running out of people and would really enjoy some more help with the program. I would believe that you would really like this program, you would have the opportunities of a life time! Yourself and many others on the ship would be able to see and explore places that you can only think of.

Are you starting to like the idea of it now? Well I am almost sure that you would love it even more if you were on the ship right now! Expecially if you are a big animal lover why, you might as well hop on right now. Here in the Seagoing Cowboys program there are lots of animals that you can never get tired of! And I know what you are thinking, you are probally thinking about you're family and how much you are going to miss them. I know, that is what I thought about to before I myself joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. But, you really have to think about this. You would be missing out on an adventure of a lifetime! And I think you're family would understand if you were leaving to help people around the world. Mine did! And see some very very cool things while you are out there. After all there is a world out there and you are just waiting to see it.

Now maybe you could at least consider being apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program? I mean, I love it and you could too! Maybe you couldeven pass this note around? Why not ask some close friends and family or some people you know if they might want to join the program too! I think they would love it! Well, maybe you could get back to me about this. And I hope that I can see you soon!
