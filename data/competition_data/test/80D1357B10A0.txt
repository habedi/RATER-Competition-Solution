Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. While some people benefit from staying home, others may prefer the school atmosphere. Either way, it's mostly about personal preference and if it helps in the long run. There shouldn't be a reason to be forced to do one thing or another so having a choice is good. Therefore, students would benefit from taking classes at home because it runs through their schedule and it makes task a little easier.

One thing that is a problem for students nowadays are their schedules. Students have other task other than schools like having a job. Students the older they get, start applying to get hired so they can have money for personal reasons. Sometimes, they might get unreasonable hours and since they have school, it could possibly backfire. A lot of teens may work up to late at night which takes a toll on their sleep and school work. It could even be a point that the student can't do any school work at all and might fall behind. However, if that student took classes online, its a possibility their jobs wont get in the way of their studies. If they could organize the schedule that could benefit his school work and job at the same time, it would help in a big way. Also they can have enough rest since the student doesn't have to wake up at dawn. Their is so much benefits to take online classes.

Another example could be taking care of siblings. Lets just say their mom has to work late so that student has to take care of their bother and sister. The student can't be at school and at home at the same time. There would be no way around that its one or the other. Because there would be nobody who can take care of the kids. Some people could say to just drop them off at a daycare but some people might not have that type of money to spend. Others might say that they could hire a babysitter but that might not work either. In this situation, school seems to be affecting him in a huge way. If he managed his schedule accordingly, he'll have time to take care of the kids and focus on school at home at the same time. Which would mean less stress in total because he'll have time for both kids and schoolwork.

There's people who have different ideas about this topic. They believe that students who take online classes would not benefit at all because the student isn't getting that "hands on learning experience". However, thats not the case with this topic. Some students don't have to learn hands on. There's different types of students in the world that prefer other ways of learning. Since the critics probably learned it that way, they believe everybody else should learn it too and its completely wrong. Thats not how students should benefit. Its all about what makes them comfortable to the point that they can do their work as smooth and as quickly as possible without any problem or confusion.

In conclusion, students who feel like the school environment isn't for them, should just take online classes. There should be no reason to put that much stress on a student when they have daily lives like other people. There's more to life than just school and people don't understand that. The toll it can take on somebody is ridiculous. It's already hard enough in school and plus doing other task outside of class is very stressful. Even though students have a choice to take online classes, it's not talked about often. In total, the ratio of kids going to school except for staying home is huge. Its honestly not that common. However, if its anyway it could be discussed with the school board, it might affect how students are today in general. With all the time the students have on their hands, it's would be way more manageable then ever before. Some people in this world are would probably never understand that issue. They need to do an experiment on which students are more successful. With the results of that experiment, they could take what they got form the experiment and change how students are in the future.
