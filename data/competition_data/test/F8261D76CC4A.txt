I think that the principal should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I think this because if students are using their phones during lunch and other free times they will not be bothering or disturbing anyone. Also students go from class to class without being able to talk yet they are surrounded by their friends. When students get a break they might want to be able to use their phones with out being restricted from socializing, in an even quieter non disturbant way, during their break as well.

Secondly i believe that the principal should let students have their phones during lunch or other free times because they can get the need to talk to someone out so during class they will be able to focus on what they are learning. If a student uses their phone at lunch or another free time they will not want to use it in class and will not have that distraction.

Thirdly, If a student does see nothing wrong or a problem with using their phone during a free time when it is not allowed, and gets it taken away it can cause the student to not have contact with their parents after school. Students rely on parents or guardians to pick them up after school and if they don't have a phone they will not be able to contact a parent. Also students pay a lot of money for their phones and if taken away is not fair.

Lastly, student may have assigned seats during their lunch time and cannot freely talk to their friends. If a student is able to use their phone they will be able to tell their friend what they would like without making any noise or bothering anyone.

In conclusion i think that the principal should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off in class. You will be able to talk to someone with out bothering anyone, will not cause a distraction in class because you have already texted or talked to someone, and kids who have assigned lunch seats will be able to talk to their friends without making a lot of noise.
