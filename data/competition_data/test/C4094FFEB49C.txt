Phones & Driving

It's no secret that cellphones have taken over today's society. We use them in the bathroom, at work, at school, wherever we go our cellphones are attached to our bodies and never seem to be away from us for too long. So it's also no secret that sometimes we use them when we're not supposed to or at the most inappropriate times possible. The tragic truth is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to deadly car crashes. On average, 9 of these daily deaths are related to unfocused driving. Despite these striking numbers, people continue to put their lives as well as other's lives in danger simply because they can't wait. Though some individuals support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid operating their phone at all while driving.

Some say that hands-free set is safe because people can drive using both their hands. But, hands-free devices don't exclude the threat of causing an accident and may even be worse. Researches show that using a headset or ear/headphones can be as hazardous as holding a phone because the conversations sidetracks drivers from concentrating on the road. The problem is when a car swerves suddenly or a pedestrian step into the road, and the brain lacks the processing power to respond in time. So the problem isn't holding the wheel and the cell phone at the same time, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at that particular time. Drivers need to put all their focus on driving and paying attention to their surroundings so they can keep themselves and other as safe as possible.

Workers that are lawyers or businessmen of any kind may argue that their hectic lives and chaotic work schedule require them to always be in the reach of their cellphone. As understandable as this is, they are unaware that the habits they are creating could lead to serious danger.

Business matters can be tense and unsafe while driving because it can cause emotional responses that can lead to disaster. They may get in a heated argument with a coworker and get upset, this can lower their driving ability and cloud their judgement that can lead to them losing control of the car. Work should never be more valued than a life. So if people don't make a choice to put away their cell phones their routine and hazardous habits can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that cell phones are blameless because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. Though, this could be acceptable in some cases, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or they can't reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully hinge on having a cell phone because they are not reliable and are not guaranteed to help you when you need it to.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of deaths on the roads and around the world will continue to increase. It is our duty to implicate good habits into those around us. People will continue to die if a change is not made immediately. It is the peoples' responsibility to not danger their own and others people lives. It can wait.
