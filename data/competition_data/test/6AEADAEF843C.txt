Should we operate a cell phone while driving?

Operating a cell while driving has always been a problem nationwide .The amount of people who think its ok operate a cell phone is ridiculous. The national safety council reports that 1.6 million crashes happen each year because of a person using their cell phone while driving. Most of the reasons why there is so many crashes is people can't wait to text their friends and end up getting distracted. Which leads them to hitting something or someone it's just sad that people can't wait to text their friends.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 meters per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you. Other figures suggest that someone dumb enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.

My conclusion is that every time you drive while using your cell phone. You not only put yourself in danger but you put the people around you in danger as well I rather see you live another day. We all know it's tempting sometimes to cheek if we got a message or who is calling us but that little second can change your whole life. That's why some people recommend you turn off your phone or put you phone on vibrate so that you won't be to tempted to pick up your phone. Look driving in the highways is dangers because of all the accidents that happen and by you using your cell phone makes it more dangers then it already is. The phone can easily be replaced if dropped or squashed but a live human being cannot.
