Dear Principal

Community service should not be given to every student at this school and community service takes to much time on what you can learn about in school and it will take time away from learning so you can get your education and that can take time from anything on what you have plans for or plans for having a party for your brother or anyone from your family and community service just takes time away from your family and friends depends on what kind of community service you will be doing i will be doing community service with my cousin but it will mess up your school when you will come to school and community service is very important because you have to do because it is the law's order if you don't do you will get caught and they will take you in if you don't do what you have to do and they will get you if you do your lob at all and they will not give you another chance if you don't do the community service and you will learn something new once you do community service and community service will mess up every thing and even mess up your school time when you go to school that same day that you have to do community service.
