The main advantages that people seem to find in the less use of cars is that the bad and harmful emissions given off are being reduced. The amount of emissions entering our air daily is beyond belief. In Germany, passenger cars are guilty for 12 percent of the emissions; while here in America we give off 57 percent. Germany has made the change to allow you to have a car if it is parked in a city garage not near the living quarters, or you can pay $40,000 to have your own "large" garage. All malls, stores and parks are just within a walking distance. With the decrease in the number of cars, the access of public transportation has rose. Paris has recently joined this trend. Days after the record amount of pollution in the air clean air was just a must for these people. the next day you were ordered to leave your cars in the garage or you would be fined a fine of 22 euros($31 dollars).

Within the lack of cars moving around the people, digestion was down 60 percent in as little as 5 days. 27 people wanted to avoid the fine so they had their cars impounded. France blamed the Diesael fuel. Diseal makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The goal is to promote alternative transportation. The idea that transportation emissions need to go away has led to this, " these people are generating a revolutinary change. This change is crossing our borders." Imagine bright red and yellow slides, green and blue swings with tons of kids runing and screaming together, or 24 kids all split up into teams for a fun, friendly neighborhood game of kickball. This is what could happen if more countries begin to do what Columbia did. Children would have more access to parks and sports centers. With the sidewalks cleaned up, new restaurants and shopping malls have been added in which makes th city seem more inviting, clean and happy place to be.
