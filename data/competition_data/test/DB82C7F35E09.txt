In my opinion, students would benefit from working at home. Distant learning can help in many ways. The idea of distant learning could put less stress on students as a whole. And make a teachers job a little bit easier. It could possibly solve issues that students have in schools. Distant learning can also help the students that dont like school. Being successful would be a lot easier, do to the fact more learning exercises would be put to use.

Working at home would be a good idea for the the people that dislike school. If a student is more comfortable at home, they would perform better on the work their doing. Some students get distracted easily and can't focus around a large amount of people. Being at home would eliminate some of the distractions that occur while at school. To do school work at home is a big responsibility. Although, high school student are mature enough to handle the responsibility of working at home. The students that think they would do a better job at home should be granted the opportunity to do so. If students feels they would do better learning a different way i dont see why they should be stopped.

It'll be less stressful for teachers as well. They would have smaller classes to teach. Which means they can be more available to the students in their classrooms. Teachers would be able to accomplish more if their class has a full understanding on whats being taught to them. Therefore they can teach a consistent pace that everybody comfortable with. There will also be more room to help the students that learn at a slower pace than others. Students could be more confident knowing they have help when needed when they feel like their struggling.

The students that get bullied and picked on may not want to go to school. If they feel as if school is not safe for them, that can mentally mess them up. Bullying is a big issue for schools in the United States. If the students that are getting bullied dont have to go to school, they would feel more safe. If those same students worked at home, they would feel safe and still receive an education. I would rather for my kids to do school work at home if they was constantly being bullied.

In conclusion, distant learning has it's ways of helping students. It would solve majority of the issues at school. It can boost the confidence in the people that dont like school. Options are expanded by introducing more ways to get you education. Having that in place could make more teenagers successful.
