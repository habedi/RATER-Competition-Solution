Its just a Martian mesa from the red planet Cydonia. It's not made up by aliens its just a landform. Even if the the landmark was an alien made thing then where are the aliens. If people are checking up on this everday and keeping watch you would be able to see these "aliens". So when you think of it getting made by aliens its probaly not the best choice if you have no proof.

If it was made up by aliens then why is it not looking like a face more and more when we look more in to it. We got proof that it isn't made from an alien, "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA'S Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what really is: A mesa." That was in May of 2001, and it can't be anything made from an alien. People who believe that it was made from aliens made the stuff up, like put it in a magazines, radio talks to make a big deal out of it even though it is just a land mark. Those scientests didn't look in to it because it says "become a pop icon" and people think that they know stuff about it and really they don't. You gotta look into it before making a big deal about it.

You need proof, like proof that aliens did make this. Garvin says "It's not easy to target Cydinia, in fact, it's hard work." See hard work not just assuming. You guys have some reasons why like "They might be watching in the shadows of it" but where is the proof they actually exsist.
