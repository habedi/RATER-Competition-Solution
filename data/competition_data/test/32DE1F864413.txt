Human emotions are a pain sometimes because some of the time you can't tell whe someone is faking a smile or just being fake in general. I think having a computer facial recongition is a great idea.

The computer reconigition can be great for inside a class room. In paragraph 6 it states" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Now i think that is an amazing idea it would help each and every one of the students across the world. Admit it who likes to be confused because i sure don't. If we are able to invent something like that it would be a world changing product

Also it can show if a child or even an adult is having a sign of depression in life. People keep emotions bottled up and it is not good for people, a lot people who tend to be depressed don't really like to talk to anyone about they're problems but it could be a life saver if the case needed to be done. Even if something makes you smile fakely in paragraoh 7 they say " raise your lips at the corner of your mouth, squint your eyes slighy..., holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes." now if you follow those rules you even start to smile and feel happy for a second.

In the end the professors that made this invention are genius's because they may have saved many lifes and people who don't pay attention. There are so many other things that you can think of to make it help. Finally overall the facial expression reconigiton is all in all a great invention.
