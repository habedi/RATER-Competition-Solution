There is a lot of different theories about whether or not we need to stop using cars or use natural things for gas. In the four passages I read about the German Suburb, Paris bans, car-free day in Bogota, and The End of the Car Culture. All of these passages make very good logical points. There are many different ways to look at all of these passages so ill explain the best I can.

Recently in Germany everyone is feeling like they want a car-free environment. In the suburbs this can be nice. Having malls not on the big highways away from town, they could have a mall on a main street. It could be a "walk away" mall. So you didnt have to waste gas and pollute the air. Its been recorded that 12% of greenhouse emissions in Europe are from passenger cars. In Paris there have banned driving because the smog is so bad. To all even numbered license plate numbers they have to leave there cars at home. The following day the odd numbered would have to do the same. If you did not follow the rules they unforced you would be fined 22 euros ($31), or your car would get impounded. They almost got up to there record pollution, which is almost as bad as China or Japan.

In Bogota they have not had cars for 3 years. They have been banned besides busses and taxis. The parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Because everyone is walking or riding bikes and at the park. If you don't have much money than you will spend the majority of your time getting places on your own like biking, walking, running, skating, and stuff like that. Therfore the obesoty rate will hopefully go down, the people living there will be healthier and happier. Another theory of cars is that were done with them. Some reseachers think that we are recently not into cars and arent using them as much. They think that we will slowly not need them and stop using them all together. Then have no cars and eberyone will be healthier haveing to get places on there own by foot or bike or something like that. Also once you stop using a car its hard to start using it again.

All in all theres no real proven right idea about cars and what will happen to us, the earth, and cars. We will find out someday. We might even learn how to fly by then too. We just never know until the day is here.
