Dear Principal,

I think you should go with policy one. Students should be able to have their cell phones out during lunch or free time. the teachers should have a say if the students can have their cell phones during class. During lunch students should be allowed to have their cell phones out unless they are causing a problem and most likely the will not be causing a problem. everyone will have their cell phones out. I positive reason to have their cell phones at lunch would be to call home if they needed something important or personal and was too embarrassed to ask the teachers. Another strong reason would be for people to be entertained during study hall, lunch, passing periods, and so on. some schools do not let students have their cell phones out during class but lunch and passing periods are different. Students would not disturb other students the would not even notice if everyone can do it.

Policy two is unfair because students should be able to use their phones during free time if teachers can use theirs. Everyone such as students, staff, and visitors should all follow the same rules. So if our school has policy two it will be fair for everyone to use their cell phones at appropriate times. Teachers when they have prep period and lunch they will most likely use their phones, so why can't the student? We deserve a fair chance with cell phones at lunch and free times.

If everyone is going by the same rules it will be good. The school could accept cell phones during certain times and I am sure everyone will follow them so they get extra time on their cell phones. If the school changes ideas they will not have many incidents with cell phones in the class room. Many students would respect the new rule because they get extra time to use their phones during lunch and free time. the students and teachers will be like equals. This will make good results for the school.

If you look around while teachers are bust on the phone or looking at the computer. You will see students all around hiding their cell phones from teachers texting. Teachers do not notice because they are busy but students do it all the time. To resolve this problem you can put policy one into affect. Students will not have to hide from the teachers they will be okay. For students to hide what they are doing. In some way if you put policy two into affect it will make bad students. It will encourage the students to hide things from the teachers, friends, maybe even parents.

Sincerely,
