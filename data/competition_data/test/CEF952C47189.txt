TEACHER_NAME(principal)

I think we should have all students do community service.

We can start by doing service in the school by helping it keep clean.

we can also clean up our streets and we could have some kids donate food to a homeless shelter. The reason why we should do all this is because so the people that can't afford food can have something to eat. Picking up trash can be a great way to help the earth.

I have some friends that would love to help out with this and plus you won't be board because you will have your friends with you to keep you company and also help out in your community. This junior high school has a lot of thing that we students can do to make it a nice school like we could pick up trash if we see it in the hallways just by doing that we make it cleaner and keeping out lunch rooms clean that could make it clean too. We can donate food that goes to waste everyday at this school to anther school or homeless shelter that needs the extra help. If we just take some time out of what we do everyday and just help by visiting a nursing home and we could just make their day and students could go play with little kids and read them books. This is why I think all students should do community service and plus your helping out your community the place where you live and just by doing all that you could make a big difference.
