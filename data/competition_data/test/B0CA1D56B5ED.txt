Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Can we bring our phone to school because something might come up with our family and we really need to know. If we leave our phones at home how are we going to know if we have a death in the family. Sometimes we have to ride the bus over somebody else house but, if we leave the phone at home how we going to call around to see what is what. If you let us bring our phone we can turn it off and use it when class is over if something pop up. Are we can have them during free time and when it over just turn it off. It really would be great if the teacher don't trust us they can keep it for us. But the ones that don't do their work in the classroom and just talk on the phone all day you can take their phone and tell their parent to come and get it. It really would work if we get finish with our work first before we do anything. Because if we just talk on the phones and not do our work we can flunk. Are if our grades is good then the teachers can let us use them. But we need to make sure we keep them in our pocket at all time because peoples will try to still them.
