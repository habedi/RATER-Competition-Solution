Dear principal,

I think student should bring sell phones to school. But they can't use the sell phone during school hours. Because they would be on there phones instead of doing what there told. They can use them after school hours. the sell phones would be a problem doing the school hours because they would not do they work, they would not do anything. They would also cheat on tests.

The students would not learn anything if they would be able to use there sell phones in class. They came to hopefully to learn in school. The sell phones would be a problem in school. They can bring there sell phone to school but it has to be off.

the students would not listen to teacher. They would be on there sell phones. The teacher would be talking to a wall. The phones would be going off like crazy and nobody would able constertrat
