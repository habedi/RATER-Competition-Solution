The technology, Facial Action Coding System (FACS) was created to recognize peoples thoughts/emotions through a facial coding system by the muscles or movements in your face. Created by Prof. Thomas Huang, he tested it on Leonardo da Vinvi's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Not only does this technology just recognize your emotions, but on a computer, it can respond to your emotions as well. Dr. Huang's new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The real question is, would this be helpful or benefit us in a classroom? I think yes. The author states that "If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar one might follow." Can you imagine having a computer that knows when your happy or sad? Having computers like these in school classrooms would be so valuable, due to the lack of "fun" in school, these computers could determine when youre bored in class and change something about it. Or say you're learning a new lesson in math class, and you're becoming very confused. The computer would recognize your confusion by the facial expression you have and help you out. Dr. Huang says, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." Another reason this technology would be helpful is because it would be less physical work and planning for the teacher. Teachers wouldn't have to deal with their students being bored, confused, or falling asleep in their class while they are teaching. This technology could greaty change the way class goes during a school day in many positive ways.

The new technology 'FACS' can encode any emotion of yours, this would be so helpful to us students in school for important reasons such as, being sad, or being confused. If so, the computer can modify things or help you out. Dr. Huang did an incredible job of creating this masterpiece, he stated that "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional commnication, so computers need to understand that too." This technology could change the world, since us humans now of days are so addicted to our phones. This computer can not only help us in school but be a new way of emotionally and physically communicating with other people. In school classrooms, and at home. The Facial Action Coding System is a very valuable thing.
