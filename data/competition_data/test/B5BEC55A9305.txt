Dear principal,

I do not think it is fair that you are requesting students to possess a t least a grade B average because, to some students use sports to "get away" at and some students struggle to achieve high academic grades in class.

To begin with, to certain students they use sports to " get away".

Some kids use sports to get away from struggles at home, having to deal with drama or certain stress they may have.

Now Students have so much stress and drama that some come to the conclusion of suicide, sports may be a vent were the don't have to worry about things. Students may feel like sports are the only thing in which they don't have to worry about things. It could be a place where they can meet up with their friends who they know wont cause stress and you would be taking that away from them.

In addition, Some students struggle to achieve high academic grades in class.

Getting good grades most times isn't easy. Some students have high school credit classes and honors classes and this is hard to be in. Students can get nerves during test and not score as great of a grade as they could because of this. It wouldn't be fair if a few bad test grades would not only cause their grades to suffer but to punish them away from a sport. Also i think a grade C average is just fine because for those who struggle to get high grades it is an easier step. It wouldn't limit them from doing something that they really want to do or that they have fun in doing.

In conclusion, I do not think it is fair if you change the policy to having a grade B average because, it wouldn't allow students to " get away " from stress and it wouldn't be fair for the students who struggle to get high academic grades.
