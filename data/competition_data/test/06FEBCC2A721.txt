Dear Senator,

It is my belief that there is something unfair about the electorial college. Shouldn't the voters opinions matter?

With the way things are running now, the answer to that is a big, fat, no.

If we, the voters, vote for a presidential candidate and he/she gets the popular vote, then we want he/she to lead our country. But with the electorial college, what you're saying is basicallly, "We acknowledge that you like this candidate, but we don't, so your votes don't count". But please Senator, correct me if I'm wrong.

Another thing that grinds my gears is the fact that, by voting for a presidential candidate, you also vote for 34 or so electors pledged to the candidate. What if one of those electors recently caused a scandal? How can i trust them?

One thing I can not stand is dirty politics. But dirty politics is all we, the people, have been exposed to recently. How can I put my trust in the government with scandals left and right?

If you can not trust that your votes will be taken into account, how can you trust the leaders of your country?

Sincerely,

A Concerned Floridian
