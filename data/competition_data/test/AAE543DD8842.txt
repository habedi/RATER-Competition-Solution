In 1976 a NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars looking and taking pictures of places where Viking 2 could land. It spotted a shadow that looked like a human face. It was a huge head about 2 miles from one end to the other end. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Some scientists figured out it was just a mesa but people started thinking it could be proof that aliens were real. They then started making movies of the face and magazines and stuff like that because they believed aliens had created the face.

NASA already knew it was just a common mesa. NASA and the scientists already knew it was a mesa but it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. As soon as they showed the public the picture people started believing that it could be evidence that aliens created that and are living. Hollywood started making movies, books, and a lot of other stuff. Scientists wanted to be sure that it was just a mesa, so NASA then sent another spacecraft. They took another picture and saw that it looked nothing like the first picture. They had to send another spacecraft in 2001 just to make sure it wasn't a mistake and to see which one was correct. The picture looked different too but looked so much better so NASA and scientists told the public it was a mesa.

The face in Mars was just a natural landform. The same thing basically happens around Western America. A guy, Garvin, said that the face reminds him of Middle Butte in Idaho. He said, "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height at the face on Mars." The first picture they took in 1976 of the face really looks like not a natural landform. As the cameras got more better, in 1998, the face kind of still had the face shape but it looked more flat. The picture in 2001 just made the face look just like a natural landform. The 2001 picture, which is the latest one, shows no proof of living things in mars. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh in the first picture they took. The latest picture, in 2001, the face looked like a butte or mesa. The face was just a natural landform like the landforms that happen in Western America. If it was proof that there is living things in Mars, it would be beneficial for both tax payers and NASA. Hopefully they'll go again soon and take pictures to confirm if it was a natural landform or it's really proof that there is living things in mars, but I don't think they're going to go again because a lot of people now believe it was just a natural landform.

At last, the face was just a natural landform and was not made by aliens. The face did really look like it was created because that's what the people in ancient times bascically did but it was just a landform. The picture first picture was really cool not going to lie and I thought it was created by a living thing but when I saw the recent pictures it just started to look like a natural landform. Maybe they'll find more evidence and confirm if it was just a natural landform or if it was created by aliens, who knows.
