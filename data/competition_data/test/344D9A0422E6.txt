Dear principle,

We should not have to have maintain a B average just to play a school sport. We as the students should be able to play sports with a high C average, and also maintain or make that grade a lot better.

Therefore I disagree that we must have a B average to attend school sports.

If we start putting up that we must have a B average then less children would try out for the sports thus shutting them down. Also if you make the students left with no other choice but to make a B average you would lose those students to the streets where you don't want them. As you would see that if you were to make the B average just to try out for sports then you would most likely lost some of your best players from the C average group. These school sports are the reason so many children want to go to school.

If you keep it at a C average then the students will keep out of the streets and away from harms way more than if you were to put up that you must have a B average. School sports are needed to keep students like us out of trouble. It'll be a good thing to keep the C average, because most of our great sports players are a C average. it would also give those students a chance to make their selves a lot better than they really are. The student who support our schools want our school to win and be proud that we won.

Therefore we should not allow only B average students to school sports it is just unfair to the students who are struggling to just make their C average, and if you were to change it most kids would believe that they are not meeting the standards to be on that team. Also it would cause a dramatic scar on the students life. You would want that student to try to make their grades better on their own not for just some sport.

Sincerely,
