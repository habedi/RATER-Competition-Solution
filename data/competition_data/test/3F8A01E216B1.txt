How would you feel if your principal said it is mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? It could be anything like sports, you could work on the year book, or serve on the student council. Some of you may wonder if this would be a good idea or not to make it mandatory to participate in these activity. In my opinion, I think this would not be a great idea to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. In this essay I will give specific details and examples why I think this wouldn't be a good idea.

One of my reasons why I think that making it mandatory to do an activity isn't a good idea is because of different peoples attitude. Some people may have a great reaction to knowing and some others may not even care because maybe they are in an extracurricular activity now. Others could have a negative reaction to it which could be a problem. A reason why this could be a problem is because if they act negatively to this,they could make it hard on the teacher giving them bad attitudes to the teacher make it a whole lot stressful for the teacher if the student doesn't want to be there.

Some people may think that this could be a good thing because it could maybe help students in different ways. Being in a extracurricular activity like Sports could maybe help people be more athletic then they already are. To those who want to be athletic being in something like sports could dramatically help them get what they want to accomplish. Being in a extracurricular activity like maybe some kind of math activity could help different people learn what they want or need to learn. Some people could just like it in general because they can do something they always wanted to and now have the chance to.

Lastly another reason why I think this wouldn't be a good idea is because of maybe cause of the parents. what would they do then if a parent of a child doesn't want there child to participate or don't want them to do a extracurricular activity? Then what would the principal do in these kind of problems? These are all things the principal would have to think about before making a decision to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. Another thing you have to think about is if a student has a disorder or has some kind of sickness mentally or physically then what would the principal do?

These are all valuable reasons and things that play a big part in making a big decision like this. The principal has a lot of things to do/ think about before making a decision like this. I gave reasons why this could be a good thing but, I also gave reasoning on my opinion which is to not make this a mandatory thing. Ultimately I think this wouldn't be a good decision at all and this shouldn't be a mandatory thing.
