You people could really do good with your life. You should join the SeaGoing program for sightseeing, a good expirence, and helping others recover what they have lost. Sightseeing is great becaue you get to see things that wil probably be a once in a life expirence. Getting a good expirence from all of this would be positive for your mind and your body. Helping others is the main reason that you should do this whole SeaGoing program! It woud be great for you to get out and see the world!

It would be great for you to go out and see the world, and it is pretty amazing. The trip to Europe is pretty educational, and humbling. You can learn about tides, and seafare, as well as swells and knots. These are all things I have learned over my "nine trips---the most of any SeaGoing Cowboy." It is also great for getting to know others, and learning about different cultures. Another very interesting topic that is brought up when you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys is the sightseeing.

Sightseeing is a great part of these trips. You see, when you get to wherever you are delivering you don't have to do the drop off as well. All you have to do is wait for the sailors but until then you get to look at the attractions. For instance, I saw "the Acropolis in Greece" which normally you have to buy plane tickets or boat tickets to get to Greece but when you join you get see these attractions virtually free! I also got to "take a gondalo ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water!"

But the most important part is helping others.

Helping others is the whole reason you should sign-up. You are doing somethining good, not for your self, but for the world, or a specific part of the world anyway. You are also stepping out of your way to help others, you will be rewarded for what you did on Earth in heaven. You will probably, unknowingly save lives while doing this. Helping people is actually good for our brains, it makes us more satisfied with ourselves and we become happier, healthier, and more fun to be around!

You may be thinking we shouldn't go because we like our lives here. Well step outside your comfort zone, stand up for those people who need us, and be the man that says "I will go and help these people!"

So, in conclusion you should come and join SeaGoing Cowboys and help us help others, see amazing things, and just have a good time! Come and let us save people, have a good time ourselves, and see wonders beyond our home!
