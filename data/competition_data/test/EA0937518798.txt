Not using cars is not a bad thing in fact it's a plus. The record shows that 70 percent of familes of Vauban, Germany's population does not have a car and are way more happier. One lady stated "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much more happier. I would agree with her because on top of driving in germany you have to make sure you ddont hit anybody either and thats more tensse and stressful. Being "car-free"is not so bad actually i mean im not the only one that hates all the bad smoke it produces. It does not make sense that a beautiful city like Paris can't be enjoyed because of pollution. I applaud Paris for there act on this pollution problem as they have put a partial ban on car use throughout the global city. In my honest opinion i think that was a smart move because Paris has a thing for diesel fuel and that has been to blame for the polluted airs. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehivles in Paris. Diesel has polluted ais so bad the city of paris has been compared to there rival Bejing , China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. The facts dont lie so take this into consideration of limiting car use .
