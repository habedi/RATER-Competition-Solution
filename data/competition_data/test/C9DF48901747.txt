So you say the discovery of the face Cydonia that was founded in Mars back in 1976 was created by aliens. I seem to disagree with your argument. As we have done more research here in NASA back in 2001 each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 image which means with the new and more improved technology we got a closer and better resolution of the face Cydonia on Mars which you so think was created by aliens. The recent image of Cydonia from 2001 has better pixel quality so that we can zoom in more to see if there are any other objects other than Cydonia such as cars or houses in which we both know don't exist in the red planet. Cydonia has unusual shadows that make it resemble a human head with it giving us an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalent of a butte Mesa which are also landforms that are commonly found in the American West. So as you know that after the discovery, photographing Cydonia has became one of our main priority for us here at NASA to prove that it wasn't created by aliens. I hope that after you heard my side of the argument you have a different view of Cydonia as it formed by itself in the red planet.
