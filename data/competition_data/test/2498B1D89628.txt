Dear Mr. Principal,

Cell phones should be a privilege each student should receive. Students should be able to use their phones during lunch period or other free time. As long as it will be off during class. Students should be able to use their phones during free time for important emergencies and parent contact for an important reason. Also students should be able to use are phone to send a text message to a friend about something they need to talk about.

During free time students should be allowed to use phones to contact their friends or family if anything happened to them. If your child was in school when something happened to them wouldn't you want to know about it? Wouldn't you want to find out how it happened and help them? That's why I think cell phones are an important device to have with you if anything happens. You could call for help or be able to call your friends to talk to them.

Kids these days like electronics. That's what's its all about. Texting friends and playing games. Kids should have a privilege like that in school. During free time or when their walking the track. Kids should be able to listen to music and text. I think we should be able to use our phones without having a teacher yell at you for having it out or taking them away doesn't it sometime get annoying to keep taking phones?

You should allow students to use phones for many reasons. It wouldn't make a difference if they used it during free time. They aren't doing any work at that time so why not let them use their phones. You should think about it. Think about when a kid is going through something hard in school or if something happened and they disappeared. No one would want that to be their child and you wouldn't want that to be yours would you? Cell phones could be distracting but its for a good cause. A cause to save someone's life. You think about that.

Sincerely, a
