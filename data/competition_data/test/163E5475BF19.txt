Did you know there were 4 different emotions detected in the famous Mona Lisa painting?

Do you wanna know how it was abe to be detected? Well Prof. Thomas Huang in colaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe invinted a way for computers to be able to figure out how you are feeling based on your face.

I do feel like the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I feel like it is valuable because the problem in school nowadays it the problem with being bored. When we become bored, we could careless with whats going on and we become less engaged. The text states "a classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." So when the computer can catch bordem a head of time, nothing else should be an issue.

In conclusion if we can get around the fact of becoming bored we wouldn't have to worry about attendence in school, naps in school, or test scores/ grades in school.
