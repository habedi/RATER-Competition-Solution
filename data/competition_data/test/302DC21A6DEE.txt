Have you ever been in a situation where you were excited to start a project but found out it was designed by your teacher who is very uncreative, because I have! Summer projects should be student-designed because students can embrace their creativity and can also be a great chance to learn how to complete things on their own. There was a time when my class had to complete a project that was teacher-designed, which dis-encouraged students to even start the project because the teachers choice of design was not creative, but more basic and boring. When students have the opportunity to create something, they really tend to express themselves more and may even be delighted to complete the task. This shows that when teachers assign something that was created with their own personal ideas and designs, it can really take away the great experience students have when they create something with their own ideas.

Some people may say teachers should be the only ones to design things for students for a better learning experience, however they are wrong because students will never get anywhere in life when things are half way completed for them. Recalling the well known phrase "getting hand fed will get you nowhere", students should always have the opportunity to do things on their own because they can get the chance to learn and grow from their own mistakes. When teachers actually give the students an opportunity to do something on their own, they may seek guidance but you shouldn't try to wage your opinions and overpower their own ideas. These summer projects should always be student-designed and these are my reasonings.
