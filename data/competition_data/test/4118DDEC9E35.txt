Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that it should not be mandatory that students must perform community. Although community service is a good thing and it would be great if everyone did perform community service, i don't think it should be mandatory. Some students have other things to do after school hours. For instance, after I arrive home after school i usually have a TON

of homework to do, not to mention the ongoing projects i also must complete. After i complete my homework i must do chores. My chores consist of doing the laundry, washing the dishes, walking the dog and cleaning my room. If i happen to finish all of my homework AND chores then by that time it is usually dark outside. Doing all of this work leaves all most no time for my personal stuff that i want to do. Even though i would like to help out the community and do community service, I just don't have the time to. I remember one time when i stayed after school to help my favorite teacher clean her classroom. I stayed about and hour after school sweeping and organizing monotonously. By the time I got home I didn't even have enough time to complete my homework, not to mention all the chores i had to do. This event can be compared to community service. If community service is mandatory then i think that a lot of students wont have time to complete the things there are required to do. I also think that a lot of students do similar things that I do. If you make community service mandatory, i doubt that a lot of students will have the time to complete it due to after school activities or chores. I think that community service should be optional to do in your spare time, not mandatory for everyone! So TEACHER_NAME, I insist that you should not make community service mandatory in our school.

sincerely,
