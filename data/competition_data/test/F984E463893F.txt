Many students go to school every day. Some students have chosen to do online schooling rather than the traditional public school. Students would not benefit from online schooling because they are not prepared for the real world and they miss out on social interaction.

First of all students are not prepared for the real world. If a kid always does online school and never goes to a regular school, they won't realize how the world works. Students benefit from going to school by learning a schedule. A kid who does online school might not have as much of a schedule and be confused in the real world. Kids also benefit from going to school because they learn that for a majority of jobs you'd have, you'd need to be out of the house for them, not online. If a student did online school their whole life, they might struggle and be uncomfortable in the world.

Additionally, Students miss out on social interaction. If a student is always at home for school, they will miss out on a lot. For example, a student could miss out on making good friends and relationships with teachers. Students' relationships with friends and teachers can last a lifetime. While some students benefit from online schooling and excel at it, it is not the best way for a child to learn. Children need to be able to go to school and have social interactions so they can learn from their mistakes. Social interactions in children and teens is very important at their age and can teach them right from wrong.

Every day many students go to school. Some have chosen to do online school, while others stick to the traditional ways. Students will not benefit from online school because they are not prepared for the real world and they miss out on social interaction.
