I know cars are the center of our lifes, it's how we get from place to place. So when I tell you that limiting car usage could actually be better for us you would probably tell me i'm crazy. Studies show that people are less stressed without cars, there is less greenhouse gases in the atmoshere, and lower smog.

We probably would not think that limiting our car usage and walking more would make us less stressed. It's true a city in Germany has gone car free. They did a survey on everybody in town and they all say that it has reduced there stress. You are always stressed while you are driving, worried you are going to crash into someone, worried someone will crash into you. Everyone would be happier if we just got rid of cars.

Another benefit about limiting car usage is that there is less greenhouse gases going into the atmoshere. Scientists did a study if we did not use cars the temperature would be three to four degrease cooler in the summer. So just think when the temperature is in the 90's you are going to want that four degrease difference. Cars are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gases here in the united states. The greenhouse gases slowly eat away at the ozone layer making it thinner and thinner, that's what is making the temperature hotter and hotter.

These are all reasons why it would benefit to get rid of cars. It wouldnt kill you to walk a few blocks to work. by doing that you would be putting less stress on you and limiting the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
