dear school principal the thought on community service sickens me.

i mean don't get me wrong like im mean or something and don't want to help people but i don't think requiring this to students is a good idea.

i think this because it is taking time away from their free time. we already get enough work that is required to complete in school and that is taking enough time away from me. im trying to keep up with school and the sports i play. the only way this community service thing is going to work is if there is no work assigned and if we scheduled this during schooland not in our free time.

yes its great that people are helping our city, but to me this only shows how lazy people are.

look, if kids are taking time out of their day and choosing to clean up after others and not doing something that's a little more normal like watch tv or do school work so their ahead.

but no. their doing the most awkward thing i can think of clean up?! sense when has this been a priority to kids and teens?

this is changing society and giving another reminder that adults need to clean up because i can guarantee that the packs of cigarettes, beer and other waste on the side of the highway are mostly not products of children.

so why are they cleaning up this garbage instead of doing things that make childhood memorable like playing with friends and other things like that. ill tell you why its because some adults are not holding up their part of the deal.

so clean up after your self.

that's why i don't think community service should not be required. people need to learn a lesson especially the people that are apart of the problem.

thank you: STUDENT_NAME
