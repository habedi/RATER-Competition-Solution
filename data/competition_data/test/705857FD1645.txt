Dear Principal,

In my opinion, student should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. Students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch and free times because it can help them communicate with their parents and other peers.

Students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch because it could help them find their friends on the large school campus. Sometimes, when you don't know what class your friend has before lunch it is hard to finds them, and by having a cell phone you can call them and find them easily. Also, during lunch some students would want to call their parents to ask if they are bringing them a lunch, or if they should buy a school lunch. Students may also want to ask their parents if they can go to a friends house after school, and so they will not need to pick them up.

Having a cell phone would also help communication between students and friends from other schools, and between students and friends who are elsewhere on the campus. Students could call their friends to get help on homework or other school projects, or to plan what they are doing after school. Another reason why students should be able to have their cell phones on during free periods in school is because some students, if allowed, leave the campus to eat lunch, and their peers may be wondering where they are, when they are coming back, or to alert them that class has already started.

By not letting students have their cell phones in school, they would be unable to communicate with their parents or peers. The school staff may be worried that students may use their cell phones during class, but if students are allowed to use them in their free times they most likely will not use them while they are learning. Teachers are afraid that students secretly use their cell phones during class, and that it takes away from their education. However, if a student is caught using their cell phone during learning time they know it could be confiscated for the rest of the day.

Many students use their phones after school to contact their parents, friends, or carpool. Many times parents are late to pick their kids up, and if the kids have their cell phones they can call them to make sure they remember where they are. Students also use their cell phones after school to call their friends and ask if they want to hang out or go somewhere now that school ended.

In conclusion, students should be able to bring phones to school and only use them during lunch or other free periods, because it makes communicating easier. As long as cell phones are turned off and not used in class, they will not be a disturbance to the students learning and education.

Sincerely,
