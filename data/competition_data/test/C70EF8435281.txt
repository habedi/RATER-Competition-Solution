Students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to. They might not find sports, yearbooks, and student council fun. They could be playing sports outside of school and can't play on the school team or do other activities outside of school. What time frame would these activities start and end, some students might not be able to make it to those activities. If these activities start early some students might not have enough energy or be to tired to do these activities. Some students might not be able to make it to these activities or be to tired from school and just want to go home.

If students do not like these activities schools should have more options such as after school clubs, music, art. Students should also suggest ideas that they think is fun and would like to do. Students should have to sign up for these activities only if they know they will do them and have enough energy. The schools should also inform the students parents/guardians that they will be doing this activity. They should also send an email about what time the student should get picked up.

Some students may not want to do a sport because they might get bullied if they are not good enough for that team. Students may also feel bad about themselves if they make a bad play, pass, or shot. Students should have to tryout for sports and should report any bullying if they do not make the team. Other students should also not be rude to others who dont make the team either. Students should also play other sports outside of school if they do not make a team.

Students should not have to make year books because they can see others picture early and they could make fun of someone for having a bad picture in the year book. Some students also might find it boring and skip it. If students do this it should be during their flex or free time in school. Working on a year book might interfere with student's classes and they would have to do make up work if they are missing parts of a class. So instead students should just not do this and let teachers work on yearbooks.

So students should suggest ideas to teachers or their principle. Students should not bully others if they do not make a school team. Students should do other sports outside of school if they do not make a sports team. Teachers and staff should make year books. Students should also not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to.
