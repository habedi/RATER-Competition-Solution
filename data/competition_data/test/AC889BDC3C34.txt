Throughout the world countries are becoming more aware of the harmful effects of green house gases. This is evident in Bogota, Columbia an many other major Columbian cities. In Bogota there has been a car free day for the past three years. Even famous cities like Paris are getting into the act. There is a neighborhood in Germany where cars have become relatively extinct. These countries have figured out the advantages that come with limiting car usage.

The capital city of Bogota is the home to seven million people. One day a year the city goes "car-free". To make sure everyone follows this rule, violators are fined $25. The turnout for this event was large despite the gray clouds and occasional rain showers. This just shows how much people are willing to give up in order to save the environment.

In the smog filled streets of Paris, France a driving ban has been enforced. Due to days of near-record pollution, citizens with even numbered license plates were orderes to leave their car at home or face a 22-euro fine, which amounts to 31 U.S. dollars. This fine was then enforced the next day for vehicles with odd-numbered plates. This rule not only helped the environment it also led to congestion going down 60 percent.

Upon first look the german suburb of Vauban may seem normal, but upon closer inspection one might realize that there is a major difference. In this neighborhood cars are not used. Things like street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, there are only a few streets at the edge of one community, and only two parking garages for those who own cars. Vauban has been so succesful that other neighborhoods might try to model themselves after it.

To conclude, the limiting of car usage has been very succesful in other parts of the world. This ranges from France, to Germay, and even all the way to Columbia. People have been willing to give up their cars for several days, and for those in Vauban they've been willing to give up their cars for the rest of their lives. If these ideas were to spread throughout the world it would lead to cleaner air and a healthier environment.
