Dear Principal,

I am completely parallel to your idea of changing the school policy, which argues that students must have at least a B average to participate in activities. This idea will help students to become ambitious, responsible, and less likely to take things for granted.

While extra curricular activities are important, academics play a large role in the grand scheme of things. Most often, pupils seem to become comfortable with the idea that they can slack off in class as long as they are the star if a sports team. As much as sports are important, academics are what carry you through high school, college, a first job, and so on. Though a majority may not think of this, math and writing are used multitudes of time every day. Between getting morning coffee and emailing friends, these subjects play a vital role in each and every life of the student body. Succeeding in academics may be important, but motivation is needed to achieve such a thing.

School activities are most often taken for granted. Speaking from personal experience, the idea of not being able to participate in sports or extra curricular activities is a foreign concept. Though most may not be familiar with the idea of earning the right to be on school teams and such, it will be a wake up call.

Most students these days think that achieving above average grades is overrated, or do not think to attempt doing well at all. Sports and activities, on the other hand, are something people who are not as academically inclined usually prosper in. Having to earn good grades to enjoy these activities will motivate pupils to try their best.

In conclusion, sports and activities come second to education. Though participation in these activities are fun, academics are what get people through life. With the motivation to achieve academics, a pupil earns the right to join in sports teams and such. Forcing students to attain a B average will force students to come face to face with these truths.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
