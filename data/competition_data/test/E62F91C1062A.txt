Who really wants to wake up at 5am- 8am just to attend classes and learn about things that can be taught from the comfort of their own house. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home and still be able to learn what they need to just like they was at an actual school. Providing this option for the students is very beneficial. Distance learning will help students participate and be more involved in the learning process and their grades will improve.

In this generation the world revolves around mobile devices such as phones, IPad, and computers. Students feel more comfortable being on their devices rather then being around adults. Being able to attend online school by using mobile devices and not being around adults who push all this different types of information on to them is less stressful and more of a better experience for them. All of this will make students want to join the online classes or video conferencing. At my school we have this thing called Google classroom where teachers can basically give you notes or work for you to do which is all done online. I prefer doing my work on Google classroom and turning it in for a grade rather then doing it on physical paper and so does majority of the students at my school. Something about typing out the notes or just doing work on a mobile device is just a better alternative for students all together. I know some teachers can argue that actually writing out notes and being off your devices is one of the best ways for a student to receive and remember information. In some cases this might be true but as I said before this a generation where students have grown up with electronics; they are used to constantly being and doing things online. They are comfortable and more likely to actually do work if it is online. If you take that away from their and put paper and pencil in front of them that level of excitement or even motivation is gone and now the students will feel forced and not want to participate in school.

If students attend classes online their grades will improve. This is beneficial for the students who miss a day or absent from school for a long period of time. I know from personal experience that when I miss a day or two from school, my teachers always let me know what I have missed that day through Google classroom or even going a step further and putting the work in Google classroom so I can actually do it and be able to turn it in to receive full credit. Most students will miss days of school, come back, receive all their late work, and never do it; and not doing the work will result in a zero which end up lowering their grades. With online school they will be able to do the work the same day. I am also aware that a concern teachers might have is that students will be able to cheat to receive good grades on certain if attending classes online but regardless if the class was online or not, student will cheat no matter. That is an issue that teachers will always have to deal with no matter the setting of the classroom. To limit the use of cheating teachers can personally make the work, test or quizzes with questions and answers they know students won't be able to search up or limit the amount of Internet pages a student can get on while in the online class or video conference. This will all help the students to pay more attention in the lesson and push them to get a good grade knowing they can't cheat their way through the work.

Offering distance learning is a great idea. especially for the students and the teachers because at the end of the day all students want to do is pass their classes and all teachers want is for the students to pass their class. So why not make that easier or both of them? Not only will this help them pass their classes with a high grade but they will actually feel like they are learning the information in a better way. The traditional way of learning, through paper and pen is slowly but surly dying. Not because it was a bad method, but because each generation of students are learning a new and better method for them to learn and who are we to stop them from doing what's best for them? As long as they are actually being successful in school there's nothing to worry about.
