Would you like to be able to not drive you car or to drive your car. I would like to have driveless cars. Can you imagine the time that you get into to your car and the only thing you have to do is say car start. Well that where are cars are tranforming into we are starting to get cars that we don't have to drive the cars drive for us.

Driverless cars well also help the driver. In the text it say's " they still alert driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork accidents." So the driverless car well also let the driver know when to take over maunally by vibration of the seat. So the driver well always have to be aware of whats going on. driverless cars well also get you to where you're going in the shortest amount of time possible.

I think if we have self driving cars there wont be as many car crashes as there have been in the past couple of years. From people texting and driving or driving drunk or stuff like that. In paragragh 7 the text says'' They can steer ,accelerate , and brake themselves." So if the drivers are careless and not paying attiention to the road like there text or something the care can stop for them and not cause a crash.

Thats why i agree with the idea of a driverless car. I can see why some people wouldn't want a driverless car because what if the car crashes or something went wrong with it you might be the one responsible for the car crashing. So i can see why they might not want a driverless car. I think that driverless cars well be a good thing to have in 2020
