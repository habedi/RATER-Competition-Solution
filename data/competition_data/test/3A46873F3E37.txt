Some school offer distance learning as an option for student to attended classes from school sometimes will be a good option but everyone knows that it's hard do to be an home school, they might think it's the best but it is not they wont learn so much at home. Student will like that but it's bad because the wont learn so mach like everyone does in the school sitting down and just listen and ding a lot work. Some people think that it's great having that some they kid should be home all day and having fun, also they can do more stuff together and be there with the family, everyone think it's great having home school but it's not great. School should not distance learning as an option to attended classes from school to home because they wont learn so much as everyone does in the school with the teachers and because they wont get a lot trouble outside school, plus they don't get the full time to study like everyone does in school get full time and learn a lot for what is going on now in life and before.

Student should not pick have classes at home and not come to school because it's so bad, student can get more in trouble and will have a lot problems to go college why, because they did not come to school full time and learn more and be ready for college. However, they wont learn nothing in home like they will at school, school show you a lot stuff and learn so many stuff that every student will need it at the future there is gonna be a point they will need it. Why, because they can learn more, also can have a lot opportunity been school get so many scholarship and getting ready for the college themselves want to go want to show their parent and teacher that student can do it because thank s to them they push themselves to keep going no matter what. The best way to keep always great way is going to school full time and learn a lot with all those friends and teacher that will help you a lot with anything they need help on even they will check that they have great grade in school and they r doing amazing in every class and be nice with the teacher.

Student will not like to pick this option because it's the worse option they are gonna hear about, first think about it and then pick the best for themselves and be ready for school then college. No, because they might get in trouble outside school, plus they need full time in school to learn even more about it and be ready for anything and give all they got for the future. It's not the best option because they wont get a lot stuff in they head will be thinking so much and not pay attention when the teacher go to they house for 1 or 2 hours to teach will not be the same as school they will want to come back to school and be here for full time and have fun. Also everyone think it's the best to keep them home doing nothing just going out with them or their friend and might get in trouble because they might not doing everything right like they have to do every time no matter what is on the inside of their head .They will come back no matter what because will miss their friend and hang out with them and having a lot memories any where at school and be there making jokes with the teacher and everything they will miss because they don't have full time at school.

The best decision they will pick is not give and be allow to student pick classes or stay home and get a teacher for only 1 or 2 hours school will always pick the best for they own student because they want the best for every each one student always want the best for them no matter what even if their mean to them they always want the best and support them to. This are the best thing everyone can said and they will support their opinion because they dont want anyone out of school getting in trouble because they wont learn so much as everyone does in the school with the teachers and because they wont get a lot trouble outside school, plus they don't get the full time to study like everyone does in school get full time and learn a lot for what is going on now in life and before and the future.

The have to said always i am gonna be school everyday not skipping classes be ready to show parent and teacher that everyone can do it no matter what and show them that student are smart and make great decision for them life and be ready for the best future is waiting for them. A lot school been saying that they are the best option for them but it's not so they should not let any student take classes at home they need to be in school full time and get ready for anything that it's there and support them no matter.
