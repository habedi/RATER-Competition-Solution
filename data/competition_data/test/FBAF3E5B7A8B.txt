Are you on a long trip and brought snacks but cant reach them because there in the backseat? If you reach back there with a human driven car you're very likely to crash. I have a suggestion why not try a driverless car. Driverles cars can provide you with a way to get to things you need without worrying about crashing.

My position on driverless cars is their a great invention and need for society. I say this because it will cause less accidents from people trying to reach in the backseat to grab something they want.''Google cars have driven a million miles without a crash.

Have you ever dosed off while driving the smart car will allow you to catch a few z's and will alert you when something goes wrong on the road.''Google cars alert you when pulling in and out of driveways,navigating through roadwork,and dealing with road accidents. With the driverless car this will allow people to be more rested but still be alert when necassery.

Have you ever texted while driving or thought about texting while driving? Having a driverless car wil allow you to be hands free while in open road which will allow you to do the things you need to do.''In car system is actually a safety feature,and safety is a big concern.

For my conclusion I say you should pick up a driverless car because it can allow more things to be took care of. Also it would prevent texting and driving due to the in car sysem which displays things you need or messages you want to see.
