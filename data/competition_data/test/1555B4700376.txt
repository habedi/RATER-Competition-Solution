The author does a really good job with explaining in great detail as to why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. There are many dangers to this such as how hot and how unearth-like Venus really is today, but Venus used to be just like earth with many oceans and sea like creatures that we have on earth as well.

"Often referred to as Earth's "twin", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occassionally the closest in distance too." (paragraph 2) He then goes on to explain how Earth is sometimes "right around the corner" from Venus and because of this we have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus. Since no aircraft would be able to last over a few hours, no man has ever been in these spacecrafts that get sent there. Scientists are discussing further visits to Venus because they are fascinated with how much Venus used to be like Earth. "Long-ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth" *(paragraph 4). Scientists have discovered that to this day Venus still has many of thsoe earth-like features and are wondering if there is any form of life on this planet. Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters which makes the scientists think that man could probably try to take a trip to Venus in the years to come. Venus is so hot that it is one of the brightest points of the night sky which gives it the nickname "Evening Star" and it is really easy for stargazers to spot.

NASA is working on other ways of studing Venus such as silicon electronics that could withstand the 800 degree and 90 times greater atmospheric pressure that is on Venus. Studying Venus is very much so beneficial because it seems like there could be a great deal of life-like creatures on this planet within years to come.
