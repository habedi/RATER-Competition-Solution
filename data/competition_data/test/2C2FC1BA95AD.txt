Dear principal,

I believe that students should have a choice in whether or not to help people.

Forcing the students to do something isn't going to turn out well.

Some people will be glad to help others, and other people will hate the idea of it.

As a student myself,

I would prefer the freedom to do whatever I feel like doing.

I don't like it when I'm forced to do something I don't want to.

Community service is supposed to be voluntary.

Some clubs require community service to stay in them, and that's acceptable because you can quit out of the club if you don't want to do the service.

Some students will do everything they can to get out of doing service.

They will fake illnesses, complain that they were doing homework, and family issues are sometimes problems.

Other students will not do a good job because they are not focusing on the work.

Students will even fake doing the service because it sometimes isn't watched over by an adult.

I, personally, would be the student who does the service but does a bad job.

I don't want to go through the day looking forward to the afternoon and suddenly find out that I have to work for the city.

Community service is sometimes used as a punishment for a crime, and should not be imposed onto someone unless they willingly want to do it or they are paying for something.

Children want to play games, sports, and with friends.

They don't want time from that taken from them that they can keep.

I like to help people, but I help when I want to or someone forces me to.

The forced community service may also affect the school's reputation for better or for worse.

Parents may think it would be a great school because the school is involved with the community. Other parents might not want their child to go to the school because it is forcing service, and some parents may not have time to take them to and from the point of service.

Students will not want to go to the school because it means they have less free time.

Some students will do worse in school because they already take a lot of time to do homework, and with service lowering their time, they will probably not do the best they can.

I think helping others is the right thing to do, but it shouldn't be forced without a reasonable cause that doesn't involve just helping people.

Your choices affect more than you probably think.
