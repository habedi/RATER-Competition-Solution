Not all cowboys ride on horses, there are some special cowboys that ride waves. I am one of them ,I am Luke Bomberger a Seagoing Cowboy. When my friend Don Reist gave me this chance, I went for it and now I would like to give you the same chance that he gave me. Exploring this vast world, helping your country and others, and facing the sea with new friends by your side are all things we do.

This world is big and changing each day. You may not get to go to Greece or Venice on a regular day basis, but being a Seagoing Cowboy opens your eyes to the true beauty in the world. I have gone to Venice, The Acropolis in Greece and the Panama Canal on my way to China. Traveling the sea shows you beauty and it honors your country and others.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is no picnic, but it is a true service to your country and other countries as well. After World War II countries were in ruins and in need of supplies. Seagoing Cowboys meet their needs because we bring them animals they may need , food they need and so much more. We serve the 44 different countries that formed the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaion Administration). We not only serve our countries, we face the sea with new friends by our side.

The sea may come across as fish, beaches, sun, dolphins and fun, but it is actually much more dangerous than you may think.

When it was my first time for the nightwatch it was hard because it was raining, the deck was so slippery that I almost got knocked overboard,but the small metal strip kept me from from going of the edge. I was lucky to be alive, but I didn't work for a while because I cracked my ribs. This may all sound bad ,but the sea isn't all seasickness, sharks and cracked ribs either. We know how to have relax because after the supplies are dropped off we have some fun like; playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and more games helped us have fun on board our ship.

In conclusion, the sea is full of fun, pain, service, and exploration. I sincerly hope after this you choose to be a Seagoing Cowboy because that is one thing you will never forget. The chance of a life time, to be a cowboy who rode the waves.
