Dear Principal,

Me and some of my friends love sports but we have C' s in one of our classes could you make the policy say that only people with C' s or higher could join any sports? if you do change it some of the students that have C' s in one of their classes could enjoy playing sports. having them join sports would be like an extra class so they have to practice a lot and they might work a little harder at school so they can get their work done so they can practice a lot. if they get their work done then they will have higher grades in some classes. and if they get higher grades they will be able to get good jobs and become rich, and be successful at life. so if you would, please lower the grade requirement to at least C' s or higher?
