The author sugggests that studying venus is benifical to us and can lead to many great things. But getting on to the planet and studying it might be harder then even getting to it. They have not sent a manned space craft there because of hazorduas conditions. The conditions on the planets are terrible its hot, hard to see on, and has a high pressure. but hese are some of the challanges.

It has a thick atmosphere of amlost 97% carbon dioxide covering the whole planet. Even worse the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The planets tempature averages 800 degrees which is 90% greater then what we experince here on earth. Which is not even possible for any human to endour. Its environments pressure is so high it can crush a submerine that can stand even the deapest part of the ocean on earth. The environment is so strong it can liqufiy any metal that gose there. Lastly its impossible to see the land even from above where the tempatures and pressure is more bareable.

Even with all these conditions and challanges semming near impossible to live there is hope. There are materials being tested with promising outcomes and lasting 3 weeks in venus conditions test. Making planes that can stay above the clouds and be able to survive off solar power and have condition liveable. But in conclusion there are hopes and proof that one day we might be able to go to venus and research the planet and obtain meaning ful knowledge
