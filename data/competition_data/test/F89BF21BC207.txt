Driveless cars seem to be the next big invention people want to see. It seems like a great idea in general, but it would take a long time to get these cars approved and in a state where it would become the norm to own or use one. The money and time taken to develop these cars would be of better use elsewhere, these cars would cause unnecessary issues, and they also would endorse human laziness.

I do not think these cars should come to existence because of the time and money that they would take to develop. Even if they do use less fuel, the money that it takes to manufacture them is so great that I am sure their selling price would also be rather high, making it hard for common people to afford one. Only richer individuals would be able to afford these with ease. It just does not feel practical.

The passage also mentions issues that could arise between manufacturer and consumer. Where would the blame fall in the event that this new technology fails? Different laws and regulations would have to be created in order for these cars to be safe on the roads. Maybe the car will not know how to react to pedestrians and accidentally hits one and injures them. It would be hard to draw a line of who is to blame in those kinds of situations.

Lastly, I just do not like the idea. Because it endorses human laziness. Humans are already becoming more sedentary and technology is always being developed that makes human life "easier", but the tech just makes it worse. All of these devices make it so a lot of people do not eve. Have to leave their homes or do much of anything. People become obese and develop health issues, shortening the life span of humans and also putting babies at higher risks for health issues. The driverless car would be another one of these technologies that contributes to this laziness.

In conclusion, I do not believe that driverless cars should be technology that we should use in the future. Something like developing the most energy efficient car possible would be of better use. Driverless cars waste unnecessary money in development, would cause unnecessary issues, and endorse the already lazy behaviors of human beings.
