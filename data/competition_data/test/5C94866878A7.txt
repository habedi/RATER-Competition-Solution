Traveling beyong Earth shouldn't be be restricted by the the dangers and doubts, but should be thouroughly thought about, expanded on, and innovated on. Being bound by thoughts will lilmit our satisfacation of curiosities of humanity being met. Not only should we meet the challenge of travelling to Venus, but exceed at it.

NASA is working on mehcanical parts and electronics that will be resistent to the dense pressure, heat, and other forces of Venus's surface. NASA is also thinking of vehicles that will make it possible to withstand the hostile conditions of Venus. Though they may have limited insight of the on ground conditions, the scientist will be be able to study what they can. Although this may be a challenge to them, they are innovating everyday to allow our machines to withstand and last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

There are dangers along the way such as the extreme temperatures, the acidic atmosphere, and high pressure. But scientist are trying to make it possible for success of making equipment that will last through all of those hazords on Venus. Even with the problems along the way, scientist still work on ways to reach Venus beacuse it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago it most likely covered by oceans and was able to support life.

In conclusion, figuring out a way to reach and study Venus for a long time period is worth the risk of failure. We will learn from our mistakes and study the conditions of the planet more to make it possible to actaullly be able to study and retrieve results from the planet surface.
