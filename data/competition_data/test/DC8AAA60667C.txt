Isn't it crazy that technology has come so far that a computer can read a persons exact emotion right down to the exact calculation? Yes, there is now computer software that can read emotions, right down to the percent of each emotion. This software, created by Professor Thomas Huang and collaborated with Professor Nicu Sebe. This kind of technology should be known to everyone, especially kids in school.

This software knows every muscle in the face and understand the anatomy of these muscles. " Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huand relies on the work of psychlogists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facical Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated with each characteristic movoments of the facial muscles." This process can read every muscle in the face and link an emotion with the given expression. It can even identify mixed emotions by weighing different units. For a human, isn't always easy to read mixed emotions.

"In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day." Yes, humans read peoples faces on a day to day basis and can usually figure out the nonverbal emotion of a person, but for a person who doesn't know anatomy, this can be hard to place the exact emotion with the facical expression they are looking at. This software can even tell when a person is faking a smile, which again, isn't always easy for a human to pick up on. "its all about those muscular action units." Which, is very important for a kid to know.

Technology is all around people every day, and kids know how to work technology better than most other people; therefore, they should be taught this new software and understand it. This new technology can really do wonders " 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huand predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' " All kids learn in different ways, which can become a struggle for students. It isn't easy trying to learn when you just cannot understand it the way it is being taught to you, and this technology could completely change that. School could become way less stressful if it is being modified for each students understanding.

A lot of human communuication is nonverbal, with different signals and facial expressions humans make, its not always easy for a person to understand these nonverbal signals. Which, is why this technology could be revolutionary to kids in school.
