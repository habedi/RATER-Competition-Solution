I like the idea of this technology of how it can tell what peoples emotions are like. I belive it can help people who are wanting to in the feild of human emotions, because it can help them spot how a patient is feeling.

But this technology can also do harm to some people with depression because if or when they try the online face reader it is going to show that they are sad, mad, or angry and that might make them feel those emotions even more.

and here is my list of why I love and hate technology.

Modern technology has gotten to a point where if computers came alive the human race would be killed off in a couple of days.

Computers can now detect how we are feeling.

We have been able to make robots and who is to say that someone made falty wireing or made a falty chip.

There goes a robot on its way to making the world its own.

Technology is getting better every day with new computers and new updates to keep them safer to the user so they can worry less about their information getting out to the public.

That is Apples clam to fame that their phones and computers can not be hacked.

There are special employee's in Apple that try to hack their own system to make sure that their system is bulletproof.

This is why they were able to make this clam.

When new updates, phones, and computers come out there is a select few that try to find the weakest part of the system and tair it down.

Just to prove that no computer is better than them and their hacking system.

In fact now hacking systems are so good now that almost any computer can get hacked for the other side of the world.

Like the saying goes you are only as strong as your weakest link.

These are all reasons they computers are good and bad for people they can save use by keeping our information safe but they could also be hacked by some smart guy who has way to much time on his hands and then finally the world could be taken over by robots.

These are all reasons why I love and hate technology.
