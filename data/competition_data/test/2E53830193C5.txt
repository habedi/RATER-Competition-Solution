I think you should join and participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like helping others this would be a good thing for you to do. Why would u want to go? You would probably want to join because you get to help people affected by the World War II. You also ge to help out animals like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Who doesn't like that?

Many countries were left to ruins in Europe, so to help them the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of things. It was a big opportunity! One of the Seagoing Cowboys, Luke, said that he liked helping the animals on the ship. He loved taking care of the horses and young cows they had. He mentioned that he also enjoyed taking care of the people in need, it made him feel good! He also said he is really grateful he got to have the Oppurtunity of his lifetime!

If u would like to do any of these things I mentioned in this paragraph then being in the Seagoing Cowboys program would be perfect for you. But these are only a few reasons why you could or wanted to join.
