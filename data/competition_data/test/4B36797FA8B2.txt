Dear Principal,

I really don't think that either policy is great but if I had to choose one it would probably be Policy 1. I choose this one because Policy 2 says that they cannot have their phones at school at all, which might be a bad idea because what if there is a emergency and they have to call someone the entire school can't just use one phone for everybody. Now policy 1 says they can bring their phones but can only have them out during free times and off during class times. Now I think that policy 1 is probably the better idea because phones are a going to distract who ever has them and could get them in serious trouble. Now in policy 1 saying the can only have them out during free times they might take that as an option saying every time is a free time to them. So what if they do have their phones out, will there be consequences for it because if not they are going to have them out any way. You might want to reconsider the policy but it might remain the same from a student point of view.

So what will you as the principal do if they do have their phones out? You shouldn't give them any warnings because they should get they are old enough for it. You should put them on the spot and ask why do you have your phone out you know the school policy. This way they get the message that they aren't supposed to have it out till they are allowed. There is no reason for you to put it nicely because they are old enough to get it. This normally happens in a high school the lower schools don't have these problems as much they might have one or two but not the entire school.
