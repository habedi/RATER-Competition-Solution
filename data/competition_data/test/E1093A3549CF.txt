I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because they even had pictures that proved that is was a natural landform. Many people in the world had their own personal claims about the Face, but scientifically, it had been proven by pictures otherwise.

Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and captured pictures of the Face with a ten times better camera than the original Viking photos that were taken before. In the article, the text says, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." Even cameras caught the landform with pictures and proved it. The text also states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin." According to this piece of informational text from the article, the Face is a massive, natural landform, just like any landform here on Earth.

In this article, it has been proven by NASA and detailed pictures of the Facee, that it's just a natural landform that just so happened to look like a human face. Even though some had their own thoughts and opinions, scientifically, they were wrong.
