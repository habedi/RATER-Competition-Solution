If the face was created by aliens then their would be a civilization on the planet long before. Even if that could be really thrilling that ,however, is not true. The Face that is on Mars is a mesa because reaserch and pictures where analized, it matches to our natural landforms, and their are multipule in Cydonia. Each of these prove that it is not made by aliens, as cool as that would be. If we go more into depth we will talk about the pictures and research, our landforms, and the multipule in Cydonia.

First off, The face on Mars is a mesa ,thanks to the pictures that where analized. It could also pose as a butte like the one in Snake River Plain of Idaho. The text states that, "What each picture actually shows is the martian equivalent to a mesa or buttle." (12) It just shows how much just one picture can prove.

Second, This looks like just another one of our landforms. Like I had said before it is like the Middle butte in Snake River Plain. In the text it states that , "Thousands of web surfers waiting when the image was revealed on the JPL wedsite, appearing... a natural landform." (7) If thousands of people had saw a landform appear how do you not see that it is like the ones on Earth.

Finally, in Cydonia their are already multiple mesas. The only difference is that this one is more face like. The articale says, " It was just another Martian mesa, common aruond Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows around it."(2) If NASA had done research to see about other laandforms and they have proven that their are more than one on the plane, then it must be true.

Most people say, "The face is bona fide evidence on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide." (5) However why would NASA want to ruin their entire budget by saying that their was a civilization on Mars to begin with. So these three points, landforms, pictures, and the multiple mesas, should show that The Face really is not a martian creation.
