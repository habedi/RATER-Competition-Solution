I believe that students can benefit from attending classes at home. Many students have a safer learning environment when learning at home than at schools. Since majority of students have access to the internet and have computers at home, connecting to online classes wouldn't be an issue. Most students have a hard time waking up early in the morning; if they were to take online classes, students would be able to get more sleep and be able to focus easier. Students can benefit from online learning because they have a more comfortable learning environment and a less stressful schedule.

My first reason to why students would benefit from online classes, is that they have a more comfortable environment.Â Students can work in their pajamas while doing online assignments, however, if they are in a video conference with a teacher, they must be dressed somewhat appropriate. Being at home can help students be more focused on their work and do much better on assignments. Students will avoid distracting classmates and getting in trouble with their friends when at home. For example, whenever students see their friends, they immediately want to talk and joke around with them, which could lead to them getting in trouble with the teacher. Unfortunately, some students have to deal with classmates that bullies and discourages them, but they wouldn't have to deal with them if they are at home. If students took classes online at home, all these reasons could improve a student's education.

My second reason why students could improve their education through online classes is that they would have a less stressful schedule. Most students like to sleep in, but as long as they complete their assignments the same day, students can sleep for as long as they want. For example, students who attend schools have to a wake up from around 5am to 6am to be on time for school; while students who take online classes can wake up on their own time. Since students don't have to arrive at school; they do not have to worry about missing the bus or be ready when someone to comes pick them up. Most importantly, students may eat meals and snacks whenever they would like and not have to follow their school's lunch schedule. However, students must make sure their computer is charged so they can complete their all assignments.

In conclusion, there are many positive outcomes from attending classes at home than at school. It can be easier for students to focus, they don't have to worry about other students, they can work in pajamas, students can wake up later on, students don't have to worry about missing the bus, and students may eat whenever they like. All of these reasons help prove that students may receive greater benefits from online classes at home.
