Technology should be allowed to read other student's emotions. It is a wise way to help the student and also help the teacher if he or she knows how the student is feeling in their classroom. It is a brand new use of technology. It is also a new, useful, and entertaing way to use technology.

First, if a computer can read a sudent's emotions, then it can allow the teacher to know if that student is doing well of not. Dr. Huang, a professor at University of Illinois, states that "A classroom computer could recognize when as tudent is becoming confused or bored" he then continues his statement with "then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" This will help students to better understand the subject that they would've had trouble with if the teacher didn't know how the student felt.

One may argue that there are other ways for the teacher to help the student; like extra help after school or the student can ask the teacher for clarification on the topic. Dr. Huang describes that "most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. In modern days; people, especially students, don't feel comftorable with expressing their emotions. Which is why we should have a way to help all students succeed in school.

Second, being able to find out others emotions would be entertaining. A popular item several years ago was the mood color ring. When the ring would come in contact with your skin, it would change colors based off your hand tempeture. The colors would match up with a key that told you what colors meant which. For example, red would mean angry and yellow would mean happy and purple meant sad. The idea of technology being able to state your feelings is just an advanced mood ring. There are other reasons that this idea would be entertaining. It's an annoyance t have web browser ads that aren't interesting to you, but ads that do interest you are kind of nice to have. If your computer can read your expressions while seeing these ads, it can show ads that would possibly interest you.

An argument could be that it's an invasion of privacy. The computer isn't reading you mind or stating you thoughts. The computer is just being helpful with what happens on its screen.

Finally, the ability to read one's emotions with a computer is a brand new and special use of technology. The way it works is descibed in paragraph 2 where "the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles" after this, Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) "classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles" That is amazing! Dr. Eckman created a way for technology to scan the many muscles of a human face and classify them with a variety of six emotions. This is a revolutionary new advancment in technology.

In conclusion, it is helpful for a computer to read your emotions. It's a fun way just to mess around and interact with friends. It also has educational purposes to allow the teacher to discover ways to be helpful to all of his or her students. And it's a large advancment in technology.
