Dear Principal,

Well I noticed that you have been deciding whether to make students do community service or just to keep it as an option. In my opinion, it think you should make it mandatory for students to do community service. I know that some kids have other after school activities, and others don't. So I think the ones who just go home after school and just do homework should do community service. All they're going to do at home is sit down and watch television, play video games, or go on the computer.

All the students that don't play after school sports or any other activities should do at least five hours of community service in a school week. This will help the kids be more active and want to play sports. The kids probably wouldn't want to do community service will maybe start playing sports. The kids who do want to do community service will be helping out the community.

Hopefully this letter will help you with your decision that you have to make.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
