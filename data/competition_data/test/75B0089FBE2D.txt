It should be able to be used in the classroom because, people like themselves or the teacher should know how they are feeling today or want to know how they are feeling on certrain days, and what emotions they aren having. It also can be used in science so we should be able to learn this especially sincewe all have emotions and why not spice science up since we do have a science class. It can help us learn more about emotions and how can we actually can tell how we are really feeling. I think we should also have them because it said in paragraph 6 "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", and I think that will help us cause the teachers can then see we need help trying to understand or need to take breaks becuase we have became bored and or confuse. I also would love to use this to find out how my friends emotions are on a certain day because I wouldnt want to bother them if they are angry or sad. I would also use it for my teacher. I think it would be fun to use in school and it would actually catch the children atttention in school. In my opinion this would be great becuase just like they used it on the Mona Lisa picture we can use it on many other pictures and find out alot more and how people emotions were. I know i would love to use them on slavery pictures.
