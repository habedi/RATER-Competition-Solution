Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Instead of eliminating the use of cell phones at school, I think you should enforce Policy 1 and make a few adjustments. If you we're too allow students too use they're cell phones during lunch and the time they spend in the hallway it would not be only good for the students, it'd be good for you as well. One way it'd be good for you is, their would be less parents coming in and getting students cell phones that have been taken away because they didn't have any free time too text.

I know your thinking "The students will still text when they aren't supposed to." well that's were we make the adjustments. Considering students love to text, their will be some students who will take it upon themselves too text during class even though they just had a break to use their phones. So teachers should enforce them too turn them off and put them away. If they ignore that rule then they should get a warning the first time, a cell phone break suspension the second, then loose the privilege too text at school the third time for that quarter.

I think this method would work. As a student I like to text and if I had the opportunity to do it at school without getting in trouble I would take it. Also if a student gets a discipline referral for a different offense they should get their texting rights suspended, Then students would purposely behave so they can keep their phone break.

If you chose Policy 2 then more students will text in class, get their phones taken away and you will get many visits from parents. So why not do it the easy way, let students use their phones during their free time and if they disobey then take that privilege away from them. As easy as that, good behavior deserves a reward doesn't it? So I would appreciate it if you considered trying it out if you don't like it change I respect your discio

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
