So when Luke came back to China he saw even more homeless people than before. So he thought he would have to make a change to that.

So when he was setting up a program for conviencing people to help the homeless Don tried to call and have him come to America and and Luke said, "Don, I can't I have to help the people in China because I see little kids and grown people starving on the street and that hurts me." So then when he had it set up a lot of people came to support it and Luke convienced a lot of people, but also a lot of people not to help. So the applications to sign up there was a fee of ten dollars to help with the grocceries and that was why even more people did not join him.

So when he saw a lot of people without forms he stopped everybody and had a long speech about helping the poor and imagine if you were in their shoes and telling them they didn't want to be like that. So then almost all the people clapped and then walked in and got a form and asked him where to start. He said," Just if you see a homeless person, help him out. So then after he rode his boat to America and helped Don out he came back to China to see how his SeaGoing Cowboys program was going.

When he came to China he was very happy of how everybody had a house and job and nobody was starving. So he set up a meeting and thanked everybody who supported that program and told them they did a wonderful job and he almost cired of how much he was happy.

So when he rode his boat back to his home town he told Don and Luke's family about what happened and they said they should do that in America and they did and it worked out just as great as China. His program became national because how good it was and he said it was all the people who helped out he said, "What I love about it was that they didn't have to do but how they did, it just makes me warm inside and very happy." So just seeing homeless people on the street made and making a program had this much of a bennifit. Luke felted great about what he did.
