Dear Principle,

I think its good that your not letting the kids in your school participate in sports and activities. I strongly agree that kids shouldn't participate in activities if they don't have an A, B, or C grade point average. I think that if kids don't have above a C grade average they shouldn't be able to do fun activities because Kids need to know that it is way more important to get an education because when you make it all the way to High School and you graduate, you will be able to get a job and succeed at anything you are working for. If you do your work now in school if will be more easier to pass more in life knowing that you tried hard and you got a good education. Also if these kids cared more about there work and less about doing whatever they want, they will get somewhere in life.

That's why i strongly believe that kids should be able to participate in activities if they have higher that a c grade point average. If kids don't have good grade, but they do want to participate in sports they would have to work hard and try there best. So now that now you know that i understand what your saying. Kids in school should have discipline if they are to lazy and don't want to do there work.

also think that they should be disciplined if they refuse to listen to there teachers and refuse to participate in classroom activities.

I do think that if kids don't care about school that in life it will be more hard to find a job because if you make it from Elementary all the way to High School, You will most likely get hired. People these days are looking for someone that had a good education and that is qualified to do any task that is thrown at them.

I do understand what you are trying to do in school with the students. You are trying to get them to work hard in school so that when they grow up and become an adult they will be determined to go to work and do there job . Also that they will be determined to succeed in life.
