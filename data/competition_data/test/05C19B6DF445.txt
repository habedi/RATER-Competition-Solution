I don't think that is a right thing to do on our benefit because we try. We as children or teens do our best hoping that you will accept it... but our best is not enough? students have a grade C and cant participate in school activities I don't think that's a way to run a elementary school. I don't think the school policy should change.

If students don't have daily activities like sports and things how do you expect them to be physical and active during class. With out activities how are students going to stay in shape. their are more reasons to support this. Like students cant have physical education and they cant have any sports team. What parent would want to send their child to a school like that.

The students need time that's all. The principal of the school needs to have patience with the students of that school. If you were to give it some time then maybe the grades will go up even higher then expected. Children of our age group work at their own paste so give them a chance. Don't take away the school activities and the grades will get better.

In conclusion, it is not the right thing to do if you decide to take it away. Different school are getting better because of patience. Also some schools are getting worse because teachers and principals are being hard on the students. Don't take the activities away it would work in the beginning but in the end it will be a mess.
