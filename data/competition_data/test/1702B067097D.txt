Have you ever wondered what life today would be like if insted of driving a car you walked or took transits? So People believe that if people in citys drove cars less and walked or biked more that it would drasticly lower the amount of greenhouse gases in the air.

Some citys are setting examples of less use of cars and more walking have lowered polution. Paris, France for example had issued a new lay stating that on certain day people with even-numbered licence plates were not permited to drive a car and vic versa. Studys have shown that The smog levels in the city (which are usualy high) was lower than usual. Some people were angry whit this law and drove anyways, but anyone caught had to pay a 22-euro fine ($31). Some people also said that it's not the regular gasoline cars that were causing all the smog, it was the big diesel trucks. 67 percent of vehicles in france do use diesel fuel, but the normal gasoline car still contribute enought to be put off the streets.

Another city that is also trying to get cars off the street is BOGOTA, Colombia. They started an new event called They days without cars campaign. The reason for this was to lower the amount of smog and occational dark grey clouds that droped acid rain. The effect of this campaign has spread to nearby citys in the region. The campaign has been in effect since the 1990s. parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city and rush-hour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic.

President Obama abitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emmissions have been set, but americans are lowering the use of car by themselves. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the year goes by. Most studys have show one of the main reasons for this decline is because cashed-strapped Americans cant affored new car, and the unemplyed were't going to work anyway.

These are just a few ways people are lowering the use of fossile fuels. By setting up these campaigns, the use of fossile fuels will be greatly reduced
