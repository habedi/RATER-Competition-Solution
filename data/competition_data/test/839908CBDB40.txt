Dear Principal,

I think students should perform in Community Service because they could be changing the world... They could be making a good difference in this planet.. they well be making the earth healthy, the air well be more cleaner than it is, there wouldn't be anymore trash in the parks, ocean, streets, and in the grounds. Oh n i think that be in the community wouldn't be wasting your time.. it would actually would be fun because you could be meeting new people. you would be making a good thing in your life. students well be proud of them doing some difference in the earth.. well i think ? but still if i would be pro forming in the community service i would have been proud of my self, because am be making a bid difference in this planet. I my opinion i think it would be fun cause you'll be picking stuff were u had never been before.. Like if u go to a park and start picking trash you could be making the plants healthy and you'll be getting your hands all dirty your cloth and i think that is fun. Students should be doing community service because it could keep away from doing bad stuff..
