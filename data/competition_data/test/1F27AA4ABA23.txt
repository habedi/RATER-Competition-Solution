Join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can experience different adventures from all around the world.

Body#1: In the program, you can experience different countries and adventures from all around the world. You can also visit places you have not been to before. After you come back home, it can make you more aware of people in different countries.

In the program, you go from country to country delivering horses, mules, supplies and also sometimes food. Joining this program is very helpful to the citizens/people living in these countries because of World War II.

Although, joining this program can sometimes be very dangerous. From high waves and huge thunderstorms, to slipping overboard and getting very wet and ice-cold. Sometimes, you are elected to be a night watchman and check on the animals hourly, but just be careful about where you step because you might slip and fall down the side of the ship.

Now that I've told you everything about the program, who wants to join?
