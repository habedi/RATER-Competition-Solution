I believe that the grade average for doing sports and after school activites should be changed to a B average for many reasons. If students do not do well in class, why should they be allowed to play sports and other activities when school work in more important. In other cases, I enjoy doing sports and such, but sometimes slip into a C average and need to bring my grad back up. Sports and after school actives are fun and helps students make new friends with the same interests and the activities students can join are enjoyable to the all kids who join them. Sports are good endurance builders, are good exercise can help some kids from becoming obese. There are many reasons why they are good for students.

Even though there are many good things about after school sports and activities, kids need to go to school and get an education. Getting an education helps a person become more well rounded and lets them experience new things that will help them later in life. Almost any job has math to do with it and you need math to understand bills, taxes and other things. sscience is every where in so many jobs, including sports and being a hair dresser. People need to learn things in order to succeed in life, that's why we have schools. Going to school also helps a interact with other people and improve people skills. Its important to know things to live a good life.

There is one thing I think is important for everyone think of before choosing to do, or not do, after school sports and actives, do you benefit from it? The answer is yes, you do. If your doing a sport or activity, you are doing what you love, and who does not want good grades? It makes your parents happy, you teachers happy, and it feels good to be a smart person. Doing both is good for you and will help you later in life. Having good grades and doing sports is a good way to get scholarships for good collages. If everyone who had a B average and did sports or acivies, we would have a world full of smart interesting people.
