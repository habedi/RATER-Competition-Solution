Dear TEACHER_NAME,

January 26th, 2011

I believe that you should make community service required in our school. You should make community service required because it shows kids to be thankful for what they have, makes them get into real life situations, and a kid can't take one hour a week to help in their community? Community service makes kids think different in every day situations like should i bully some kid that has no parents or should i give him a complement?

When i downtown to the animal shelter to volunteer i feel good and thankful for what i have. I feel that if kids do community service it shows them "wow i have a lot, thanks mom and dad!" kids fight with people everyday over what they wear, how they look, what they say. We are all lucky if we can walk, have a roof over our heads, have someone their to support you, have clean water. People across the world can afford food everyday. Here in America we should be thankful for what we have!

When we are older we are going to deal with getting a house, buying food, making money; real life things. If we don't know what is ahead we are not going to know how to handle things. If we can just help out in our community like real young adults we are going to have a better way of living to know what happens ahead of childhood.

If you are a kid you play games, computer, and watch Television some people can't even afford a television. If we can't use one hour a week to go and help our community and sit down and sleep, that's bad! we have hours and hours of saying I'm bored. Well go help the community! In America we can be better people everyday, why not make it better by making community service mandatory.

I think if you want America to be a better place then it would really help to make Community service mandatory just to make people stop complaining. You are living that's all that matters, your trying your hardest to make life better. Maybe we should try to make some ones life better.

Thanks,
