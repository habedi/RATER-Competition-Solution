The Facial Action Coding Systen is valuable in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in the classroom because there are students who fake a smile when they're sad or troubled. Some students want help but they don't want to bother people with their problems so they stay quiet and fake a smile. With FACS the teachers and students will be able to tell the student's emotions and they can help the student.

It is also helpful because it can tell when a student is bored. When a student is bored, he/she will most likely not pay attention. But with FACS teachers will be able to tell when the student is bored so they can make learning a little fun. That way students will be able to pay attention and get educated.

Also, FACS can tell when the student is scared. The students might be going through something and they're scared of someone or something but some students don't know how to tell. They could be threatened by someone. FACS will be able to tell when the student is scared so the teachers and students can finally help the student who is scared.
