for me i can say many student they can't,not do what they told to do if they school say all student will start learn at home,with they chrombook but few can do they work and i think it will be parents jobs to make they childs to do they work because student can benefit to do work online beause he have his cellphone or video game or he like to atch netflix, at that time and teacher send the work at his chrombook the student will not let to watch movies or game or see what is going on in his phone he will say i will they work after or tomorrow, then tomorrow teacher send another work he do the same things in 2 days that mean the students did not do any works for 2 days he get zero on those class, but when his parent ask him are doing your works students will say i'm doing them, and parents will trust him and say ok because parants they all a lots of things to fucus on they will just ask they childs, and the childs will say yes, but for me i can say if they school decide to do that first thing they need to contact with students parent or send a email to them and let them know that when they school work will be send and how long the want taht works to be return to the teacher, if the parents know that they will know when they works will be in they childs chrombook and how long the works need to be finished so teacher or school they can say how different if they works with students parents at this idea, but if they just say all student will start do your works at online if not parents know any informatoin students will end up not know anything or study what they need to study, because some students even at school they don't want to they works and they have help from teacher but they still skips class or fall sleep during works even on the testing time they fall sleeps or just think you send them home to start do the works or study at home some of students they will not even touch chrombook or do any works, and other things that will make students boring is when the video is playing example if the videos is 3 to 5 minutes students will use his phone because the video his playing then students will not fucus on works or thhe video that his playing in his screen, but students will fucus on what his seeing in his phone or table or other devices that, students they have a groups chats when they start chats they will stops the video or works then they sart chating in groups with friends, they things that they have time, to finished but they don't when other works send they will do sme things and that is problem, and some of student love to play game and some student they don't have phone they use school chrombook to play gams on it, but if school block everything int those chrombook some students they can fucus on the works as wellÂ
