Dear My Principal!,

I agree with you that students should have at least a B in all core classes if they want to participate in any sports.

Students should not be involved in this case because if we let them do it now then the students will think its all right to fail their classes.

If we discipline them then it will encourage students to do well in their classes.

If we don't make this policy than the parents of the children might think we don't care about their education.

Many parents may take their kids out of our school because were not giving a good education.

With all the C average students and failing students the school might be one of the worse schools in the state maybe even the country.

Being one of the worse schools is bad because you will not get any more students the following year.

It is also bad because our school could be the only school a child can come to and they cant get their education.

I think in every school that should be the case so none of these things can happen.

No matter how bad the kids pout or what they say they should not be able to play any sports or do any activities without at least a B.

You should tell your students that even though your mad right now about this, one day they will thank me for it.

Sincerely, A concerned student STUDENT_NAME
