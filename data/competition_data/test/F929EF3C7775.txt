Do you think the Face on Mars is a natural landform or it was created by aliens? I am almost completely positive that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. There are scientifically proven facts that the Face is a natural landform. The Face was first spotted and taken a picture of by NASA's spacecraft Viking 1 in 1976. Ever since then people have been curious to find out more and more about this discovery. It is proven that the Face is a mesa. The Face only looks like a face because shadows creates the appearance of facial features.

The Face is proven by NASA that it is only a mesa. The article states "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..." This shows how there are other mesas and they are known for being in the same area as the Face. This is not the only example that the Face is a natural landform, the Face doesnt even have actual feautures of a human face.

There is also proof that the Face does not have the structure of a human face. The article states NASA captioned a image of the Face stating "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth." This proves that shadows make the appearance of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, the Face does not have the structure of these facial features. NASA has proved and showed many reasons of why the Face was not created by aliens.

The Face was not created by aliens and NASA has proved it. The Face has shadows that makes it appeare like it has an actual facial structure. The face is just another mesa that is common is its area. I believe people should except the fact and believe the Face was not created by aliens.
