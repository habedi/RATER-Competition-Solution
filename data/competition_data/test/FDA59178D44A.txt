The planet called " Earth Twin" is called Venus. Venus is the most alike planet to earth density and size. Another name for Venus is the "Evening star" because not only its the closest to look liike eath density ans size it also the closest planet to earth. So at night you can look you and see Venus. Venus even had some space craft send to the planet but noe of the survived the landing on the planet over three decades.

This planet surface and atomspher both have extream conditons. The atomspher of venus is 97 percent carbor doxide and the clouds rain corrosive surface acid. And the surface is over 800 degrees fahreheit and the peressure is 90 time than earth. Even thought Mercury is closter to the sun Venus has the hottest surface. And thats because of the weather patters and the voclanos. Or it because the powerful earth quakes or the lighting strike.

The NASA want to still try to send thing to this planet it lear thing they cant touch. They know the probly they have to solve before they really send anything up there. There was people in the 1800s trying to figur out Venus mistorys and people even going over that to see if they miss anything. Alot of researchers was trying to past the challenge but didnt know how because the heat of the planet was messing upthe rocket they was sending and there tryinh to fiuger out that problem now.
