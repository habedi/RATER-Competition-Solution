Policy 1:

Hi, I am a teenage girl named STUDENT_NAME that goes to SCHOOL_NAME, and my principal named TEACHER_NAME, is allowing the students to have their cell phones at school.

There is only one place that they can not have them, during class.

She would always catch some of my friends during class using their cell phones and would give them detentions, so the kids made a riot against her.

TEACHER_NAME does not want to be uncool and banish the cell phones, so she is being nice, and letting them use them out side of class.

Ever since she enhanced that rule, the student have been ignoring each other and starting fights because they want to use each other's cell phones.

Luckily, I don't have a phone, or friends.

Policy 2:

Hey, it's me again, STUDENT_NAME, and my Principal took the cell phone rule away.

The students are being rude to her and asking things like, " why can't we have our cell phones during class if we can have them at lunch?"

We'll that's why I'm going to send her a letter give her my opinion on the rule.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand your concern on the cell phones rule, and I would like to inform you that I agree with you.

This is a high school and the students, including me, should not be allowed to use cell phones during any time in school.

If, some how, all the students will hate you after this decision, it's better for them because they will get an education and grow up to be strong and smart, but if they do actually hate you, you should be proud of yourself because you are creating smart teenagers all by yourself. Thank you for reading my letter about the cell phone rules.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
