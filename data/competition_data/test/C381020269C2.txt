Dear Principal,

I have heard your idea so only kids with a grade B average. I do not agree with you, I think if you make it a policy there will be no sports teams. Kids could get mad at the school and drop out or change schools. It could affect there learning. They can be really good at a sport but can't play because of this policy. It can affect there life in the future by making them not want to play a sport when there good at that sport and they had a bright future in front of them. You might it will help but I don't think that will help because it matters how much dedication you put it to something, not if your forced to do well to play a sport. Another reason is that sports are healthy and if there not allowed to play sports they go out of weight. Be less healthy and then we would have a serious problem. As you can see I don't want this policy because it can affect kids life. My call to action would be that this policy not be put in action.
