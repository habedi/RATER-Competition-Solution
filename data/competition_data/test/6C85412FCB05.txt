The Face found on May 24, 2001 is formed by a natural landform. At the begninng of the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars" it states, New high-resolution images and 3D altimertry from NASA's Mars Global Survery spacecarrt reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa. This sentece is telling the reader the truth right then and there. The face infact is formed by a natural landform, a mesa which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 2 it tells us, the readers, that scientists figured the face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia but only had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. In paragraph 8 it gives a reasonn on why maybe the alien markings showed up on the face. The camera that took the photograph of the face had to peer through a wispy cloud to see the face. Perhaps the alien figures had been caused by the cloudy surface. In paragraph 6 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, " We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it." Jim was still trying to get the truth to the people after 18 years long of the Viking mission ended. Althoug targeting Cydonia was not easy, on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team from Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia flew and took a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. Soon the image showed up on a JPL wed site, revealing what the truth was a natural landform that caused the face to appear on Mars.
