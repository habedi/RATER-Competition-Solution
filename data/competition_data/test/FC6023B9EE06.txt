The new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sysytem that enables computers to identitfy human emotions is a geat idea. I am all for the new technology. I plenty of reasons why.

One reason the new technology is a good idea is so you can tell wheather a child is bored or no in school. In the text it states,'' A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr Huang predicts. Also in the text is states,'' The same technology can make a computer-animated faces more expressive for video games and video surgey.

Second reason the technology is a good idea is because the computer can can tell how your feeling one day and how your feeling the next day. In the text it states,'' The computer has six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Also in the text it states,'' For example , your frontails pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. The technology system has diffrent emotions.

Finally a third reason why the technology is a good idea is because it helps produce your face expressions. In the text it states,'' According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emtion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. For example; coach Constantin stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

The new technology is a great idea because One it can tell wheather a child is confused or bored, Two the technology can tell what face expression and how your feeling one day or the next, and finally Three the new technology helps produce your face expressions.
