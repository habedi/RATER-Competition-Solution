The article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is an article that talks about the idea of exploring Venus. In the article, it mentions a plethora of challenges that come along with exploring Venus. The challenges include such things as: 97% carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of highly corrosive sulphuric acid, atmospheric pressure greater than that of Earth, and many other things. However, the author still thinks it is a great idea to explore Earth's sister planet. I happen to be one of the few, or many, individuals who think he supports his ideas very well.

Although Venus is not the safest place to explore, the author points out ways in which it can be done. He mentions NASA's idea of allowing humans to float above the fray as a way to see what is on Venus. When he says "above the fray", he is saying is that we could just place a blimp-like vehicle that hovers about 30 miles above Venus's treachorous landscape. This could work because as the author mentions, jet airplanes fly at a higher altitude in order to avoid dangerous storms. Storms that could knock them out of the sky and send them crashing to the ground.

The author also points out some interesting caveats that might prevent us from doing anything scientifically productive. They mention how just simply floating above Venus only allows us to see only a limited amount of stuff on the planet. This would be due to the conditions on the planet, such as the atmosphere being too dense to allow light to penetrate it. They also mention how researchers would be incapable of taking samples of things like rock or gas.

Luckily, scientists are working on innovations, possibly groundbreaking, that can help achieve an actually productive exploration of Venus. One such innovation is a simplified electronic that is made of silicon carbide. This is put to test in a chamber that simulates the conditions on Venus. The researchers are also looking back to old mechanical computers, which aren't a whole lot like the computers we have today and are more resistant to extreme conditions. Unlike our computers, these compuers make calculations using gears and levers.

In conclusion, the author supported his claim well that we can explore Venus despite its dangerous atmosphere. They rightfully point out good technologies that can be used to circumvent the atmospere and still be able to have a productive exploration. An example of such is the old mechanical computer.
