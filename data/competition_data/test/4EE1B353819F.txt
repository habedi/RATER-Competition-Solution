Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think policy one is better. Which is to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them when they have free time. I agree with this policy for many reasons. I think its both fair to the students and the school staff. As for the other policy, policy two, I'm going to have to disagree with that policy. There is no point in making that policy anyways because, students are still going to bring cell phones to school even though there asked not to. So I would, and most of my fellow students will also agree with policy one.

One reason why policy one is better is because students need cell phones. For emergency's and other use. And if you try to make cell phones banned from school it will anger both parents and students. Some students need it to stay in contact with their parents and others need it for music, texting etc.

Policy one states that cell phones can be used during lunch and free time. It's very disrespectful to text or call someone in class while the teachers are trying to teach, but policy one says that cell phones can't be used during class time. And I'm sure that if students get to use their phone during school hours while they have free time is more than enough which will prevent them from using it during class.

Over all, I think that's its best to enforce policy one. I would rather to use my cell phone during lunch or free time but not using it at all is very uncomfortable. And I'm sure students will respect that policy more than policy two.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
