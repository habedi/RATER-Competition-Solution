Cell Phones were invented in 1973, however, they weren't owned by the public until the 80s. Phone usage grew quickly after the first two decades, and now over half of the world population owns a phone. Considering cell phones haven't been around for a long time, they have become a main part of our lives, and we rely on them for simple daily activities. The growth of cell phones could be from how easy it is to reach someone within seconds no matter their location. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: phone calls, sending text messages, emails, surfing the internet, and performing other tasks. But unfortunately, many of these daily activities also occur while a person is driving. As a result, there's an increase in accidents and fatalities because of the use of cell phones while driving. Cell phone usage while driving should be banned because it's a distraction, causes erratic and aggressive driving, and is the main cause of accidents.

While driving, total concentration and procedures are needed, and using a cell phone compromises the focus needed. When driving both hands should be kept on the steering wheel because it has been proving more effective. However, when you're on the phone you don't have both hard on the wheel. Even though some people use bluetooth headsets it still affects your attentiveness. Using a phone while driving causes drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, their minds off the road and the surrounding situation, and take their eyes off the road.

When driving you shouldn't have any distractions such as cell phones, because they can cause a change to your driving pattern.

Because using a cell phone while driving is such a distraction, it can cause the driver to drive erratically. Being on the phone may cause the driver to fail to give the right signals, miss road signs, or respond slowly to situations. These patterns can be very treacherous to others driving and pedestrians. Cell phones can also change the drivers' behavior depending on the conversation or what the driver is doing on their phone. Drivers experiencing emotional or stressful conversations may behave more aggressively, possibly causing road rage and accidents. Even though most drivers believe they can multitask, many of them are getting distracted and their driving patterns are changing, causing them to have accidents.

Many accidents are caused by those using their cell phones while driving. There are about 1.6 million accidents caused by phone use, which is roughly six times more than accidents caused by drunk drivers. In 2011, it was reported that 23% of all car accidents each year involve cell phone use. The National Safety Council reports that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the

U.S. is caused by drivers using cell phones. Leaving about 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by being on the phone while driving. Cell phone use causes many accidents because of the distractions it causes and should be illegal to use while driving.

Cell phones have quickly spread and became a major part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything, making us rely on them heavily. However, we are using phones while driving, which is causing an increase in accidents. Phones cause distractions and could change the behavior of the driver. Because of cell phones being used while driving there have been about 390,000 injuries each year. Therefore, we should ban drivers from being able to use their cell phones.
