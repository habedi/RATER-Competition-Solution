Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that many students should perform community service. Though some may be busy with other requirements it's always good to help out. I am all for you making students do this for many reasons.

Personally I would perform community service if you asked me too. Yet, I know many students who are not able to. For example sports, they play a big part in some of their lives. I know that they play a huge part in mine. Also sports require good grades and lots of work, that may take up a lot of their time. The games and practices could make them very tired and performing community service may add to that exhaustion causing them not to any homework or other requirements.

I understand that doing this is a big help to the community, but they also need something else going on besides this. At least going to a movie or to the mall every once in a while. Though it makes sense that they need to think about other people and not always themselves. Helping the community or environment around you really makes a difference.

Principle I'm not saying that you should have every student perform community service and I'm also not saying you shouldn't. All I'm putting forward is that either way I support community service and I know other kids do too.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
