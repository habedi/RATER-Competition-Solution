To my principal,

The community is very important to most everybody but, I think the students at SCHOOL_NAME should take action and help clean up the community. Most people think its gross and not for them. Just imagine how much greater it will be if we all pitch in and clean up. They talk about on the news how ocean life is dying because of the trash on the beaches. Everybody does the things why not help? People don't understand what this does to our nation. My only question is WHY? No one can explain to us the things we do but I have to learn to deal with it, now I want to make a big change. In my life I grew up cleaning the sides of the road for fun now I want to do it to help all life from eating it and dying, especially for no reason! Please take some stand and make some of SCHOOL_NAME grounds cleaner and help make panthers really roar. We have a whole life to live why not live it right. To me it is very important and no one can take that away from me. So if you don't care then I'm ok with it. Almost every other day or more there is something said on the news about how the animals have been dying and people have discovered that its because they eat trash and they cant digest it and die. Everyone has a purpose and if you don't want to help then its okay, some day someone will want to do the same thing and you will be the one who makes that major change one day. Just remember to help and tell me what you think and if you like it then that makes a great start. Please say yes and help the community we need you to help! All i want is for you to say yes and if not then just let us make the difference without you.
