Students learn better if they are interested in what they are being taught. Teachers can't help struggling students if they don't know what students are interested in and the way they learn best. Therefore if students design their own summer projects they will be actively engaged in what is happening and understand what they are learning. Teachers the following year will then have a little bit of knowledge about what interests students, what will help them be more engaged, and how to help out students if they are struggling. With students being able to design their own summer projects it will benefit both students and teachers because students will be interested in what they are learning and teachers will know what students are interested in so they can help students in a way in which they can actually learn.

Student-designed projects will help increase grades and academic performance as well. With students being able to design their own summer projects, this allows teachers to help students utilize the way they study best by breaking down the way that their project was completed. This is important because once teachers are able to help students figure out the best way to study then their grades will go up and they will be doing good in school. But on the other hand if teachers were to design projects every summer students might not like the specific task he or she is assigned and it will cause them to lose interest in the project. If the student loses interest in their project it will also cause them to not do the project anymore and if it is graded then they will already have a bad grade for the quarter and that is already a bad start to the year. This will also cause a bad reputation for the student as a first impression and the student will not be able to get all the help he or she needs to be able to study well.

School is a main way for students to be able to express themselves through what they enjoy and the topics they favor. Students being able to design their own projects is a big way in which students can express themselves because by representing what they enjoy they can have a chance at being able to learn more about that specific topic in school that year. By doing a project on something that interests you it shows the teacher that you are interested in that topic and that could cause the teacher to want to teach it to the class and you will be able to understand and want to engage in class conversations on the topic because it's something that you would look forward to. This will also help by giving you the opportunity to show what you know and to be able to engage in a topic of your liking. By being able to design a project and fulfilling it, it will also show that you are doing it because you want to where if you were to do a project in which was designed by a teacher, they will not know whether you are completing it because you have to or if you want to.

Students being able to design their own projects will really be able to show whether they are committed to doing a project. It will show whether they are ready for the class and if they would be willing to spend a good amount of time specifically for the project. It will also show if they are ready for college and if they are prepared. Most importantly it will show what kind of student they are based on completion and effort. Being able to design your own summer project is a big responsibility and you need to be dedicated to finishing and working hard on your project not only because it is required but also to help you figure out the best way in which you can learn. Since teachers don't know what students are interested in it would be better for students to choose how they want to create their own projects. Overall if students were to create their own projects it would help identify in which way they learn best, what kind of a student they are, and what they are interested in.
