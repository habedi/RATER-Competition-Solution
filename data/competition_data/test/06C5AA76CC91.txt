In the story the author gives us reasonable decisions on why we should go to Venus. It forms like earth and its clled the Earth? twin sister. The author provides a lot of information. One of them states ¨

may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago,Venus was probably covered laregley with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life¨ this cold very well be a lot like earth. There are sea level just like earth and there ¨ familiar features such as valleys ,mountains,and craters.¨These areall the same thing that Earth has,It also says that this Venus could have very well had ocean covering all of it.

The atricle states that they are going on missions and gettin machines to go and figure out why Venus is so much more life-like Earth. The nNAtional Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is trying to do visits with humans to see if they can live there Becuase it states that ¨ iNot easy conditions, but it is survivable for humans¨which very well means that we can live there for a long period of time. They are doing so ich reasearch on this planet becuase they are worried of Earth very well not being here one day.

This could go both wasy this could very well be a successful mission or it could be a very dangerous and unsure mission. That are traking research and countinuing finding more ways to make sure that humans will not have any problems while living in Venus. When they have everything solved they will send humans and see how their bodies will react to the way Venus makes them. Never know this ight be the next great discovery that NASA wil make happen and save all of us.
