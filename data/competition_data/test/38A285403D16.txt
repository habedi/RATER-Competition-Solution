The Face of Mars, could of been made up by anything like weather conditions, the way it rotates, or by aliens as what scientist at NASA might say. The pictures of the face of Mars shows that some condition has been making it look like a real human face over the past years. NASA is very high tech so they have some of the best scientist in the world working there and I'm pretty sure they know what their talking about. NASA has discoverd other very cool things about Mars over the past couple of years. But this is very intsrarresting because, finding a planet that might have a human face carved or made by aliens that is 2-miles long. Not that I'm on NASA side they could be wrong too. NASA is not the only place in the world people go too.

The picture shows a buttle or mesa, but like I said NASA doesn't know most of the stuff they think they know because they don't know weather its a buttle or a mesa. Again NASA is high tech some of the equiment is hand made aka manmade. I my opinion I do not believe in aleins because if they were real they wouldo've been invaded the world.
