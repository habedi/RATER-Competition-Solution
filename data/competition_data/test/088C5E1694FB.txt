Dear, principal

I don't think that you should change the policy to "all students should have a "B" average to do sports or other activities" ,because the students really loves the activities they do. i know that because I'm one of those students who loves the activities that they do for the school they go to every day. I think that if you have a high "C"

you should be able to do the activities that you are doing. but i believe that most of these activities really motivate the students to keep there grades up, because i know for a fact that if you in any activities there parents, teachers, coaches will tell them that cant do the activities they doing because of the grades they have in there class. If the students didn't have no activities i really think that will be failing

Students that have terrible grades i think that they shouldn't do any extra activities until they at least bring that grade up to a high "c". but i really disagree with your change but its your decision to chose to change the policy or keep it the same. but also go look what the other student said about this policy.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
