Have you ever wanted to exploreteh world? Well if you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program you would be able to. There are all kinds of different places you go when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. There are also some jobs you have to do like cleaning out the stables and feeding the animals, but it is a lot of fun.

The text states " He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime." It will make you feel free being on a boat. The Part that is the best is getting to see all the wounderful sights. You could go to China, Italy, Greece, and other places. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you can exlpore different places of the world. You get to meet different people and see how their coulture is different.

The second best thing is all the free time you have after the animals get droped off. The text states, " The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time." There are all kinds of games you can play, so you will not be bored.

It is fun getting to interact with people from different cultures. It is also really cool to be on a boat with your friends and animals. All you have to do is clean out the animals housing area and give them food and water. You also get to interact with the animals when you feed and water them.
