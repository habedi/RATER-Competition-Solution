The electonal are very impornont for the people in the u. s because they need better leader in which they vote every four years.

There 270 electoral vores required to elect the preasident well the 23rd Amendment only let's us have 3 elecotor and treated like for state for purposes of the electoral college were 'discussin the word state also refers to the districy of columbia'.

Why dosen't the u. s just have better party well we only the two great party but  what about the other onces? we as people should change that because i don't think it's very fair to have only have two big party somepeople would agree with me if we just ask qustion about why should we should have more big party but why not all of us should change that for the last 300 years we have been vote for the party.

"In 1976 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have just deadlocked the election 1976 a tie would have occurred if a" mere 5,559 voter in Ohio state by 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way election 'is only a few swing voters aways from catastrpe".

Do you know if state have lots of vote on which they vote for the person who is running for president they would mostly be in office by just only four state if they get very high vote lets ask in explan like Ohia they get 50% of the votes most likely they would be the president of the u. s that just a fact right there to show you.

In 1968 thorw 1992 they both had only a 43 percent of plurality  if popular votes, while winning every electoral and college 301,370 respectively invariably produces a clear winner of which they vote for like for explain like obam they mostly vote for him over about 2 years ago back in 2012 well that because big states vote for him and he got to be the president for the last 6 years of office.
