Dear, Senator

There are many ways in keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of keeping the Electoral College.  The Electoral College is a difficult process to go through.  The Electoral College consists of the electors, where they vote for the President and the Vice President and also the counting of the elctoral votes by Congress.  Electoral College is unfair, outdated to the voters, by using the election by popular votes for the president of the United States is fair to voters because they get to choose the person to run the office for four years.

To begin with, in favor keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is very helpful for the voters to vote easily to choose and listen to the candidates to see who will be great to the world.  In source 3: "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner in paragragh 20 states, "Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decided the election".  What this quote is trying to say that letting the voters choose and listen to the candidtes very carefully to decide on the election, who will be helpful.  Letting voters vote are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and that they will recieved the most information and attetion from the candidates.  By aruging keeping the popular votes for the president of the united States is very fair to the voters.

Furthermore, the people such as the voters help choose the state's elsctors when you are voting for the President.  For example, in soruce 1: "What Is the Electoral College?" by the Office of the Fedral Register in paragragh 6 say, "You help choose your state's electors when you vote for Presidnet because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."  This quote explains that the voters get to choose the President but it's actually voting for the candidate's electors.  It's more easier keeping the popular vote for the Presidnet of Unites States instead of keeping the Electoral College because its a difficult process to go through.

Its true that election by popular vote for the president of United States is a good argument for the voters to choose wisley.  As this can be seen as in source 2: "The Indfensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer in paragragh 9 states, "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."  For example, in the 2000 U.S presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election by receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 226.  By keeping the popular vote for the President of the United States is more easier for the society instead of using the Electoral College.

In Conclusion, why keep the Electoral College, when you can you use the popular vote.

So by keeping the popular votes is useful to let these people vote on who they want to choose.  So by other people perspective, you should keep the popular votes.

Sincerly, anonymous, hopefully your satisfied.
