As technology increases throughout the years, more and more opportunities seem to open up for the public. One of these opportunities is the ability to attend classes at home, by way of video conferences or online courses. However at first glance this may seem like a great idea, there is always an argument that can be made about whether or not these new ideas are beneficial or hurtful. Although some may argue that attending classes from home is not a good idea because students miss out on beneficial social interaction, attending classes from home is a good idea because students work at their own pace, make their own schedule, and avoid consequences from missing school .

To begin with, attending online school or participating in video lectures is beneficial because it allows students to work at their own pace. One of the biggest problems in schools today is that students are forced to work at a pace that is set for them by either their teachers or the other students in their classes. For example, if several students do not understand a subject that is being taught while the rest of the class does, the teacher is likely to move on without helping the, "slower students." By taking the courses online these students are able to work at their own pace and can seek help without wasting class time. Although it may seem as if only struggling students can benefit from working at their own pace, smart students can also benefit by working at their own pace. Smart students are often trapped doing useless work and listening to pointless lectures, due to the fact that they already understand the subject that is being taught. By taking online school these students can avoid this predicament and move on whenever they are ready. The ability for a student to work at their own pace is necessary in order for them to reach their full academic potential.

In addition, attending classes from home is beneficial because students get to choose their own schedule. If a student were to take classes at home, they would be able to do schoolwork and learn whenever they please. Also, these students would likely be able to accomplish a days work in a time span much shorter than a school day's. This flexibility means that students would be able to spend much more time doing other important things. For example, a student could do online school and still have the time to follow their dream of playing junior ice hockey. Students would also be able to work more hours at a job, which could help them save up for their next level of education or contribute towards paying bills that their family may be struggling with. Online school is beneficial because it allows students to prioritize things in a much more flexible fashion.

Furthermore, taking courses online allows students to avoid the consequences of missing school. Some students are required to miss school due to health issues, sports, or even family vactions. Although these absences are often times excused, students are forced to suffer the consequences of missing class. Some of these consequences can be receiving zeroes on missed classwork, being forced to attend school on the weekends, and being required to take finals at the end of the year. If these students were able to make up for their missed class time by taking classes at home, they would not have to suffer these unfair consequences. For example, my sister has torn her ACL and has had appendicitisÂ during her senior year, causing her to miss a large amount of days. She is now being forced to go to school on Saturdays in order to make up for her missed days. If she were to make up the classes at home she would not be forced to attend Saturday school and miss important days of work. Taking classes at home is a great alternative to the consequences that are given to those who miss school

In conclusion, taking courses at home is beneficial because it allows students to learn at their own speed, make their own agenda, and avoid the consequences of being absent. If more students were to take classes from home, then they would be much more productive and smarter. If your school does not offer an option to take courses online, ask them to look in to making it an option.
