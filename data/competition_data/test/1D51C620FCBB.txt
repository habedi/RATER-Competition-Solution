Dear Principal,

I understand you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

The first policy, I believe, would be more convenient for most students.

Some students participate in clubs or activities after school; therefore, they might have to call in order to get picked up.

If a student leaves a homework assignment or another important item at home, they could use there cell phones to have someone bring it for them.

A student might need there cell phone to call there parents or friends about an activity they planned to do after school.

Since cell phones are a disruption during class time, the students must turn them completely off.

The teacher should be allowed to check if a students phone is on or off, and if it is on they should be allowed to take it.

I strongly suggest you choose Policy One because it will not only help the students, but it will help the parents also.

Sincerely,
