Dear Principal

I choose policy 1, because its not bad to have their phones out at lunch period or any free time they have. I just think they should have them at their free time.

Well here are some reasons why I think that. Well for one they are not doing any school work or anything that's for school so why would you make them be bored. For second they can have their phones out and do want they want so they don't have to do it in class and get caught. Its not a bad idea and you should let the students have something that they want, because they are in school for like 8 hours and that's so bad. It drives me crazy everyday, I have to sit in a chair and do work and not even have my phone out at free time. Seriously that's wrong well I think it is and I probably think a lot of students do too. So you should let them have their phones out at free time, because they will love it and they probably will put it up when class starts. Just give them a chance and see how they do and if they have there phones out in class then say no more phones at free time anymore. Would you like to get chance at something that you would probably want? Well think about that for a while. I don't even know why we cant have our phones out at free time seriously we are not doing anything unless we are talking to our friends. So what is they big deal about having our phones out at free time, Do you really want to be rude and makes us wait in till we get out of school before we can use our phones. I just think its a good idea and I hope you do too because its awesome and amazing idea I don't know what other idea can think of.

Well anyways think about what I asked you and see what your answer is, because its not a bad idea about having our phones out at free time. I would be really happy if you did let them and that would make them a hole lot better. I bet if you had a phone when you were little and you wanted it out so you can be on it, but I don't know. Well the only I'm trying to say is give them a chance and see how they do because you will never know unless you try.
