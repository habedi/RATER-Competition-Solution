Dear Principal,

I heard that your considering having students bring cell phones to school to use them during free time, like during lunch. I think that's a great idea. Students will be very happy if you reconsidered the cell phone policy. You should reconsidered the cell phone policy because, students use their cell phones to keep in contact with their parents. It also gives us a reason not to use our cell phone during class. we should have the new cell phone policy because it makes us not feel like we're closed off from the world while we're at school. Students are apart of the learning community, don't you think you should trust us with such a simple policy?

One reason you should reconsider the cell phone policy is because, students use their cell phones to keep in contact with their parents. Parents tell us what is happing while we're at school. They also need to know that we're ok. Things that may happen outside of school may vary, and our parents want to get in contact with us the fastest was they can with out conflict. Parents play a big role in our life, and even when we're not with them they need a way to stay in contact with us.

In addition, you should reconsider the cell phone policy because, it gives us a reason to not us our cell phones during class. Cell phones play a big part in our life, and
