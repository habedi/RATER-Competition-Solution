Well the Omna Lisa is a good paint but now that they are trying to know what was her expresion. I think it is good for 1 reason. Bad for 1 reason. The technology is going to know about the expresion that you have and the facial expresion if you are fakeing it or it is natural.

It is a good reason because they can discover the expresion of the paints like Mona Lisa but the same time for the fake people who just are being fake.

And it could be able to use for the president to see if they smile its natural or fake. To the special people if they are being honest because that can be seen by they face expresions that's what I read.

However the bad reason is that they could use it to all the people and know that they are not feeling good or that type of stuf that is private in that way. But also they can had the or ask the permission for the people so if they can see their expresions because it is private for what are your feeling inside.

In conclusion it is good and bad. Becuase we can discover from famous paints or photos that had expresions. But for the present it would be something that is private and cannot violate by they rights. But in conclusion I think it would be good but just to use ir in old and past things that would like to be discovered in the present.
