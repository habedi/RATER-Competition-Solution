Most of are population use phones on a day to day basis. We use them every were when we are at school, at a family dinner, we even use phones in the car. Is it safe to use them in a car though. I believe that using your phone in the car can be safe at times but also be life taking another.

I feel like they can be safe at time because using it at a stop light while your waiting i thank is fine. I think it's all about the time and place you use your phone. Because if you need your phone for an important phone call you will most likely pick up the phone where you are at. This could be safe because that important phone call could save a life. If you didn't answer your phone something whose could of happened.

I believe that it could be life taking because going down the highway going 60 and running into someone would be pretty bad for everyone. Another place that using your phone at that is dangerous would be when there in a intersection or in traffic because looking at your phone for a second you could already hit someone.
