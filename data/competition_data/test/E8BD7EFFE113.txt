I think driverless cars are dangerous. Driverless cars are not on the rode today because there is not enough information about the cars, to know if their are safe or not. Driverless cars are cool to imagine about,but their are things that should be thought about before putting driverless cars into society. BMW announced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant." the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25mph,and the car has special touch sensors to make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. The Driverless car that BMW is presenting sounds cool,but it is not safe. The car isnt all the way driveless, and someone has to hold the cars steering wheel . What if the person in the driver seat falls asleep while the car is driving itself, and the car tries to alert the person to drive, because there is a work zone, or an accident coming up, and the person in the driver seat doesn't wake up. That could be a serious accident. Driverless Cars are fasinating to people because some people may like the idea of " Not holding the cars steering wheel." Plus, you dont have to worry about turning the car at a street corner, or hitting the breaks , but people need to realize that some things that you might find fasinating, can sometimes be things that are not as great as they seem.
