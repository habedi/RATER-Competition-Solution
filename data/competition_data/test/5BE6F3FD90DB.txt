Online learning would be useful to the student's who struggle in school not because it is hard, but because the environment of the school is just not suited for them. Some kids struggle talking to adults or making friends or even just the thought of presenting gives them so much anxiety they end up not dong well just because of not presenting. One friend of mine recently moved away to another school and the thought of starting over junior year, making new friends, having to build new relationships with all new teachers just gave her so much to think about and too much anxiety and just all around stressed her out. The first day came around and I heard about the chatter and the looks that she got and she already knew that this year was going to be hard, and the fact that she is already a struggling student added on to the awful high school experience she knew she was about to have.

Highschool is not at all like what you see in the movies, don't get me wrong it is for some, but it's very few kids who actually have the perfect high school experience. For the students who don't have that experience and struggle more, online or video chatting with a teacher so they can get one on one help would help with easing the anxiety and pressure. Also the kids who need more attention than others can get the help they need without feeling like they are interrupting the whole class or feel embarrassed because everyone else understands what's going on but them. Having the feeling of comfort is important while learning because if the student is not comfortable then they tend to drift off and not pay attention and when they don't pay attention they end up not learning. Doing online school gives the comfort and that safe feeling of knowing what you are doing and when to do it without feeling tense about being late to class, seeing someone you got into an argument with or even something that happened two weeks ago and it's still on your mind because you see that person every day.

However, not going to high school can be a bad thing because you would not get the highschool expierence good or bad. Not interracting with people and staying in your room all day doing nothing is bad for you because that student would have no life outside of the house. Everything they need is in the house so there would be no reason for them to leave which means no sunlight, highschol sports, new friends, social skills or anything. Social skills are the main thing to be worried about because they are needed for a good job. My mom is a realtor and interacts with people evry day and she tells me all the time when I do not want to go to school anymore she reminds me of my friends and I would be bored all day not talking to anyone because they are all in school. School is a major stress but even if it is bad it gives you a sense of what a job is going to feel like when school is over.

In the long run I think yes for the few ammount of kids that struggle with school it would be beneficial because not everyone learns, thinks or feels the same way at school. No one knows what goes on at everyones homes and everyone is so quick to judge and make opinions and its so easy to put others down, and when one of these students finally snaps, most of the time they will assume it is the home life but in reality it's being at the place that makes them feel not wanted that makes them flip out. I think kids should have the option of online school if school makes them feel that bad and just not want to get up in the morning and every day it is the sme struggle, same stress and same people, they should get to choose.
