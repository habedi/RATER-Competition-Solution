Dear Principle,

If a policy change came in to effect it would not only ruin chances for young adults to participate in activities such as sports it would take away our chances of truly seeing a winning side in all of us. I realize some kids don't find their education very useful, but give opportunities for students ,so they can explore a new way of thinking. Whenever I'm involved in sports my grades are my main priority and it really helps to know that even with a low grade I'll have a coach and my teammates to push me towards success.

With the new standards coming in affect students might not always understand things and begin to fall behind the rest of their peers. Even struggles at home could cause stress that makes them feel that school means nothing. Why shouldn't all students find joy in playing sports even the ones who just cant find it in them to show greatness? We are all unique and possess skills for all types of social and physical education. Giving the students a chance to fully find their potential might allow them to grasp that hard work pays off.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
