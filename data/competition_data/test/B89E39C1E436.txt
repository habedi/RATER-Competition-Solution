Dear Principal,

I am a student at your school and understand that you are considering making it a requirement to do community service at our school. I think that is an outstanding idea and should be made a requirement right away. Community service is a vital component to the well being of the environment, animals, children, adults.... everyone. We can't live in filth, We need to care enough about our surroundings and pitch in to keep our society in tact. This could make an incredulous impact on not just us but to people miles away. It only takes one snowflake to start and avalanche, we can be that snowflake. Imagine what it would be like if everyone littered, vandalized property, and no one did anything about it, we would be living in a life sized dumpster. Community service doesn't have to be a punishment or a chore, make it a field trip it could be a fun activity involving all students. This could be the start of a whole new look at our community. I know that you care about our community so start acting like it. The point is we need to take pride in our society and keep it clean and requiring students to perform community service is a great way to start. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Your community caring student
