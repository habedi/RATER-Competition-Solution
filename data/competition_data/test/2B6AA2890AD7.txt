The Face was discovered by NASA in 1976 when the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking photos for landing sites for Viking 2. It spotted a human-face like landform sticking out of the surface of the Red Planet. Later on, in 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took another photo of the face, revealing a natural landform, not a martian construction. Another photo in 2001 revealed no alien markings, martian buildings, or transportation.

Conspiracy theorists are guessing it was made by alien life and NASA is hiding something. Why should we? We want people to know wether martians are or were on mars. How can we do that if we don't give people all the facts?

If aliens built the Face, would there not be places to live, machinery, or other alien markings?

Plus, wouldn't the aliens have done a flawless job, not left random bumps and ledges? It is a natural process that happened when Mars formed.

Aliens did not make the face, there is no evidence.

NASA holds true to its oath of honesty and wec are not hiding anything. Marsa has a butte, not martians. And conspiracy tyheorists should try proving aliens exist instead of accusing highly trained professionals that they are lieing.
