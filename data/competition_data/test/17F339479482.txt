Summer is the time for students to have fun and enjoy their break to the fullest extent. However, it is also the time when students forget all the knowledge they learned in school. To prevent this from occuring, schools require students to complete summer projects. The students' experiences and knowledge could provide a unique design to their summer projects. Therefore, summer projects that are assigned to assure students continue learning during their break should be student-designed because they will have more freedom to use their creativity and they will have less stress by doing something they want to do.

To start, students are capable of developing something creative when they are given the choice to pick what they want to do. For instance, a student can think of many impressive ideas to base their project on. Forcing a student to work on something they did not choose limits their creativity and decreases their interest in the project. In addition, when a student cannot pick their project, they tend to turn in something horrible. If students are allowed to work on something they feel passionate about, they will put the effort to develop something of good quality. Therefore, students will make an outstanding project if they decide what to do.

Furthermore, students will be less stressful. School work is an unavoidable stressor that causes students to turn in bad work. If teachers design the project, some students will be stressed because they might not know what to do. For example, a foreign exchange student can be assigned a project about American traditions. The student's stress will rise due to not knowing anything other than his countries' traditions. As a result, a student's lack of knowledge about an assigned topic will lead to the stress of knowing they will receive a bad grade. Also, stress can have a negative impact on vunerable students. To illustrate, students who do not handle stress well can stop enjoying their summer and fall into depression or anxiety. There are many students who are scared of humiliation in front of their peers; presenting a bad project will not only increase their stress but it will decrease their self-esteem. In summary, working on a teacher-designed project will increase students' stress levels.

Although a teacher can design a project that will encourage students to learn something new, students will feel more confortable working on something they want to work on. It is for this reason that they should have the liberty of choosing their project. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they can be creative and students will not be stressed.
