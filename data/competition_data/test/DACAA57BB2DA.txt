Dear Principal,

I have heard that you have been reconsidering the cell phone policy on your school. And that is not something I blame you for, considering that the student body have been using their phones when the teacher is giving lessons. If I were the principal, I would have pick Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

You must look at their perspective. If you have picked Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all, what would the students think? They would think, "Why did the principal outlawed cell phones in our school?" They would then, protest to it and at one point in time, would rebel against the school.

But let us remove that scenario out of our minds and think about the people who doesn't uses their phones during class time and only uses it during where class is not being taught?

Yes, that by removing phones in the school students would be probably, paying more attention to lectures, but did you ever consider that they would also not pay attention? They would not pay attention to the class because it would be a sign of rebellion that cell phones should be allowed, not illegal.

Also, what about where the student is sick and wants to be pick up during lunch? Maybe one of the staff would see her taking out her cell phone and confiscate it and the student would get more sick, who will probably not attend school, the following day. So you see, dear principal, it is best to have Policy 1, instead of Policy 2. Student will still have their phones, but at least it would not be during class time where they would pay attention.

Sincerely, the student body
