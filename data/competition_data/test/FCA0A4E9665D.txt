You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you could go places like europe,china,greece. You could have fun and explore places also it's not hard work all you have to do is clean and feed the animals. Luke liked the Seagoing Cowboys because he could travel places he could have not gone to before he liked being on the boat. He had fun when the unloaded the animals with the rest of people on the ship he played tennis, ping pong in the animals housing. They played diffrent kinds of games that passed time but it was kinda hard working there because if it was raining hard and you had to feed the animals you would still go outside and feed them. Luke hurt himself doing that he fell when the boat was shaking and cracked his ribs but he could still walk but he had to take a brake from doing any work. There's also another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys you could have a chance to work as a team with other people and aboard the ship with your friend or family member or cousin. There is my point of view why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
