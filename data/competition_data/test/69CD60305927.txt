sciencetists say its worth to dicover even more about Venus becuase i could maintane humans in the future. but also give use resources to support human life

Bad things why we shoun't go to Venus is sciencetists say its not worth to take risk becuase it could are human nature becuase of the tempetuares in Venus up to 170 that could cause harms for many humans the are alergic to the sun and it will take years for us humans to travel to Venus since it the second plant on the solar system ti could take us years to be able to reach are piont. also machines can't be able to survive in Venus becuase the heatness and the weather on the planet. it also have a lot of challenges for scientists becuase they still hanve't discover the whole plant on Venus it could still have dangroues things before we go and live in it.

NASA is working on the machines so that we could be able to see what Venus still has for us humns. can it support humans or not.

REasons we we should go so that if earth gets destoyed we could go to a different plant and maintene human life again. it could guve us more human resouces for oilgas and many more. but also Venus has a value for the solar system
