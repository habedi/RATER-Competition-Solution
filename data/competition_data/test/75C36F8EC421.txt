Dear Principal,

I believe policy 1 is the best one because it allows us to talk with our friends and socialize more. We will not have our phones during class time because you gave us the privilege to have our phones at certain times. If a gunman had came into out school, the 911 call responder will defiantly get a call about an gunman in the school. Also have our phone in school ours is good because we can boost are socialism up and be more confident in our selves.

By having our phones in school a gunmen will surly not hurt as many people because the report of him in the school will surly be high and lots of policeman would come and bring him to custody. This will save lots of injury's that probably would of happen.

Having our cell phones in school will bring our socialism up because we could talk to people more and for victims of being bullied would be stop because you can be more social, that could be a nice avoid.

Having your socialism up you could get better grades, get into a good college then become a doctor or something else because you graduating with a diploma from college. Now your life style would be great and now you have more friends and what could you want possibly more.
