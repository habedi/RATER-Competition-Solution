Yes, because with Facial Action Coding System we can find out did someone lie to us or not, we can also find in picture person was happy or not, and we can find person's emotion weather he/she is happy or not.

My first reason Facial Action Coding System we can find out did person front of us lie to us or not. "To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful." According to me it will be helpful because we can find person in front of us is lie to us or not.

My second reason we can find person in picture is happy or not. In picture Mona Lisa was "83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." According to me we can express how person is feeling while taking picture.

My third reason we can find person's emotion weather he/she is happy or not. "The facial expression for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)." According to me with Facial Action Coding System we can express others feeling if they were not happy we can help them and make them smile.

These are my three main reasons why Facial Action Coding System is helpful in our life.
