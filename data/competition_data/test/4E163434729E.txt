Have you ever been bored at home wishing you had something to do? Extracurricular activities could be the solution you're looking for. A daily occurrenceÂ that happens to students and myself is that at some point you end up texting your friends because you're bored school can help change that. Extracurricular activities that students can participate in are Sports,Student Council,and Yearbook.

Sports are a big part of schools all around the world since it has many advantages. One thing that sports can help in is helping students stay active throughout the day. Doctors recommend staying active because the body becomes stronger and healthier. Another benefit ,believe it or not, is that Sports can help students work better together. People say theres no I in team thats because in order for a group of people to come together they need to improve they're teamwork to be successful. This extracurricular activities is suitable for many people because of the variety of sports that there are. It takes time for someone to find what they like to do,but because of all the choices students can try different sports until they find one that they enjoy best. One thing that I like about sports best is that they have endless opportunities for you to enjoy yourself.

If Sports isn't your thing you can try Student Council it also has many things to offer. In Student Council you have the chance in meeting new people all the time. The council requires you to work and talk to many people to help better the school and other students daily lives. As you grow older you'll acquire many life skills all student council will do is improve those skills to better prepare you for the next chapter in your life. Think of student council as an office they both have similar ways of running and getting work down the only difference is that they're on different scales. The thing about student council is that they do many things but a big role they play is helping others. The council does many projects to help students and the community like donating,holding fundraisers,and community service. Student Council plays a big role in school,students,and the community if you're the type of person that enjoys helping others Student council is just for you!

On the other hand many people say that an extracurricular activity takes your time away or is a waste of time. The reason for this is that many activities are held after school instead of school hours. However this is not true,nor correct,because extracurricular activities were not designed to take and waste students time. Students will be able to still be able to enjoy and relax during their free time. This is because the activities only take away a small portion of a students daily life plus there are some activities that are held during school hours like yearbook allowing students to take it as a class.

Every school has a wide range of clubs or activities,so that all the students can choose one to their liking that way they can enjoy it other then having to take something they have no interest in doing. Taking a extracurricular activities has many good outcomes and benefits from helping students improve their skills to allowing them to enjoy themselves and have fun. Taking part in a club affects everybody in a positive form it also is a good way for students to be more productive while having fun.
