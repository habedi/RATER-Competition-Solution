In this artical is cool how this technology can read peoples faces as in emotions. If this can really happen then its going to jsut how people learn in school. in a way were it mite be fun to go to school.

I am for this technology because it can help students learn more about school. The face emotion technology is mind blowing if it works. If you think about it the computer can tell when your happy or sad which is awesome.

So when your working on a subject on your computer and the computer sees that your sad its going to make it were your happy. If your happy then its going to make you stay happy.

It goes in to the it will be a 3-D computer modle to track your face. If that happens then they would have to get everyones face in the United States and everywhere else around the world. To me i think its cool.

To me I think its a really good thing to try and see if it works. If it can tell if your happy then i say lets go for it and make everyone happy and get the world into a positive world. Students need it the most because there are so may negative students in schools and they need to start being happy for themselfs and for others in there garde and there fellow students. So I'm all for it to have this 3-D face modle thing to make you happy.
