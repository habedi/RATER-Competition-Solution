Dear Principle,

I as a former sports player think that taking sports away from those to whom do not consist of having a grade of a B average does not seem very fair. I myself am sure that they can bring up their grades and can try to maintain a B average. Although for some students it is a bit of a struggle to keep a B average because they are so very active in their school and their community. Well with all the things they do and having to keep up with all their school work it may be a bit hard to keep a B average and so they end up maintaining a C average which is still considered passing. I know you want us to strive for excellence and go above and beyond and don't just keep our C average just because its passing. For those who struggle in some areas of school it takes them time to learn the material and they cant quite maintain a B average like your asking.

Personally I love to win my meets and games that I play at. I love the feeling I get when I know that I accomplished something that day by winning. I also know for a fact that you as our principle love how it feels when other teachers and staff from other schools comes up and congratulates you on how awesome your sports and other clubs and such are doing. But if you change the school policy to having only kids with a B average and above get to play sports and do the clubs we have then you wont get that good feeling because many kids who do sports or participate in school events or clubs maintain a C average. That means we wont win much because we wont have enough kids on the sports teams or in the clubs to help us win. So i say you keep it at having let kids with a C average play sports or other activities in our school because they love sports and participating in school clubs and such. They just are not as good as some kids who can maintain a B average or above and still participate in the clubs or sports or whatever they like to do after school. I am asking as a former sports player that you let kids who can maintain a C average or above play sports or do any of the activities they like to participate in after school.
