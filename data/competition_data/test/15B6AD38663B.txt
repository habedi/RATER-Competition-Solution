Students should design the projects that they have to do over summer break not the teachers. If they are designed by the students than they are more likely to make the projects high quality. All school year the teachers create and assign the work so the students should get a chance to create there own work to give the teachers a break. This would be a great oppurtunity for students to learn about something that they are specifically interested in. Students should be the ones designing there summer projects.

When people have an input on what is happening that gives them a bigger sense of excitment for the task. If a person is excited for something than they are going to want to do well on whatever it is. In order to create some excitment for a summer project the students should get to use there creativity to design there very own. There is no reason a teacher would want a student to perform poorly on any assignment. By allowing the students to use there creativity to design there own project is a great way to optimize success on these summer projects.

All school year the teachers are the ones who decide what the assignments will be and how they are going to be done. The students then have to conform to the teachers requests and do the assignments how the teacher expects them to be done. Now the students are going into summer break and have to do more school work. They should get a say in what is being done because they really havent gotten that oppurtunity during the school year. This would also be a great way for teachers to get new ideas for future assignments as well. The students would now get more freedom on what they can do and the teachers can pick up some new ideas for future lessons when school returns. This could really improve teachers lessons and be a great way to grab students attention.

These projects are assigned over summer break to make sure students continue to learn even on a long beak from school. Students would learn more if they got to choose what the project was, based on there interests on specific topics. Even if the topic isnt something thats needed for school students are continuing to sharpen the way they process things when learning which will help them in school. Due to them getting to put there effort into potentaly learning more about something not specifically addressed in school before. This could help some students in the future when deciding what there major will be while attending college.

Allowing students to design there own summer projects will create good oppurtunities for both students and teachers. Students will be more likely to do well on a project they got to design. Teachers would get a break from having to come up with an assignment. This will create a great oppurtinity for students to expand there knowledge on something that they are truly interested in. If there is going to be a summer project having them be student designed is a fantastic idea.
