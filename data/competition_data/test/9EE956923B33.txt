Dear Principle,

I feel that it is not mandatory for students to perform community service.

The kids who do it most likely want to get into an impeccable collage, or just help out in the community.

Personally, I don't have much time to dedicate myself to it, since I'm extremely busy with perfecting my homework.

I also have other out-of-school activities like music, but sometimes when I'm not doing work, I need to take a break and spend some time with friends or playing.

If it were required to do community service, many students wouldn't have the time to do it, and some might not even be fit for the job!

Already, many kids have homework and with community service to top it off, they would be all worn out, and probably schools would have kids falling asleep in class.

The teachers wouldn't be too pleased with those results!

Some students may not be very good with helping people, they could be more of a scientist than a social worker.

They should work on social skills, but they should do this in other ways.

Someone may get their feelings hurt when the student tries to do community service, if they aren't compatible with others.

If you feel strongly about kids doing community service, I suggest making a presentation about it, to show kids how it is like, so maybe more will be willing to do it.

Or for one day, the whole school could participate in community service activity.

This would give kids a chance to learn more about it and give them a chance to see what it would be like.

Sincerely,

A Middle School Student
