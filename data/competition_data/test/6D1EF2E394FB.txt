Driverless cars are cominng or are more accidents coming? Would you rather be saft than sorry? There are cars that has been driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but can you truly trust a google car that is driverless? Your on the road and you need to get something out your bag so you put it on driverless mode, and all of a sudden boom u hit another car. What happen you had it on driverless mode an its suppoes to tell you if your getting close to aonther car or an object. Technology doesnt always work.

Driverless car requider massive upgrades,that can be too expensive to be practical. they need lots and lots of sensors,they suppose to have flashing lights on the windshield and other heads up on display but this can all go out in a heartbeat. What if water gets on the seat will that mess up the vibration when it is letting you know your backing up or when your by a dangours object. If technology fails and someone is injured who fault is it, the driver or the manufacturer? tesla has a projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on a 90 percent of the time. Just think about it would you rather be saft than sorry? Think smart about the road, youself, and other people around you.
