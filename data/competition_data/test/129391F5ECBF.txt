Do you think it is important to have school clubs? because a lot of people like it and dislike it. At Generic_School they are having a vote for should they have clubs or they should not. Do you think it is important to have one well I do and here are the reasons.

You can make new friends! This is a big one because some people dont know how to get friends. This is a good way because if you join a club that has the same in tress! Evidence shows that at Shepherd university said that students have made more friends through clubs or something outside of school. A other study at Shepherd shows that that are in clubs have more friends than kids in no club.

Clubs can make you relaxed and more happy about your self. At Boston collage they have found kids in clubs are more relaxed than kids in no club. Dr. Newman said "When I went there the kids were relaxed and happy, Then when I went to a other school with no clubs they seemed stressed". Boston collage also studied that kid that have a higher self a steam will do better in school."The kids that are more happy will get better grades and the kids that arent as happy will get lower grades". said Dr. Newman. He also said "That is not the case all the time".

There are a lot of types of clubs to! "At Generic_School there are tons of clubs". Said Generic_Name the principle for the school. There is RC club, foursquare club, book club, snake club, and many others! Generic_Name said "There are clubs for every student!" So it seems like you can have a club for everyone! This helps students relax and have lots of fun with your friends. "Generic_School has been doing this for years, Also the students think it is great!" said Generic_Name.

But what if the kids are behind on work is there a club for that? And what if a kid does not like to be in a club so what are they going to do? At Florida state university a studie has shown that some kids use the clubs to go to the bathroom and just stay in there the hole time. This can make the kids have bad habets. So the kids that are behind on work will just have to wait till they get home. What happens if the kid does not have a good house hold and he cant get his work done because of it.

Well thats why they have the homework club. you can do any work you can in there! Like math, science, english, civics, art, and many others! At Generic_School a kid named Generic_Name said "I get all my work done in there and when were done we read or study for a test! The kids that dont want to do a club will still get to pick a club but they will chose homework mostof the time.

In the end it seems like clubs are a great thing and they help out with students health! They also seem to be more happy and relaxed. The kids in the homework club like it because they can get help from multible teachers.
