With the advent of modern technology changing the very infrastructure of society, having its effects felt through the different facets of daily life is but par for the course. Although these changes can vary depending on what field you may be looking at, education is without a doubt one of the most heavily affected of the bunch. The digitization of the classroom is a part of this shift, and whether or not this can be considered positive is debatable. Students would benefit from distance learning, as it would prevent stress related to missing work on absent days, prepare students more directly for the new form of college curriculum, and allow for a much more relaxing learning environment, creating a much more conducive environment for the practice of education.

The prevention of missing work due to absent school days would greatly reduce the amount of stress a student may encounter during the course of their educational experience. When the possibility of illness or simply generally unexpected events threaten to force a student into absence, many assume that this would be a good thing. The unscheduled days off are seen as a time in which the students only relax, and grant the student extra time to make up work or projects. However, this is a rather unfortunate misunderstanding. After all, if the subject which they were planning to attend to was so benign that they could actively relax, then they would have just gone to school instead, and those that would take leave without a valid excuse were most likely not coming to school anyway. This forced delay in students learning schedule can be incredibly crippling to a student's success, especially for students in their later years of high school, as the enormous spike in difficulty of material necessitates that the student be present for every class and lecture, while missing even one of these can set them back for the whole year as they attempt to catch up. This leads to oppressive amounts of stress that the student now has to account for in their daily lives, added onto the already copious amounts of anxiety from other sources, such as prospective college hunting and shifts into puberty, that teenagers undergo. The implementation of distance learning would allow students to bypass this roadblock entirely, as the student would move at their own pace and thus be allowed to miss a day or two without major hits to their ability to properly understand the material, and lead to a better overall learning experience as a result.

Preparing students for the newest method of online education by allowing them to experience it firsthand would assist them greatly in their transition into the college scene. As the world has evolved into such a state where technology is present in almost every corner of the classroom, it's not particularly surprising that schools have begun to shift entirely into the cyberspace, with reasons ranging from accessibility to ease of implementation. It is becoming more and more common that students will have at least one class in college which will be taken exclusively online, and this can be rather debilitating for some. While some students most certainly thrive in this sort of environment, others who have only experienced the traditional classroom setting can struggle greatly with the online classroom experience, which dictates that they must be self-disciplined enough to perform the work which their teacher had previously forced them to do. Adding onto the fact that moving from high school to college is such a challenging time for most people and that learning how to adapt to a fully digital curriculum is the least of their worries, student are then placed in the unfortunate situation in which they get set on the backfoot right from the beginning, due to struggling with the online environment. By implementing online classes earlier into the high school curriculum, student would be allowed to better understand what is necessary for someone to succeed in a classroom which relies on their own ability to self-regulate habits, and lead to an overall more manageable college experience.

Learning in the comfort of their own home or favorite relaxing space can allow for students to better concentrate on the material as a whole, and create an environment where students are more inclined to study the lessons on a deeper level. While the idea of creating a more comfortable environment can seem almost counter intuitive in regards to a person's ability to learn, considering how some people may just take to slacking off, the effects for those who wish to learn are potentially enormous. Due to the almost inevitable fate of school to be a place loathed by an overwhelming majority of students, it is difficult to find a spot in which a student can be truly comfortable without the physical manifestation of their worries literally looming over their head. This overall decreases a student's ability to learn and can lead to a generally negative impression of the practice in general, even stunting the student's desire to learn in the long run. With students able to correlate their learning experience with a place that they find most comfortable, their impression of the experience would undoubtedly increase, and nourish their interest in the experience overall.

As the world continues to evolve with every passing year into a form practically indistinguishable from its previous iterations, the shift from physical learning to digital is no longer a probability but rather a certainty of the present Age of Information. The classroom as a whole is soon to become a centerpiece in that change, and its role in shaping the next generation of individuals is hard to deny. It's change into an online setting leans more towards being a positive effect, as its ability to better prepare students and lessen stress creates a much healthier base on their journey to pursue a higher education, and life in general.
