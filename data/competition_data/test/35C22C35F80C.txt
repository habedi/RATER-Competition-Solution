Phones & driving

Many people have different opinions about cellphone use while driving. In my opinion I don't think that is should be allowed to do.

There are many accidents caused by people texting and driving according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging, so in that being said it is really dangerous for people to be using their cellphone while driving because you cant see where you are going and you are being entertained on your phone than looking for what is actually happening in the road. For example if you are driving while texting and the light turns red and you don't see that because you are texting then there is a high chance that you are going to be involved in an accident. It is extremely dangerous to text while driving because it could mean jail time or you could possibly hurt someone. In georgia there is this new law that if the police see you using your cellphone you could get pulled over for it. Everyone just don't use your cellphone while on the road and if it's an emergency pull over to a side or go stop at a nearby place but not while driving.
