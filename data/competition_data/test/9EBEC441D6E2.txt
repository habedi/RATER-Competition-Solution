The development of these cars have both many posituve and nevative things to them. They can really help the future in ways that kigjt nkt be possible at this time. In my opinion i tyink that these cars would be a bad idea, because there are mire bad thungs that could happen than good things.

Some people might just say they are good for the future without knowing the consequences for any possible accidents.

One reason why these cars would not be good woukd be if there is an old person that can not drive they could consider one of these cars. The problem is that if it is time for the driver to take over the car and if the driver does not know how to drive, this would lead to a problem. Accidents could occur if non drivers are in the car. It could lead to a critical stage of punishment in case you are in a fatal crash or get stopped by the police.

My other argument is that these cars could potentially stop working if they do not have proper items for this car.

Most people arent going to have the right things for this car, if they crash the car might not function the same and proper way of how its supposed to work. This car could break down for no reason.

I feel like these cars would be more helpful in some way but you also need to look at the negative things of this. Every positive thing always has a negative thing also.

There are going to be consequences if the car is not used right. It might not be affordable for most people either.
