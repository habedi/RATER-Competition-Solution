Using technology that reads emotions in a student classroom is good because its caculates emotion, recognize subtle facial movements, and can mirror a suggested emotion. According to the text, it states by weighing different units the software can identify mixed emotions. Like they use the Mona Lisa picture to measure mixed emotion and she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, well at least thats what the computer software says. The software can also recognize subtle facial movements like if you smile when an ads apears they computer will send similar ads and if you frown then they will change the ad. Then it's good for students because the computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. That means it would modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. If the computer can act like a human bein that would be good because most human communication is nonverbal. Also the computer can mirror a suggested emotion. The computer knows a face that looks happy. The computer knows the muscular action units of the face. Like the article says "you tighten your lips to show anger", that is the same angry face that could be used to a video game. So, yes this type of technology would be great to use in a school because it calculates emotion, recognize facial movements, and could mirror imagery.
