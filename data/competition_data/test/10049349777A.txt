It is important for students to continue learning over summer because they are out of school for a couple months. By assigning a project/projects, this continues their education while on break. It should be up to the teachers to design projects because it gives students a good idea on what they should be doing, so students do not struggle with finding a topic/idea on what to do. Teachers assigning a project can also contribute to lead students to learn material that will help them for their new classes when school starts back up. Most teacher-designed projects will give students options on what they could do for it. Having a student-designed project may lead to extra stress, not knowing what to do, and students forgetting about it or giving up.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed so students have a good idea on what they should be doing for their project. Most summer projects are teacher-designed so students do not have to struggle with figuring out what it should be on. For example, if there was a student who was going to head into an AP Language Arts class for their junior year, a teacher should design a project by giving an outline on what their project should be like. If a student were to design a project without the help from a teacher it could be hard and a struggle for students, to figure out what it should be on. With the help from a teacher to design a project students are more likely to succeed on it.

Another factor in a teacher designing a project would be, giving students a majority of options. This would be helpful for students so, they do not have to think long and hard about what their project should be on. Including this for a teacher-designed outline could be a very helpful factor when students have to pick what it should be on. For example, if a student were to do a project for science and they have to study something for Biology, having options on what they should study and look for while creating a project would be helpful and easy on the students. Having a teacher design a project will also contribute when leading students on the track to what they are going to learn about in the new school year.

Having a teacher-designed project can contribute to students having to do a project that will be an overview for what they will be learning in the new school year. Students should have a little insight on what they will be learning in their new class. An example of this would be, a student who decided to take Astronomy, this student has no idea what he will be learning about in this class. A teacher designs a project so that students can learn a little about this class before they enter it, by creating a research project. This will contribute to students learning about the class because they will have to read about Astronomy, find sources, and more. If a student were to design their own project it could lead to it being not enough, them barely learning anything, and just being not really complete, how a teacher might of wanted it.

If students were held accountable for designing a project there are many downsides. Students tend to not always complete or even start summer projects. This is why many teachers design their own projects so it puts pressure on the students to complete it. Some students rush near the end of summer and during the beginning of the school year to complete it. Students are young and although some can be responsible and accountable for what they are told to do, a minority continue each year not willing or try to do their summer projects. Having a teacher-designed project will help students complete it as told, by giving students a good idea on what they should do for their project, have a majority of options on what they could do, and help contribute to lead students to learn material for their new classes when the school year starts.Â
