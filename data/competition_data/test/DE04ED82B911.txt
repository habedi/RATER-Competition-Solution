Distance learning would not improve student's education. Many are enlightened by the idea of staying home rather than going to school; however, their level of education would greatly suffer. Lacking a physical pressence in class alone detereriorates one's learning ability. As a high school student myself, It would be saddening to walk into classes filled with artificial machines everyday.

Faucilty and staff are constantly complaining about how distracting cell phones are for students in class; but could you imagine how distacted students would be if they took classes from home? Their attention would not be directed at the class; rather Netflix, food, or videogames. Typically, teachers could hold students accountable for their actions and choices; however, they lose that accountablility if they are not in class. Students are more engaged when their are physically in class, allowing them to grasp information effectivly and become smarter. Also, they can spend time with their friends and classmates, developing teamwork and effective communication.

A growing trend, with students, over several years has been laziness. Today, many students fail to complete their homework, take guided notes, or even attend class. Instead, they simply take a nap or juul in the bathroom. Enabling students to skip school entirely is the epitimy of lazy and will cause them to develop bad habits. Although one benefit of staying at home is that students can avoid germs and sickness, there are many germs at home and there is a physical nurse at school.

In conclusion, distance learning is a terrible idea. It would negativly impact student's learning abilitys and enable them to develop bad habits. Staying at home enables students to become distacted and not connect with the classroom. School systems should continue to operate normally to benefit the students.Â
