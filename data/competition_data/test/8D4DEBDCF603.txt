Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this letter to tell you about students doing community service. If the students wants to participate in doing community service they can, but the others don't have to participate if they don't want to. The students should participate in community service because its shows how much students cares about their community. For example, students should collect recycling like bottles, canes, glasses and card board. The students should collect these items and put them in a blue bag that stands for recycling. The students can wait while the recycling collectors do their job.

Another example, how students can be required to perform community service collecting garbage like paper, tissues, and other thing that are garbage material. They can put them in a black garbage bag. The students can also wait for the garbage collectors to com and take the bags the students collected. I will love to see my community very clean. Our students should care about their community and participate.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
