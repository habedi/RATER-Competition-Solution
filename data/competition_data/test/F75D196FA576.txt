For a while now, driverless cars have a been a debated topic. People everywhere have varying opinions on the use of driverless cars. Some argue that it is an unsafe way of transportation, while others say it's a much easier, more efficent way of getting where you need to go. I personally believe that driverless cars are just as safe as your average non-driverless car and should be allowed.

As stated in "Driverless Cars Are Coming", the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake all by themsleves, just as a human could. When in need of human assistance, in bad traffic, arround accidents, or around construction zones, the car's seat will vibrate, have lights flash, other headlight displays, or even announce that the driver needs to prepare to take control of the car. The cars have sensors that require the human driver be alert and watching the road at all times, which would prevent accidents, proving it to be just as safe as a non-driverless car, if not more. Not only is it just as safe, it is far more efficent. The sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and even reduce power from the engine, which allows response and control better than a human driver could ever portray driving. The sensors also detect and respond to dangerous spurs, such as out-of-control skids or rollovers. Once again, portraying how safe the driverless cars really are. More advancements in the sensors are leading to cars that can handle more and more various driving tasks on their own.

Driverless cars are an extremely safe way of getting places on a daily basis. From their special alerts to their sensors that have "drivers" aware at all times to their more efficent way of breaking and reducing wear and tear on your engine, how could anyone think a non-driverless car could be any better? I bet if we all had a driverless car, driving would be a less-dreaded, much safer way of getting where you need to go!
