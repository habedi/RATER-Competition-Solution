Although exploring Venus would be dificult, it would add enormous amounts of knowledge about the possibility of other life forms. However, none of the spacecrafts that have arrived at Venus had a long life span. In order to send humans to Venus, NASA needs to find out how to get through Venus's hefty atmosphere. The author presumes that if NASA can get people to Venus though, the rock and air samples would conclude if our alien counterparts had once thrived there.

Despite Venus's toxic atmosphere and unhabitable heat that is currently present, the author stated that, years ago, Venus was likely to be covered in large oceans that could have supported many different life forms. Astronomers see that Venus is very equatible to Earth. With its rocky surface, valleys, mountains, and craters. The idea of Venus being so alike has brought greater attention to the thought of sending humans to the planet. Nasa had planned to hover over the thick atmosphere of Venus, but the results of that would be imennsely limited because they would never break the atmosphere.

Overall, Nasa has found that Venus will be stupendously hard to study, but worth it to start thinking of the possiblities. With the intense heat and pressure in mind they have not yet found a way to land humans, or even small spacecrafts, on the planet. But human curiosity will lead us into many intimidating endeavors.
