We should definitely change the school policy! Having a B average to get into sports seems like the right thing to me! First of all, having a C average is not a good grade to me. Second, A sport is a privilege, and if all it takes to go for a sport is to get a B average, I think that us kids are smart enough and willing enough to get B' s. Also, most kids do wan' t to go for sports, so they would get B' s and it would look better for our school.

First, a C average is not that impressive to too many people unless they are known for getting even lower.

Getting B' s is not all that difficult if you pay attention. I feel that kids who have a C average are not giving their all in their work. I also think us kids would be prouder if we got B' s!

Second, we should be pretty great kids to get into sports! I mean, sports are privileges and getting good grades should be the reason we get into sports! It would make us work just a little bit more hard in class if someone told us that getting B' s is what it takes. And all it takes to get a B is paying attention and actually studying. In 8th grade we should definitely be able to get B' s.

Lastly, a lot of kids want to go for sports, so a lot would end up getting B' s. For our school to be a B average school would be a great achievement! and if all kids needed to do was to get C' s, then we would, and we would be a C school. I think being a B over a C school is much better!

Think of how many B' s we would get if that's what we needed to get into sports!

So my answer is yes! Absolutely! to begin with, to me, C' s are not all that great. And second, we are much more intelligent enough to get B' s! And lastly, our school would be much more appreciated if we were a B school. We can handle getting B' s if its for sports!
