Dear Principal,

I think that it is unfair that kids cant have sports or activities the one reason i say this is because sports and activities is not stopping kids to learn. I think if you take away sports it will hurt children because if the kid would like to be a football, basketball, soccer player he/she couldn't achieve that goal because the school is taking away sports and activities. I think that you should have these sports but kids with a d-f should not be able to participate in the sport or activity, so if a child is really interested he/she will step up and do what he/she can do to improve his/her grade. When your a student you just want to express yourself and have time off to join sports and games. Kids enjoy this and if you take this opportunity away from them they will be very upset. Sports and activities can also help you get into the college you would like to go to because when a child is joining a sport lots of college professors want to see that. Another thing i would like to point out is that lots of kids would like to have a prep rally and see there friends and family play that sport. Sense i am a student here i would dislike not having to play sports or do activities. When kids play a sport it takes there stress away and hypes them up so taking a sport opens there minds. Children this age just want fun and games so i do think this might be to much credit for them but it still wont be fair for the students not being able to become what they want to be when there older, Also being a student your in school for about eight hours and after school people would enjoy doing what they love and go to there sports and or activities. I would like to say thank you for your time and effort i hope you understand.
