Dear Principal,

Over the years, your students having been growing up and maturing.

You have helped us do this, but now, it is our turn to make our own decisions.

I believe we should not be required to take part in community service.

Your students work hard throughout the school year with not only class work but with home activities and several others that may require our time.

We should be able to take part in community service at our own free will.

Not as a requirement.

At home, we as students may have several older brothers or sisters.

Our parents work hard to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table for all the siblings to share.

The least we can do is stay home to watch after everyone, but there would be less time to do that if we have to do community service.

It is time consuming for other important things like house hold chores and adding memories to our siblings lives by being there for them.

We are your children.

You have watched us grow and tumble through hard situations.

We do not want to want to do something if you made it a requirement.

We need the freedom of making that choice for ourselves if it is or is not something we want to do.

Life is full of choices.

What to wear in the morning or what to watch on television?

These are both things we decide every day.

Now, this is our decision to either help or not.

You will be taking our right away to make our own decisions if you make community service a requirement.

You have taken your students through leaps and bounds, but now, your students will prove to you that we can make our own decisions including the decision to take part in community service.

Our time is occupied by hard class work and extra curricular activities.

At home, there may have to help and stay home due to the family.

We want to be free to make the decision, but we don't want to participate because it was required to do so.

We are free to make the choice of participating in community service.
