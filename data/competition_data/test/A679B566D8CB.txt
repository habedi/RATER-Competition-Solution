Dear principle

I think its a very good idea to make the students of our school perform community service.

It could teach them a valuable lesson and maybe there will be less violence in this world.

Maybe we could have less murders, robberies, and maybe even less teen pregnancies.

It could teach them that their is more in this world then television and computers.

we could help everyone in the world. We could help them with we could help the homeless find shelter and food, we could visit the nursing homes to keep the elderly company make them feel better about themselves. Anything to find a way to help the people in this world.

The children who help this project could help make this world a better place. help the people in this world have a better place to live.

If we all work together than we could make a huge difference in this world for ourselves and everyone else.

The earth gave us a home and now its time to give back to the Earth. Helping the earth is very important and we all need to take care of our home.
