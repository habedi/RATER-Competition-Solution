Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand that as an experienced teacher you may see that many students are making a C average, but does that really mean that you have to take away our sports and activities? There could be many young athletes that you don't even know exist, therefore you should not take away the privileges of young future athletic scholars.

These sports also could relieve stress for some of the students. By you taking their ability to relieve stress away they may even do worst in school and you're going to wonder why. I believe that students who score at least a 75% should attend sports, but by making only B average attend is not fair in my eyes. These students may have a lot on their mind minds as far as school comes , but there are athletes sitting right in the classrooms not doing anything , BECAUSE they cant attend any athletic activities.

I do understand that as a principle you may see something completely different. Just think about if you were a student, how would you feel if you got the only thing you love to do taken away because you have a 79% percent? This is why I argue that students should be aloud to attend any sport they'd like because they have a 75% average or higher in all of they're classes.

All in all please consider not making this a required rule.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
