Throughout my adolescent past, I've had a vigorous number of summer assignments. Whether it was a Algebra 1 packet or a summer reading assignment, teachers never fail to overwhelm there students with work before the year even begins. Most summer assignments are enforced by the teachers and lack any student input. A majority of students show little interest in the assignments they are presented and approach the work with a negative attitude rather than optimism. Although a student-designed summer project is a chance for students to exhibit there work in a more enjoyable fashion, a teacher-designed project would work better because teachers understand what work will best prepare students and shows the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.

A reason why teachers should design the projects is because they understand what work will best prepare students. Many teachers have attained an advanced education in there subject. Unlike the students, the teacher knows exactly what the course will consist of, and the level of difficulty that they will cover. In most classes, students start the year with no prior knowledge of the subject they will cover. An example of there unpreparedness is that large portions of high school students switch out of classes because they don't know the level of the work that they will be covering. A student led project could be void of any important information. If they find an area of the subject thats more difficult than the others, they could address that area more than another part of the subject. Assignments created by teachers would be a prime opportunity for teachers to demonstrate the work they will cover, and help a student drop the class if the work seems too challenging. A summer assignment is before the year starts, so switching your classes wouldn't interrupt your school year.

Another reason teachers should design the projects is because it shows what type of assignments will follow in the future. Teachers are a people of habit. Throughout the year, they will assign projects that are very similar to each other, following similar guidelines. An example of repetition in school is teachers assigning a variation of slide show presentations. Throughout the school year, many teachers conduct slide show presentations within new concepts. If a student were to design the summer project, it could be an entirely different format then any format suggested by a teacher. With the teacher in control, they could give you a project very similar to one that you may face in the future.

Many believe that if enjoy what your doing, than you will be more productive. A student getting to choose what type of project they will do could introduce the topic in more exciting manner. While enjoying what you do is important, it may also not prepare a student to the best of it's capabilities. A student led project may not cover the ground that it needs to cover. For example, the students could decide to write a one paragraph reflection on an area of the subject that they found interesting. The problem with that format is that it may only tackle a small portion of the subject, and you wouldn't be able to reflect on what others found interesting, which would help you remember the information better.

The teachers should design the project that the students work on. They know what work will best to prepare students and help them succeed. Teachers understand the subject far greater than any student designing the project. A more rigorous area of the subject could be addressed more in the project. If the teacher creates all of the future projects, than the summer project could reflect the type of projects teachers will assign in the future. Repetition is prominent within classrooms, and a summer assignment created by the teacher could offer incite into future projects. With a student in control of the project, they may only address a small area of the subject that will come up later in the year. While a student-designed summer project can make there work more enjoyable, a teacher-designed project would be better for students, because teachers understand what will prepare them best and is a way to discover the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.
