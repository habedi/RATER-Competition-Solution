Dear Principle,

All though you think that is a good idea, ask yourself, "What will be the effect of this decision?". Me myself have an A average and am in the top of my class, but even I do not believe that this is a good idea. If you do this no-one will care, I mean why should they if they are barely maintaining a C average just to play sports and impress their parents. For that reason then what makes you think they will keep trying.

Taking away the only thing kids enjoy about school, is very bad they would probably just drop out. You're the one that caused all of this then you would be the one to blame. There would probably not even be enough kids for a full team, you would loose everything the kids actually liked about school, you will loose your players, and most importantly you would probably loose your job.

That is why you should not make students have a grade B average to perform in extracurricular activities. Now I hope you make the right choice.

P.S.

Would it even be legal for one school in a district to have that law instead of all of them?

Sincerely,

Mystery Student
