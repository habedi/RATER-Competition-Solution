Are Phones a problem

Do you think the driver of a car should be allowed to use his/her phone while driving? When it comes to being allowed to have a phone behind the wheel a lot of things must come into play before it can be considered a good idea. There are a lot more cons to something like this than there are pros but the pros should definitely be taken into consideration. The best way to figure out if it is a good idea is to know everything someone requires to drive at full capacity. What we will cover is the pros and cons of drivers being allowed to use their phones while behind the wheel.

First I would like to talk about the cons of something like this being allowed. Cell phone usage while driving is common but it is really considered dangerous due to the potential of causing distracted driving and crashes. Many agree that use of cell phones while driving is pervasive. "Drivers on a cell phone reduce their visual scanning of the road ahead, and are more likely to weave within their lane on bends, and are slower to respond to hazards."

As stated in the text above if drivers take their eyes off of the road it is more than likely they will have accidents.

As I said before there are a lot more pros to phones being allowed to be used behind the wheel. Cell phones allow users to call for immediate help when needed and cell phones allow people to have directions for when they cannot find their destinations. Many local governments provide traffic updates for people with cell phones so that they can try to avoid traffic making their trip quicker. Cell phones also allow users to immediately call the police to report suspicious actions they see while driving. With all this being taking into account there are some good things that can be achieved allowing drivers the use of their cell phones.

In conclusion, I would say there are some benefits to being able to use cell phones while driving but the chances of an accident happening significantly increase at an alarming rate. Do I think drivers should be allowed cell phone use? I do believe they should be allowed but only when they are not at risk of putting themselves or anyone in harm's way. Although studies show that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. I purpose that drivers should not be allowed to text while driving but everything else of course.
