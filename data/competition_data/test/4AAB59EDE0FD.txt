Dear principal,

I've been hearing that you are thinking of whether to require students to perform community service and I personally think that it's a great idea. I agree on requiring all the students in our school to perform community service. Maybe I can turn your, maybe into a, yes.

Students are always up to no good during their own time. Not all the students, but some are. Most of them are out maybe doing drugs or involved in gangs, or maybe even stealing. students need to get away from all that and community service would be a great way to get them out of that. They need to learn that there is other people out there that need their help and instead of thinking about themselves, and doing bad things, they should be out there helping them, doing something good for somebody else besides themselves.

Community service is also another way to bring students and people together. Sometimes kids don't talk or know each other and maybe they don't seem to like each other, and I think a great way to bring everybody together is by helping our community and helping one another. We can make new friends while helping our community.

Another good reason to require community to all the students is to make our community a better and safer place. We can start by picking up litter from the streets and the freeways to not pollute the planet and make it a better community to live in so more people would want to come and live here, that will definitely help. We can stop global warming by ; picking up trash, throwing away our trash, recycling, everything. Students have a big part in that because most students don't really and seem to throw their trash on the floor and some don't even bother picking it up, they always have that habit, but only if they can see how it's harming the earth. Requiring all the students to do community service can also help our school, other schools can look up to us and follow in our foot steps and make a community a better place a long with us.
