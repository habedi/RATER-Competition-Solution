In the article, the author's main idea is that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In my opinion the author moderately supports his idea from the article. the author says that Venus is the most Earth-like planet form the solar system, the author refers to traveling to Venus as a "challenge", he also says that humans are coming up with ideas to surpass the radical conditions from Venus.

To begin, on paragraph 4 the author says that Venus is the most Earth-like planet, and it has alike characterisitcs with the Earth. The author says that Venus has some features that are analogous to those on earth, and includes familiar features such as valleyr, mountains, and catrers. The author gives the similarities between the Earth and Venus as one of the reasons to study Venus.

In addition, on paragrah 3 the author describes Venus like an inhospitable place for humans. In Venu's surface the temperatures average is over 800 degrees, also the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater that the Earth's pressure. The author says that the conditions on Venus are far more radical than anything humas encounter on Earth. All those descriptions are dangers from the "pursuit of Venus" .

Finally, the Author says that humans are having ideas to protect themselves from the conditions in Venus. In paragraph 7 says that NASA is testing their devices made of silicon in a chamber to simulate the chaos of Venus's surface, and the devices have lasted for three weeks those conditions. Also, they are working to look back to mechanical computers, and they compare those computers with modern computers. They say that mechanincal computers are more resistant than modern computers. In summary, the author says that human are working on devices to face the conditions in Venus.

In conclusion, the author supported his idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers with several points in the article.
