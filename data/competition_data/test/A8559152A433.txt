See I was so excited for playing sports. My dream is to be one of the best basketball girl stars. I am really good in sports but I have a "C" average in school. Sadly we have to have a "B" average in school. To be honest if u have a "C" average you are still passing. So I really don't understand why you can't have a "C" average to play sports.

Its not like were not trying our hardest. If we were not trying our hardest we would have D' s or F' s. No one isn't perfect after all. I really like sports and I dislike how we cant play no more if we make less then a B. Usually when kids can't play sports no more they stop trying to learn. They immediately give up on life. when you lower it down to a "C" average the sport players avoid trying to get D' s and F' s. But to some it's hard making a "B" average.

I mostly guarantee If you change it to a "C" average more people would try to bring there D' s and F' s up. Because they could be able to believe in their self more of bringing their grade up to a "C" average. So why don't you give it a try
