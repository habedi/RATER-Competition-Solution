Summer is the time of the year most people enjoy. Students usually enjoy this time the most. However, there is one thing that can completely ruin it. Summer projects, something most kids would cry if they heard they had to do them. Most students show hatred towardsÂ them because it takes away from their favorite time of the year, summer! Most students forget or just chose not to complete them. Summer projects were created to keep students learning during long breaks. Teacher's usually assign these students topics. However, I believe if you give students the responsibility of choosing their own projects they would strive to complete them and mature mentally as young adults should. Student-designed projects see more completion, interest, and improvement than the average assignment. I, as a student, would want control over my project. I typically do not do as well with teacher topics as well as some of my other fellow students.

When teachers design their summer projects they use topics that fit into the lesson plan or that interest them personally. This is not fair to the student. If a student received a topic that they hated they would, more than likely, fail that project. There are a lot students who would toughen up and do the project, but most students are not like that. They will put in minimal effort towards the project just enough to pass if that. This effects grades and does not show a students true ability to perform outside the learning environment.

Humans grow in controlled situations. We as the students should be given that opportunity to grow by controlling our project. If students chose their own topics there would show a lot more effort in completion of the project. This improves the want to learn, has a better effect on grades, and learning mentality improves tremendously. Students would take more time for better results and show select skills taught by teachers, which is what teachers want to see.

I believe student-designed is the way to go. Giving us the power also gives us motivation to do it. I strive when I can do research on things I like or have a slight interest in. It is a completely different experience when you can learn about what you want to versus being in a classroom forced to learn about boring topics. For example, the American Revolution or chemical equations. By giving us topics were at an automatic disadvantage with a 32% higher chance of failure.

In other words, students have better performance with self-liked topics. Teacher-designs typically get less attention and a lot more failures from students. Finally, if you want better results from your students give them a little power every now and then. We strive in those situations made by ourselves contrasted to the ones picked out for us.
