Dear principle,

I think that policy one is better. I think this because what if the kid had a family emergency or had an appointment with the doctor and it's a kid that forgets a lot and his mom was just reminding him. The lunch period is the period were you have a lot of free time to do what ever you want and talk with your friends that moved. There are no teachers at lunch to watch you, so you won't get caught. If you use your phone during class you well sure to be caught. Also if you use your phone in the halls you could fall and get really injured or bump into someone. If you had a test the next day and in your class your not reviewing for your test and your on the phone so much you could fail and your parents will get very upset. What if your on the phone on the stairs and you trip and don't get up people won't notice you and they will the one tripping. If you had a project due and your suppose to study and learn about that subject, but if someone was on there phone they wouldn't pay attention to the book and they should get caught for using the phone in the library when the library is suppose to be quiet, but when your in the lunch room your not going to annoy people because everyone's talking. What if one parents are really sick and about to die and they die and your in school and your in the middle of class and your parents calls, but the teacher says to not pick it up, but then they try calling back at lunch and you pick up and your parent are mad and they start yelling at you and you said that you can't pick up the phone during class. That's what I think policy one is better than policy two.
