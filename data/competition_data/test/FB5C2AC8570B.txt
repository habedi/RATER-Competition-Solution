Hello my name is Luke I think you guys should join the program because its fun you can even join when you are out of high school. A man came up to me at one of my jobs and asked if I wanted to do it so I had to say yes because I knew it would be fun to do. You also get to travel places with the other cowboys. We do this to help the countries in Europe that got destroyed in World War II recover. We help them get thier animals food supplies.

44 other nations helped us and all together. we made something called UNRRA that stands for United Nations Relief and Rehibitation Administation. Thats were I come in the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses and cattle and mules so me and Don signed up. If you turn 18 when you are a Seagoing Cowboy you can be drafted to the military services but they might tell you to keep doing the Seagoing Cowboy for a service. I even got to see Europe, China, Greece, Italy and more.

It made me aware on other countries and their needs. It was also fun to be on board. I got to play table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games that passed time. I think you should join to and do all of the fun things I did. You will learn a lot of things. You will aslo learn about other people and not thinkig about yourself.
