In the article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile," We now know it's possible, and thanks to the latest innovation in the technology world to Proffesor Thomas Hauang it could be sooner than we think. This new software, known as the Facial Action Coding System, is able to read your emotional expressions which is shown to be very promising to the educational system. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vauble becasue it could regonize if a student is bored or confused, it could also modify the lesson in order for the student to learn better.

And prefaces by stating, "If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent." If applied in the educational sence this could mean that the computer could see the students is confused and be able to spend more time trying to help that student comprehend the material. The computer could also modify the lesson.

Additionally, If that doesn't work then it could always modify the lesson in a way the student could get a better meaning of it.
