Dear principal,

I would prefer if you choose policy 1.

The reason why I would like policy 1, is because we are never aloud to have our phones out at the school day; although a lot of kids do anyway. I would like it because i would be at lunch and free times and what's the big deal about that? It's not like we would be hurting anybody. the only trouble would be if you dropped it and someone stepped on it, or if you left it on the table and somebody took it. Although if someone took it would be your fault.

For an example what if you forgot your gym clothes or your lunch money? If you had your cell phone then you would be able to call a mom or dad or anybody to pick up your stuff and bring it to the school. Or if you had an F in a certain class, and you left your project that would get you a B in that class, you could call someone to drop it off.

The bad thing about it though is that you probably never be concentrated on any of your classes or maybe just about anything. Another bad thing is that if you have any kind of text that day, you could go onto your phone or the internet on your phone and get the answer, plus if you get caught you would be in really big trouble, you would fail the test, and your teachers probably not trust you forever, or atleast for a long time. I just listed some bad thing, but remember in the beginning of the letter I listed a whole bunch of good stuff? That is what you need to focus on the most, not the bad stuff. Also i bet that a lot of kids would agree with me when i tell you this; teenagers need their cell phones or they will die.

well not actually but the thing is to a lot people's lives, their cell phone is like their lives. and without it, they will fall apart

I just do not see a lot of bad things about cell phones. Well that is about all I have to say. Take care and please try to think this whole thing through, THE END.
