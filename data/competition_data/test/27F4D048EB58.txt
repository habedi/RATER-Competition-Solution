Dear principal,

I think that you should do policy one (allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned of during class time.) One reason is because what if something happened to one of our family members and they don't have the school numbers so they need to get a hold of us and we don't have our phones on us. Second reason is we have after school activities that we attend on a daily bases or just a few times a week but we wont be able to reach our parents to come pick us up after it is done because the office is always closed after that at that time so we can not use the office phone. Third reason is it might help kids come to school because most the kids get bored at school and need something to do so if you made it so they were able to have there phones on free time they would say man if I go to school I can get my work done and then I have free time to use my phone then there would be no question why kids aren't coming to school and that person will keep there grades up better.

But if you make it so they can't have them then people are still going to bring them and parents won't be able to get a hold of there kids. There would be a bunch of confusion in parents not knowing when to come and get there kid from school then parents wouldn't let there kids do after school activities and then the school would not make a profit for extra things they need to make our school better. Therefore you should use policy one because it just make the school a better place for students and more fun and just eliminates all the confusion between parents and children.
