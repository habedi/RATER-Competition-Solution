I believe that the face is just a natural landform. There are no facts to prove that aliens created that. Also there are also no facts to prove aliens didnt make that landform on Mars. I will still continue to believe that it is just a natural landform created by the planet Mars in earlier years.

I can prove my arguement in many ways. For example, it states in the text that " And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform". Just that last sentence alone can make my arguement 10 times better. That statement proves to us it was just a natural landform. In addition to this, in the article it states " there was no alien monument after all.". Which tells us there was never alien monument and that never was made by aliens.

As you can see in the picture, it looks pretty old. Which should really show everyone something. The photo as taken in 1976. With our newer, more advanced cameras it shows that its just a natural landform on Mars. In the article it states that " As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you can see wwhat they were!". Which means if we really wanted to, we can capture a picture of the so called "face" or natural landform. Also then we would be able to prove what it is and what it is not.

There are many other reasons why this arguement can be won by either side, but there is never a true answer until someone goes onto the planet Mars and takes a look at the face or landform in person. in fact, I will always stand my ground and say it is just a natural landform on Mars.
