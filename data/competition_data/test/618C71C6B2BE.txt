well if i would get good grades i would like to join in sports. i like sports, i like to play basketball, football, baseball and soccer. but if i would like to join in sports you have to get good grades and passing on all your classes. but if your on a sport and you don't have good grades, you can't play your sport anymore. but i could tell you this if you want to go back to that sport your playing you have to have good grades and passing on all your classes then you could go back and play your sport. but if you don't have good grades and you want to go back and your arguing with your principal you could have an after school d hall or an write up or something else that keeps you away from the arguing. but if you don't argue with your principle than you could go back to your sport but you have to get good grades and by passing on all your classes. i don't like to argue with the principle and i want to keep my grades up because i want to pass on all my classes and i want to get good reports. i like school because it helps me to learn different stuff. i would like to play basketball for a sport. i play a lot with my causings
