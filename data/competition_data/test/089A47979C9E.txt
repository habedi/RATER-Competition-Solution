I would say that planning a trip to Venus is a worthy idea and pursuit because scientists can go there and collect samples of rocks and gases. They could be able to see things and stuff they have never seen before. The problem would be that scientists and explorers would probably not be able to return back to Earth to examine the samples because Venus's Surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and they won't be able to survive on the surface for a long period of time.

Inseead of using electronics, we can use mechanical computers which are more ridgid and less fragile in extreme weather and environment conditions. These mechanical computers are worthy because they were used in World War II. These mechnical computers were made to withstand the extreme of weather and environmental conditions.

Some examples include the following, " A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide covers Venus". "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere". "On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet".
