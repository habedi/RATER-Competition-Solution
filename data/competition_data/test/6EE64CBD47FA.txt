Should an extracurricular activity be mandatory? Now I know what your thinking, "Mandatory!? No way!", but hear me out. If activities such as working on the year book or playing soccer were required students would learn to manage their time better, be more productive, and maybe even find there future career. Let me explain.

Productivity, a very important characteristic to have. Whether you're exercising or doing your homework, you are being productive. But how can extracurricular activities help? For starters, sports get your body moving and keep you in-shape. If I play basket ball I'm being Productive, as posed to sitting at home on social media all day. However, sports are not the only way to be productive. Activities like working on the year book help your academic productivity and social productivity. Socializing with people to get the yearbook made or talking to people to find out what to put in it, is social productivity. Wile with academic productivity, you could do any number of things that challenge you brain. Productivity is also a key characteristic when people are picking candidates for colleges and future employees.

Speaking of colleges and future employment, If students were required to do some form of extracurricular activity, they may find a hidden talent or expand upon the ones they already have. Let's pretend that you don't know what you want to do with your life and are unaware of anything that you could do; your school requires you to do some form of extracurricular activity, you join the school news paper and really like it and boom! Future journalist. Even if It's nothing like that, studies have shown that you are more likely to be chosen for a collage if you do an extracurricular activity. The fact of the matter is that someone who can balance there life with extra things is more eligible than someone who dose not do anything and has straight A's.

Which brings me to my final point, time management. What good is an extra activity when you have D's and C's on your report card, or worse? What's the point i\of all of these benefits If you dont learn the most important skill of all? Extracurricular activities aid in the learning of time management. How? They teach you how to balance free time and work. With an extra activity or thin you need to do, it makes it much faster to learn that you should do your homework first and then you can play and goof off.

In conclusion, time management, productivity, and career exploration are just some of the many benefits of extracurricular activities. These skills will stick with you your entire life. So remember to go out and find an extracurricular activity, and if you already have one, one more couldn't hurt.
