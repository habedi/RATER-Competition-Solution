Cars are a life line and much used tool for people on day to day commutes. Can we live without i? In Vauban Germany there is a town that does not own one car. How do they get around then? They city trans and running. the reason is the cars are spouing out tons of green gasses. Its not only in Vauban either. This is a trend world wide in most suburbs.

Does everyone agree with this no car trend? After Paris recived a near record pollution they banned driving in the city. On some days the city would allow odd licence plates. On other days the city would allow even number plates. Near 4,000 drivers were given a 31$ (22-euro) fine. This cleared the smog over a period of time. What was the effect on the city after words? Smog cleared from the city vassly but. Citizens were able to freely use the transit without cost. There wwere acceptions to plug in cars and viecles holding more than three people.

On the other side of the world people in Bogota Colombia created and set a carfree day. On this day people Hiked, Biked, and took buses to destinations. This was a ecelent strategy to promot alternative transportation and reduced pollution for this large city of 7 million. People who did not go along with the day were fined 25$. Now to more close by cities Cali and Valledupar have joined the event. This has been amazing for upcoming local city buissnessis. Also reconstruction on side walks and parks.

What about the largest car loving cuontry, America? Well it seems the trend has effected us as well. Although there are no limits the driving has seemingly cooled over the years. This will be a long term cultral shift with companies like Ford and Mercedes calling hemselves mobility companies. When someone does drop the habbit it is hard to pick up again. Even driving by young people has dropped 23%. These changes have changed the pollution rate and many more car related problems. There mabey a time where traffic jams no longer exist.
