When looking at the Face over the years, you can clearly tell that it's a landform. From 1976 to 2001 the Face has lost almost all features to make it look like a face. For example, in 1976 you could clearly see a nose and eyes. By 1998 you could hardly make out the form of the nose and there was a crack where a mouth would have been bplaced. Finally, by 2001 you could hardly see any of its features. In the following paragraphs I will discuss detalis and characteristics into further detail.

When I took a first looked at the Face, in the photo from 1976, I saw a clear face with a nose, eyes, and the feature of a pharoh.

By 1998 I could no longer see the eyes and nose look caved in. I did however see the form of a mouth that I didn't see before. A martian couldn't make a face out of the ground because nobody knows for sure that they're real. No one has ever seen a martian so how do we know that they're even there? Land however could completely make this. If you look at Earth and the mountains that have been formed, not by man but by the land, you know that there's no way martian's could've built this.

Also, nobody has proof that this isn't just shadows reflecting onto the ground. There might not even be a landform there but the shadows are forming an allusion that makes it look like a land mass. In paragraph 9, Garvin says, "We don't just pass over the Face very often." When Garvin says this, it makes me believe more that it's just a shadow because they don't see it very often. The sun might have to be placed just right to cast the shadows onto that specific spot. Lastly, how would martians know what an ancient pharoh looked like?

Now I'm going to sides with the martian's. If martians were in fact a real living thing, why couldn't they build something to look like a face? I'm sure that they would have hands, fingers, feet, and toes just like humans. If this Face was martian made, maybe they were trying to send a signal to someone like, "Hey, we really are here and we need your help!" They could've known that there were space rovers going around their planet from somewhere else. There's no telling who built the Face.

There's no telling how the Face got there or why. The most realistic and logical explanation is that the land formed it. There are many conspiraces out there as to how and why the Face is on Mars. I choose to believe that they had a "Mars Quake" and the face just appeared. But in reality nobody knows how it was formed.
