REASONS STUDENT WILL NOT BENEFIT BY ATTENDING CLASSES FROM HOME

Students are known to be the future leaders of this generation, so in order for them to succed, there need to be some form of hard education. Some students offer home education and some students offer school education due to some problems. And since i care about student education, i am writing this essay to explain why students will not benefit on their education by attending classes in thier home.

To begin with, online education makes students not to pay attention with his or her studies. Some student may be tempted to play online video games, some will also be tempted to watch online video games. Research shows that 70% of students use thier computers ,mobile phone and laptops for social media, video games and youtube. This will lead to students not paying attention on thier work which will lead to low productivity of the students. Students may not achieve thier goals when they start not to pay attention during online studies.

Secondly, due to the abscence of the teacher or supervisor, this will not allow the students to ask questions or understand concepts that they do not understand. But if the student was suppose to be in class, he or she will have the opportunity to ask the teacher questions. Due to this students will not achieve their goals if they do not understand what they are doing.

Lastly,students will not benefit from online or home sudies because home or online studies is tedious and expensive. online studies is tedious due to the fact that you have to go through process by filling in documents and also reasons for online edeucation. Also nobody will help you solve your problems. It is expensive in the sense that you will have to pay for tuition and other bills .

In a nut shell online studies is not better than school studies.Â
