Have you ever been told you have to do something no matter how you feel about it? Well, Generic_Name our principal at Generic_School said we must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with Generic_Name because students may not be in the right state of mind to do something extra, it's unfair for the kids that work hard,and a student's grades can drop dramatically.

Students may have a difficult home life and may not want to open up about it. Staff can't know what goes on outside of school and they dont know everything that goes on in school either. A students grandparent could be dying in a hospital and he has to sit at school with no idea of whats happening until he gets home; this student's not gonna want to go to practice. There going to want to get out of school and spend as much time with his grandparent as he can before he no longer can. If a student is getting bullied there not gonna want to be on a team with a kid there scared of. As fun as extracurricular activities are there not made for everyone.

Its not fair to the kids that want to be in a sport or head of the student council because they work hard to make it on the council or on the team. While the students that don't want to be there are there because it's mandatory. If there's a kid on the basketball team that wants to win the game and go to the state championship is put on a team with a kid that has the attitude of "I am going to go out there and I hope I dont get the ball because I don't want to shot a basket". That is unfair for the student that is trying his hardest, but has to work with people that are just trying to slide by.

An all "A" students grade's can drop to B's and C's from not getting enough sleep. If practice or meetings are not ending till later hours student could be sleep deprived. They may not get to go home seven o'clock at night and they still have to take a shower, eat dinner, and do there homework for school. I remember when I was in theater I would get home and be tried but I still had to do so much homework,Therefore I was staying up til like eleven o'clock at night and having to wake up at seven o'clock in the morning. I became sleep deprived which made me want to fall asleep in class, as a result I wasnt learning as much as I needed to.

I don't agree with

Generic_Name because student might not be in the right mind set, it's unfair to the kids that work hard, it can cause a students grades to drop. I dont think kids should be forced to participate in an activity's they don't want to be in. If the students don't want to do something there not going to try there best to be good at it.

It may be a great experience but it's not for everyone. I think extracurricular activities should be opinion for the student that want it.
