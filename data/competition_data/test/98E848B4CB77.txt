Dear Principle,

Having a policy that requires a athlete to have a B average in order to play sports is the correct decision. As the years progress more and more students are for getting the importance of school work and spending most of there time on sports. If a student really loved sports and they would like to play it they will make an effort to get a B average. Also the principle is preparing for life because it doesn't matter how good you are in sports you will not be able to play if you do not have good grades. Having good grades is the first part of becoming a great athlete. Also the athletes of the school is suppose to be the leaders of the school and they can't lead if they have bad grades. If to look at the word student athlete notice that student comes first. So those are some reasoning why I agree with you year policy.
