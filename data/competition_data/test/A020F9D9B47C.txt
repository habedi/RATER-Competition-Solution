In modern day schools, students are focused on things such as technology more than classwork. Schools across America have adapted to this very quickly and now a lot of class work is done on computers and cellular devices. This advancement has been very beneficial to students and teachers, but because of technology students have begun to lose information faster than ever. Some teachers have even begun to assign projects over the summer time. Students have become very upset that they have to complete school assignments over the summer, therefore some have suggested to let students design these summer projects. It would'nt work out as many would think. Teachers should design summer projects because it will be more educational, better organized, and it will be retained better by students.

Teachers should create these summer projects because it would be more educational. Teachers jobs are to help students gain more knowledge and learn new things. Students just aren't capable of creating a project that helps them retain information over the summer. Even if students were to design the project it would hinder the accuracy of the information there for making it less helpful for them. Teachers could make it more accurate and efficient in helping them keep the information they learned before summer.

Also teachers should design these projects because it will be better organized. Some students aren't even capable of keeping their own room organized so why should school staff let them create an assignment for the summer. Though some teachers may not be the most organized they get the job done. Teachers have a tendency to keep things clean and neat due to them having to know where all of their papers and supplies are. Therefore, students should not design these papers because they are not organized.

Finally, the information they learn from these projects will be retained by students if teachers design them. Over the summer, students would much rather use their cell phones and go to social events than complete a project that helps them retain information over the summer. So, students would most likely design this project to be easy so they can finish it quickly and afterwards do anything they want over the summer. Though teachers could look over these projects and make sure they are educational, it would be much less of a hassle to just let teachers deign it instead of students. After students complete exams and essays at the end of a school they're most likely tired from the whole year full of work they just completed. Yes, it may be stressful but it is very important that students are able to keep this information.

In conclusion, teachers should design summer projects because it will be more educational, better organized, and it will be retained better by students. As shown, students are just not cut to design these assignments. Teachers should design them because it will be more beneficial for students.
