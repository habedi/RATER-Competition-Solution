To the principal:

May you take in mind how glad I am to see that the cell phone policy in our school is going to be changed, in our time it seems that the cell phone is a big part of our lives, it connects us with family and friends, along with providing tools for everyday use like calculators and calendars, even allowing us access the internet where ever we go.

My cell phone is everything to me, whenever I'm hanging out with my friends I can always keep in touch with my dad and keeping track of time, but my teacher took my phone up for using the calculator on my phone, even though I was allowed to use a calculator for my work, why should students get penalized for that?

As glad as I am for the cell phone policy being changed I have to speak for my fellow students, both ideas are terrible.

Everyone will be happy to have their phones out during lunch break but problems still stand, we will take advantage of this opportunity and still use our phones even when we're not supposed to, it happens all the time, and not allowing phones at all? That's asking for kids to use phones in the first place!

Phones are such a gigantic part of our lives that we can't live without them, my idea is that phones should be allowed at school but they shouldn't be taken away, we should be able to use phones other than for the soul purpose of calling and being a distraction. Getting notes from friends, accessing the internet for information, and using the tools for help, something can be worked out but phones should be a part of our school lives as well.
