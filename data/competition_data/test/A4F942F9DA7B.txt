The face on mars was not created by aliens. A huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of a eyes, nose, and mouth. When NASA took a photograph ten times sharper than the one Vikings took it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Some people were not satisfied. Some believe that the photo was not taken correcly because the face of Mars is locted 41 degrese north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. This time of year is cloudy on the red planet. The skeptics believe that the alien markings were covered up by haze. But why would the Alien markings be coverd up by haze and not the face.

So The mission controllers prepared to look again. They took a better picture and made the picture three times bigger. On the day they retook the photo it was a clear day and if there was an object on the ground you would be able to identify that object. The face on Mars is proven to be a natural landform.
