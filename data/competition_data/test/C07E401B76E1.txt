Limiting car usages is a way to help people and the environment all around us. limiting car usage can have lots of effects,there are advantages and disadvantages of limiting car usage. disadvantages of limiting car usage would be to release greenhouse gases in the air and contaminating the surface,and people breathing the muggy air, or smog. advantages for limiting car usage is when someone wants to go somewhere on time and they have thie own viechile and they can control the car to where they want to go.

Communities are trying to find way not to have gases in the air and to reduce the uses of modern transportation. people try not to use cars alot and instead they do other things to get to places like taking a bus, bicycling,running,skating and things like that. using those resources will decrease gases in the environment and people can relax and breathe in fresh air instead of gases. gases are toxic to natural influences and can damage them.

Disadvantages of limiting car usage is to release lots of gases and smog,therefore makeing the environmets a hazardous place to be in. people can get sick from inhaling the smoke or they could die if they breathe in too much. thats why people should try not too use transportations any day to make the environmets a healthy and clean place for poeple to live in and to enjoy.

Advantages of limiting car usage would be to use cars or other transportation because someone might want to go somewhere and its a long distance,people could drive to  thier destination,and on time if they have somewhere to be like a buisness or a meeting the person needs to attend. If they took the bus the trip might last longer if the person is in a rush to get somewhere. Thats for long distace,for short dstances, people could take the bus to go somewhere close by or walk to the place. you could get somewhere faster if you walk and there is traffic,you would be stuck for a while if you were driving,only in heavily dense populated area would that most likely to happen,it would release lots of smog to the environment when lots of cars are in one place.

In places in the world lots of people are contributing to not using transportation to get to places but instead they are using non-gas usable transportations  like bikes and skates to get to place to place. people also walk, it is a good exercize for people to do and it is a healthy influence. other people might see someone do it and they might want to do it as well. the best thing to do to save the environmet from hazard gases is to use gas transportations less and use physical transportation,like walking it would be better to do than to realease fumes in the air people breathe and hurt their body. So if someone wanted to go to the store and its close by, instead of taking a transportation walking would be healthier and more benificial for the environment and people around you.
