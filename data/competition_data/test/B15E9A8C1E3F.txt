Dear principle

I think it is better for students to not bring there phones to school because they will concentrate more on there phones instead of there school work. The first reason why i think it is better for students to keep there phones home is because they can concentrate better on there school work. if they have there phones with them, they are text during there classes and then they are going to fail. Not only text during class but they also could be talking on the phone during school. Another reason why i think students should keep there phones home is because they can concentrate better. students can finish there work on time and they can have a better education for there future. Also, i think that during free time students should be finishing there missing work or homework so that they don't forget and get a grade for there work. Also some students don't keep there phones off during there classes. they could be texting people or even go to the restroom to talk or even text somebody on there phone. That's why i think it is better for students to keep there phones at home. Many students do not do there work because they concentrate mostly on there phones. but not all students obey there teachers either. some students get in trouble for texting during there classes and then they serve the consequences. that is why i think it is better for you to not allow phones during free time or at all during school. thank you for reading my letter. i hope you can understand why i think it is better to keep phones off during school.

Sincerely,
