PHONES AND DRIVING

In this world in which we live in, cell phones are a growing market as well as cars. The fact that we depend on cell phones throught the course of our day for numerous reasons.

Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving because its easier to operate a phone in your hand than a cell phone that is not in your hand. Emergencies can occur while driving and you need to report the emergerncy while driving. Cell phones does not cause as big of a distracHon that other things that is done while driving.

A lot of people are in an uproar about driving and using a cell phone and someHmes it is overrated. Trying to operate a cell phone with one hand while maintaining driving has no danger to it. A phone that is mounted on the holder that begins to ring is harder to operate answering, dialing and switching calls.

Most Hmes the mounHng is not secure or has defected parts which can cause more of an issue than having it to your ear. Most people have older cars and cannot a? ord to upgrade and dont have the speaker opHon, which usually allows everyone surrounding your car to know you business.

I cannot say it enough, emergencies happen in a ?ash. Driving and you see a accident that needs emergency aLenHon you need to be able to use the cell phone to call it in. Things happen so quickly now and it could be your phone call that saves their life. Also if a person is lost and no gps signal but calls can be made a person should be able to dial someone by hand and get direcHons out of harms way. Emergency is a big deal in cell phone usage.

Cell phones do not cause as much as a distracHon than people make out to be. As a driver a person should always be aware of the road and be able to mulH-task when using a cell phone. Most Hmes its other things besides a cell phone that cause a distracHon but blames the cell phone as a scapegoat. There could be test on the driver liscence test that we should take to see if were able to drive and talk on the phone instead of just banning it.

Talking on a cell phone and driving a car may be a distracHon for some but not all. It should be our call on if we are focused enough to drive while talking. Although some people are said to have had bad behavior while talking and driving some are very responsible. TexHng and driving is di? erent from talking and driving and that should be the boundary. Each person should be accountable for their acHons just as speeding.
