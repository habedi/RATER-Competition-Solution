Although it may seem that there is a "face" on Mars, there isn't. There have been conspiracy theories that the "face" on Mars is part of the remains of an alien, but that is not true. There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.

After studying the "face" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the "face" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the "face". There are many other theories of what the for may be.

I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the "alien head" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the "face" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the "face" was real, but can you always trust magazines. Magazines will lie sometimes so that they get a story that people will want to read. You can't really determine that the "face" is actually a face.

In conclusion, the "face" is not a face. Although it may have seemed like a face to a lot of people, it wasn't. Later on this will be a time to laugh at because some people actually thought that the rock formation was a face.
