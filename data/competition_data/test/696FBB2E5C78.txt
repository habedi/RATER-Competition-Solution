You may think that the landform that resembles a human face is proof that there is alien life on Mars, but it actually does not prove anything. There are many reasons that the mesa could be there, and alien life is the least likely. Mesas are common around the area that the face was found, and recent pictures have proved that it is just a landform. Even taking the picture on a cloudless, sunny day proved nothing. It is simply a landform, and nothing more.

You might argue that it is unlikely that the landform is a mesa because it isn't natural, or that it looks unnatural. While it does look unnatrual, they are actually very common around the area that the face was found. Saying that it can't be a mesa because mesas aren't common simply isn't true. Cydonia has many mesas, the face included. There are plenty of mountains on Earth, and we all know that those aren't man-made. No one talks about one certain mountain that is man-made, while the rest aren't. Why should Mars be any different? They are all natural landforms, there isn't one that's just man made.

You may also argue that the first picture was taken on a day that was cloudy, or that the picture was unclear. You would be correct, which is why NASA went back eighteen years later and took the photo again on a cloudless, clear and sunny day. The picture was taken in summer, which is generally pretty cloudless in Mars. There was practically nothing that might obstruct the view of the "face", and what did we find? Nothing. We found a landform, just like we had found eighteen years earlier. There was nothing to obstruct the view. That means that when we did look and find nothing, that there was nothing there.

You still might not be convinced. You might say that we simply weren't close enough to find any strange alien markings, or that camera's quality wasn't good enough to see any of the strange alien markings, but that would also be correct. We took a picture of the mysterious "face" three times. Once in 1976, once in 1998, and finaly in 2001. Each time the picture was taken, the camera's quality was better. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters in the 1976 photo. With the image being that detailed, we would have been able to spot things as small as shacks next to the mysterious "face". We didn't, however. We found nothing except for the landmark, which proves that it is nothing more than an unusual landmark.

In conclusion, there is countless proof that the "face" on Mars is nothing more than an unusal mesa. Mesas are common in Cydonia, which is where the landmark was spotted. We have taken three photos, the quality better with each, and each time nothing other than the landmark was spotted. We even went back to take the photo on a cloudless, clear and sunny day with our best camera yet, and we still found nothing. That is all the proof that I need, and it's all the proof you need. There is nothing on Mars other than an unusual landmark, that happens to look like a face.
