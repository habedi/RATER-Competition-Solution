In today's modern world, new inventions are shaping our daily lifestyle. Cellphones took over meeting personally, calculators took over long divison, and cars took over walking from point A to point B. No one really thought how dependant our world would be on this new-age technologies. Our ancestors certainly didn't have the latest smartphone or a brand new Mercedes in their driveway. So what made our generation so materialistic? The necessity of a brand new car, (or any car for that matter) is slowly diminishing, and more people are getting back to using other forms of transportation. The limiting use of cars is super beneficial to the environment, your family's budget, and can bring better social opportunities.

The use of cars has both positive and negative effects. Car usage has a massive impact on the environment, not just in your community, but worldwide. As we all know, global warming is an international phenomenon that is nipping at our toes. It is (mostly) caused by pollution and the dissolvement of the ozone layer, which protects our atmosphere. Gas emissions from tailpipes cause a great amount of greenhouse gases to disperse. In Europe, "cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions" (Elizabeth Rosenthal: Source 1). In the United States, the grenhouse gas emissions are 50% caused by passenger cars (Rosenthal; Source 1). That means everytime you get into your car for a "cruise", you are harming our environment. Trapped car emmisions combine with the warm weather layers in the air to form smog, which is greatly affecting the French capital, and Beijing (source 2: Duffer). To help prevent these emissions from getting worse, or causing greater harm to our environment, some cities have started a "car-free zone", in which no one is allowed to own cars or use them and even park them in their driveway! (source 1: Rosenthal). By creating or participating in a limiting use of cars you can help preserve our beloved Mother Earth.

Every 16-year old dreams of waking up to their brand-new car waiting for them in the driveway. But demographic studies recently show that "there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-39 year olds getting licenses." (source 4: Rosenthal). This decrease is proof that less and less people are interested in owning cars, and even worse, driving them. This doesn't seem like a bad idea, due to the fact that the limited use of cars can save you and your family a great deal of money. New cars are approximately ranging from $25,000 to $50,000, with a monthly payment of about $350. A gallon of gas usually lasts about a week and a half and costs an average of $40 to fill up. In a month, a typical family spends approximately $400 a month solely on car expenses. By choosing to involove yourself in "smart planning", which is the seperation of suburban life from auto use (Source 1: Rosenthal) or by using other means of transportation like public buses, trains, bikes, and the sharing of taxis, your household can save a good amount of money.

In modern families, not only has the over-use of technology/social media taken over the traditional family interaction, but also the over-use of cars. In most households, where the teenager has a vehicle, he/she mobilizes themselves away and out with friends. Everyone ends up in different parts of the town, the mall, a restaurant, or at home. If the use of cars is limited, either in a town like Vauban (Germany), where no one uses cars, or in a city like Bogota (Colombia), where families use multiple seat bicycles to visit parks and spend time together (source 3:Selsky), your family can make up for lost time and completely forget about going off on their own. Not only will the days without cars benefit your family but also your social life! A date to bike-tour the city at night is much more enticing and luring then a plain date to the movies. If you need a car, for any reason, whether it be work, or vacation, rental car services are a much better and cheaper option then using your own car.

The innovative programs like "Smart Planning", discussed in

"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"

, and the "Day without cars" celebrated in many Colombian cities like Bogota and Cali, discussed in Andrew Selsky's

"Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota"

can provide a interactive and enjoyable lifestyle without the hassle and stress of cars. Not only will your family's social life benefit but also your household's economy! The limiting use of cars can help you or anyone save money without paying those hefty monthly bills, as implied in Source 4:

"The End of Car Culture"

. Last but certainly not least, by reducing your car dependancy, you can help protect the environment by stopping the greenhouse gas emissions from your vehicle, as explained in Source 2:

"Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"

. Overall, the limited use of cars is beneficial in numerous ways, and hopefully will be exercised much more.
