Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that the students should have a choice on whether they want to do community work or not. I think this because many students have sport and other things to do. The things they do might be more important or even better then doing community work. Some of This things might include sports, homework, or may be they have a job at a store or at home.

Students should have a voice in what they do. I don't think that they should be forced to do community work because they have other things to do such as sports. Many people sports after school and they love them. If they do community service they wont be able to do those sports because of the time that they've used. Some students only do sports in school time because other sports outside of school are expensive, and school sports are much cheaper. If they take that time after school they will never be able to participate in any kind of sport. they will also become over weight.

Students sometimes do just sit around the house doing nothing sometimes, but for the most part there is homework to be done. Sometimes homework can take hours because you just cant think of anything to write down on that research paper. Or can't even find the information on the internet.

I'm 14 and i know friends of my age that have jobs already. if we have to do community work we wont be able to go to our jobs and work. The' re bosses will fire them and they wont have jobs anymore. It's important to have jobs because it gives a sense of responsibility. If we get community service it would feel more like a punishment of some kind because we wont get pay, and we like getting and earning our own money.

If people have extra time and want to help out the community it's perfectly fine., but we shouldn't be forced to do so. I think that Community service should be done by inmates that are in prison so they can maybe get early release, and not just sit in a cell. We shouldn't because people have other things that they want to do, have to do, and love to do. Like sports, homework, and even jobs.
