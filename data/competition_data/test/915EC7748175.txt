I belive that the FACS technology would be valuable. I think that it would be valuable because it can probably tell if a student is cheating or if the student is tired.

The Facial Action Coding System would allow the computer to track the users face. It would allow the computer to know if the student is cheating seeing if the user is smiling a little. It would alse be able to see it the user is tired or bored. If the user (or student) was tired or bored could tell the computer to switch it up a little bit and try to make whatever they are doing a little bit funner.

The text states that if you see an ad on your screen and you smile it will show you a ad just like that one. If you frown when you see that ad it will show you a conpletely differnet one.

That is just a couple of thing the FACS can do. So that is why I belive that it would be valuable.
