This article talks about when and how going to venus and exploring it will happen, it might be these days or way into the future.

The author talks about how going to Venus will be very hard but not impossible, and that maybe a long time ago Venus could've been a place to live in because it has almost the same size, density, and distance to the Sun as Earth.

NASA has even had missions to go to Venus, but the author says because of it's thick cloud of carbon dioxide (97 percent) spacecrafts are not able to make an apropriate landing on Venus, that is also a reason why humans have not been sent to Venus for it's dangerous high pressure and sulfuric acid clouds. The article also states that like Earth, Venus also causes many natural disasters and weather storms like "eruptung volcanoes, powerful earthhquakes, and frequent lightning strikes."

Scientist are still trying to find ways to go to Venus but not into Venus because it is very hard and dangerous. NASA can make ships capable of hovering over Venus so they can take pictures of Venus inside it's atmosphere, but also because of the thick cloud no light is strong enough to go through the clouds and to do this spacecrafts need to be able to resist the outside atmosphere temperatures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

In conclusion, traveling to Venus and studying it is a difficult mission but not impossible, the author says that "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents." The author fully supports his idea by what the article talks about and the dangers humans will confront.
