The author was talking about all off the crazy thing that venus has in common with planet earth, but it would be highly dangerous to go. When the author talks about all of the bad conditions that venus has its makes you really think how hard it would be to get to the hot lava planet. What the author is trying to get you to see is that venus has a lot of dangerous conditions, but that the scientists know how hard that would be.

The author starts off with putting details of venus in our head by saying things like, "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus" and "On the planetÂ’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit". By this the author is trying to tell you how hard it would be for man-kind to be in physical contact with venus. The author is putting physical details in our head about this planet.

After the author starts talking about that he states the question "why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface"? The author ask this to us thinking about whats the point if there is nothing speaical its just a hot rock. Wrong, the author states how venus was just like earth it had it valleys it had its water it had everything earth has. It would be very good to know that if anything happen to earth we always have a back up planet to go to.

The last thing that the author was trying to do was talk about how The National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. When I read that it kinda got me excitied i was thinking we might get to see mars wow thats cool. The author states that "imagines a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian landscape".

In conclusion what the author is trying to get the reader to do would be make all of the reader think about how cool it would be to be able to go to a "earth like planet". How he uses the details and the things they learned from NASA kinda gets you exicited about what will come in the future. So the author was giving us all of these reasoning about how dangerous it would be but it woukd be very good to know.
