Have you ever gotten a long project to do over the summer? Was it your freedom to make it or did the teacher give you steps to do it? This is one issue with schools around the world, wondering if they should make summer projects teacher or student oriented. Projects over the summer should be conducted by students because, you get a sense of freedom while making it, organize it the way you like, and get to represent what you can do.

However, some people may not agree with this position. Some people may argue that teacher-designed projects may have more exact and clearer steps. Teacher-directed projects also might have better organization compared to student-directed projects. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, projects over the summer should be conducted by students because, you get a sense of freedom. Based on national studies, Students are more likely to have a heavy state of mind when doing these long projects. When students make their own projects, they get to do whatever they want, when they want and show off their freedom to make their own project how they would like. Another study based off CNN showed that students who got to make their own projects had higher scores and more passing grades than if the teacher made the project. Having freedom on a project shows higher scores and more successful students.

In addition, projects over the summer should be conducted by students because, it lets them organize the project the way they like. Based off personal experience, I far better liked the idea of organizing projects the way I like. It helped me really take in more information and see it in a way which helps me out. Other students could say the same and agree with my point of view. Letting students organize their project will help them out and make it easier on them.

Finally, projects over the summer should be conducted by students because, It lets them represent what they can do. Students usually, when given a freedom of some sort, really can show off what they can do. For example, art. Art is a way of freedom in drawing and artist's creations are always beautiful and great. The same concept can be applied to student projects. If a student were to do a project alone they could show off what they could really do and impress a lot of people including the teacher.

In conclusion, projects should be student conducted because, they get a sense of freedom, organize the way they like, and lets them show what they can do. So next time you're assigned a project over the summer, Think about changing it to a self-directed project instead of a teacher-directed so you can receive these benefits.
