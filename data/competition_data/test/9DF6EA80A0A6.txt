Transportation is a must in today's society, and car usage plays a big role in the subject. Limiting car usage has many advantages. Reduced usage of cars can help the enviroment in various ways. Less car usage can help citizens be less dependent on cars, and can be a great stress reliever for others.

The enviroment is a big part of the lives of people and needs to be taken care of. Cars are known for polluting the air and damaging the enviroment. One of the problems about the air pollution involves greenhouse gas emissions. In the article ("In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal), Paragraph 5 states "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States". Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Smog is another issue due to car usage. Paris is a known city for smog. In the article ("Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer), it says "Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.", meaning that smog is a big problem in the enviroment. Air pollution can be reduced with limited car usage and can help the enviroment in which we live in. Being independent can be one of the many benefits of limited car usage.

Relying on car usage can put people at a disadvantage. Limiting car usage can help citizens become less reliant on automobiles. Paragraph 20 states "BOGOTA,Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." (Source 3, Andrew Selsky). There are many differents ways of using transportation without having to rely on car usage. Jobs and businesses can be accessible through many alternative choices of transportation. Source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states "He and I have similar obsercations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk of take public transportation or car-pool with friends." (paragraph 39). Different Transportaion routes, or options, gives a wider variety of getting somewhere. Limited car usage can help citizens be more independent with transportation. Limited Car usage can be a way of relieving stress.

Citizens believe that limited car usage gives them the advantage of relieving stress. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," (Source 1, Paragraph 3). Reduced car usage can cause a fellow citizen to feel happier. Paragraph 35 of Source 4 says "The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends." Citizens feel more connected with friends without the neccessity of car usage. Less Driving impacts the lives of citizens in a postive way.

Limited car usage can only be seen as an advantage, it brings out many positive things. Reduced Car usage is Enviroment friendly and reduces air pollution. Less driving is a better way of being independent and stress-free. The world can be a better place with limited use of automobiles.
