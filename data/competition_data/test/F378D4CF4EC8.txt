Distance learning can provide many benefits to students and teachers. I feel, students should have the choice of deciding if distance learning or traditional learning is the right fit for them. Almost, every student will be eager to take their classes online. Not everyone will agree with my opinion, but here is why I strongly believe students should follow through with distance learning. By taking classes online, students will benefit by being given the choice to waking up when they desire. It will teach students better time management skills. As well as, being able to take their time on learning a new unit without feeling rushed. I think students will excel and benefit from attend school online rather than physically attending school

To begin, a benefit from attending class from home is, waking up whenever you desire. Students should have the choice to get out of bed when their body is well rested enough to start the day. For example, some schools start at 7:15 a. m. meaning, in order to have a well breakfast, time to get ready, and arrive at school on time, will expect the student to wake up even earlier to have time to complete their morning checklist. Once they arrive to school, they will not be physically and mentally prepared to fully function once the school day has started from the lack of energy they have. If students had the to choice to wake up when they are ready to wake up, they will have more energy to complete their assignments and get their work done. Some may say, if you allow the student to wake up whenever they desire, they will not complete their work and will put it off until they are behind in their academics. This is where time management comes in play.

Some believe, by allowing the student to decide how they want to manage their day will result in major issues in failing to complete their academic work. But on the contrary, by giving students the responsibility to complete their online assignments on time and by managing their own personal life, will give them the advantage to create a schedule that fits them the best. Not every student is the same. Every student carries busy and different lives, some include: sports, work, training and other extracurricular activities. It will teach students problem solving skills in determining how they should manage their own time. Once being able to balance out their schedule, students can not only use this skill for the present but for future purposes as well.

Lastly, distance learning will allow the student to move at their own paste. It will provide the student the ability to take their time on a certain subject that requires more time an attention for them to fully grasp the information they need to know. A personal example, I struggle in math class. As a class, we learn something new each class and from that, we build on from the prior class. If I didn't understand the material taught to us from the prior class, it will be hard to grasp the new material from the next class. Because of this, I struggle to comprehend the unit while also, being ready on time to take the exam with the rest of the class; even if I end up understanding the unit, I now fall behind on my other class work that needs to be done as well. It not only interferes with my set schedule but also my own extracurricular activities as well.

I believe, students will benefit from attending school online to provided for a well rested mind, improvement in time management skills, and also being able to understand the material at their own paste. Many students will excel and enjoy their high school experience with having the opportunity to take take their classes online. It will beyond beneficial to those students who carryout very busy lives and to those who rather just prefer to take their classes online. If all schools offered distance learning as an option for students to attend their classes online or video conferencing, I believe many students will excel in not only their academics but in their future life as well.
