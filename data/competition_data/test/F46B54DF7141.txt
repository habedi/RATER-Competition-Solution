Do you think it is fair for your schools principle to make you have to join an extracurricular activity without you wanting to join one? I think it is unfair for the students who might not want to join any activity they might not like. Most students want to come to school to learn and not join an activity because their principle makes them because they want to get a higher education and get into a good college to get into a better job. If people do want to join an activity of their choice it can be playing in a sport, work on a yearbook, or serve on the student council.

I disagree with the idea of joining one of the activities because if your principle makes you join one than you might join something you might not like doing. It will also be upsetting for the students because they will have to take time of of what they might be doing after school to stay after, if it is an after school activity, to stay after and work on what they have joined. The students will also hate it because they will have to stay back almost every day just to do their activity.

If the principle makes everyone join an activity for school than there might not be enough room for everyone to join their favorite activity they like the most. If there is not enough room in one activity for many people, than they will have to join a different activity. If there is not enough room in any other activity for them to join than there is no possible way for a person to join any activity. Then the school will have to just have you not join an activity or make some more activities for them to join.

If a person really likes joining school activities then this is their go time. Most people like joining school activities because it helps them in certain ways they might have issues in. The issues can help them relax those issues for if they occur at home or even at school, they will join because it will help them a lot. People will also join because the activities they do in school might help them with their job in the future if their job will be joining a football team for the NFL, or joining the NBA, the activities you do in school will help you for the future.

People might not joining activities in school but in some good ways it can help you a lotÂ with the future. I still think that it is unfair for some students because they might not like any of the activities. So i think it is unfair and not a good idea because of all of the students that might want to just join one activity is going to be unfair for all of the other activities that might have no one in the class.
