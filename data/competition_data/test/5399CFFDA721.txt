The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program that sends diffrent cowboys overseas to help out many countries that are trying to recover from war or just do not have the essientials they need.

According to the story in paragraph 2 some cowboys were sent in 1945,after World War ll to Europe to help these countries recover their food supplies,animals,and many other things.44 nations jonied together to form UNRRA and hired in "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. The passage also states in paragragh 5 that besides helping people,you get the side benefit of sight seeing. For example Luke was able to explore Europe and China,Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. In paragraph 7 Luke had an accident. During the accident Luke cracked his ribs,he could not work for a couple of days. In paragragh 8 Luke found ways to pass time while his ribs were still injured.

Luke says in paragragh 9 that he was so grateful for the oppurtunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy. He says it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. If you decide to to join the Seagoing Cowboys program it will sure be a great expirence for you.
