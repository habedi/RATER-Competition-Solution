Dear Principle,

I hear you are considering not letting students participate in school sports or activities unless they have a grade B average. I personally do not agree with that decision. Over half the kids in this school have a C average and most of the players on any teams have a C average. Even some of the best.

The kids we have playing for are athletics teams and also other kids participating in other activities, are good at what they do. Remember we go to competitions and games and if we have all the good players kicked off the team just because their grades, then we'll have a bad team. We might not even be able to make it to regions on some of the sports we do! What will people think of SCHOOL_NAME athletic department then?

Kids need to get out and enjoy playing sports; it actually helps them do better in school with an exercised mind. Sure, some people say it's to much work trying to keep up with grades and a sport or activity but it's not. If adults can go and do a job, come home, cook dinner, and worry about kids and babies running around, then i think kid's can handle a sport and grades.

I can understand not letting kids participate in activities if there failing a class but just making a C average i don't understand that. Some kids might grow up to be famous athletes and might not need knowledge. Yes, they still need to try their best but some peoples best isn't enough to make an A or even a B. So i think we should still let those making C averages play and participate in sports and other activities, as long as their not failing any other classes. SO please think about reconsidering your decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
