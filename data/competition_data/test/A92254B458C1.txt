"

your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree or disagree with this decision ." I agree with this decision in the following areas of extra size, helping the school or teachers, and getting extra help. However, their in these activities so students can learn and have fun.

The first reason why all the students should participate in school activities is extra size from playing sports. However, when students play sports their running, throwing, hitting, and kicking. For example, playing baseball, football, soccer, these are ways of getting extra size,it is good for you. Therefore, its not only about extra size its about having fun and hanging with friends during the activities. Sport games get intense when playing with friends, students and others go hard core.

Another reason why students should participate in the activities is so they can Help the school or teachers means grade papers, plant flowers, help janitors, tutor others, and work on year book. Those are things that are helpful, The principal would love for the students to participate in a helping activity so all the staff or teachers don't have to do it by them self the students can help. Therefore, students should join helping activities so their grades can get in on time because their helping teachers grade papers and also the students would have a clean school.

The third and final, students should participate in after school extracurricular activities because they can get extra help on class work that the students struggle with. However, say a student doses not get whats going on in a class they can ask a teacher for after school pass and stay after. Therefore, this is a very helpful way to help students with their classes or assignments. For example, when i need help i ask the teacher for a lunch pass or after school pass and then she has more time to explain vs in a regular time period class she has to help others too with their work.

To come to the conclusion the principal has made the right choice to make all students come to different types of activities,sport activities, helping staff or teachers, extra help, there in these activities so students can learn and have fun. I agree with this decision in the following areas of extra size, helping the school or teachers, and getting extra help.
