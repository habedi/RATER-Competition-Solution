There are many reasons why at home classes can benefit students. Things like getting sick and mental illness can really make it hard for students to get to school. These things could benefit a lot from the option of taking classes at home via online sources along with making the process of school being a little easier on students. Giving an option like this to students would be a great improvement.

It is very common for students to get sick and not be able to attend school due to their illness. When this happens, students can fall very behind in their school work causing them to fail. If students can access their classes from home, it can help solve this problem. Instead of the stress that comes with falling behind, they can keep up with all of their work wherever they may be and whatever condition they may be in.

Many students have mental illnesses that may affect how they work in school. Things like anxiety, depression, OCD, and even bipolar disorders can make school very hard for some people. If there was an option to attend classes at home, these people would barely hesitate to take this opportunity. It may be hard for other people to realize how much these students actually struggle with going to school.

At home classes could really improve the performance of these students with their school work.

Students can have a much easier time going through class at home for many reasons. They will be able to take things at their own pace and without so much pressure on them. When at school, teachers have so much to go through and end up going very fast not giving students a chance to keep up with them. This wouldn't be a problem with online classes since students are able to take the time they need. Also students will be way better in their work while being in the comfort of their own homes.

At home classes are very beneficial for many reasons, from helping when students get sick or for the students who have mental illnesses and also by just making things a bit easier for students. There will definitely be more good than bad from offering the option to attend classes at home for students.Â
