There are planets that we all are curious about, but with curiousity comes danger. Challenging ourselves with exploring with Venus is a risk but it's a risk that we might take. Astronomers are intreged that Venus once have been a Earth-like place before and includes familiar features like earth. Also Exploring Venus may be exciting but also dangerous because of it thick atmosphere of 97% of carbon dioxide and it temperture average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. With that being said, it's worthy of studying despite the dangers it presents.

Astronomers are intreged that Venus once have been a Earth-like place before.

Years ago, "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." As it sates in Paragrapgh 4,sentence 3. Venus might be like mars because Venus might be worthy of living but we won't know for sure if scienists don't study the planet.

Another reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it persents because it includes familiar feature like earth. If Venus once had familiar features,then it was probably suitable for forms of life. In the article, paragragh 4,sentence 4 states "Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Eath" Also in paragapgh 4 sentence 5 states "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and included familiar feaatures such as valleys, mountains and craters."

It may be worth studying but it comes with dangers such as Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% of carbon dioxide. A human being could handle so little of carbon dioxide because its toxic to bodies. Also,it's clouds has sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. In the article, in paragrapgh 3 sentence 1 states "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide." Also in paragraph 3,sentence 2 sates "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid Venus's atmosphere."

Another reason why it be might be dangerous, if the scientists decide to study the planet is because of the temperture of being 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Even though if a human being can't step a foot on Venus, it can send a special meachine that can withstand that temperture. In the article it states in paragraph 3, setence 3 "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800
