Dear Principal,

Cell phone are a distraction to all of us students. It is another way to gossip, spread rumors, and talk bad about people. It is mindless when people text. They use it as a weapon to emotionally hurt people. I see when middle school students text, they have nothing much to say.

Cell phones was a great invention, now has become more then just talk. It is a device that can ruin someone. When I look at my sister's text, all they say is "Tehe", "What's up?", "lol", and a lot more conversations that do not need to be said. It annoys me when people text friends in there school, they don't even have anything to say! I am now going to have to go with Policy 2.

Banning cell phones would make people want to bring them even more. The students will bring them because they think they are going to be cool for breaking the rules. I understand that bringing the cell phone will help you contact your parents after school, however there are tons of phones around the school that can be used to call your parents. All I ask is to ban cell phone to prevent less fights, rumors, emotionally hurt people, etc...

Yours Truly,
