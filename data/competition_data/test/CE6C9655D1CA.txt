Hi i'm luke,i'm here to conveince you guys to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It was so much fun for me. We got to go to so many places. One of the places was China. It takes kinda long to get to those places but, hey at least it's fun.

For the Seagoing Cowboys you just don't travel you also have to do stuff. One of the things are taking care of the animals on the boat thatare traveling places. That's why were called the seagoing cowboys. All because we take care of animals on a boat while the boat is moving.

If you do join the Seagoing Cowboys you have to be carful becuase sometimes you might fall and get hurt. I had my ribs cracked one time because I slipt and fell. It hurt but I still had to do what I had to do for the animals. I got a little time off but, not a lot.

The Seagoing Cowboys are fun. So, if you ever do think about doing it JOIN! I joined and when I turned eighteen. I didn't have to join the army all because I was doing the Seagoing Cowboys. If your a boy and dont want to do your army service do the Seagoing Cowboys.
