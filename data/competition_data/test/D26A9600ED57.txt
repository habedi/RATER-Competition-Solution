I think Luke experiened wonderful and amazing things he also may have seen disturbing things like seeing the Acropolis in Greece that was probably amazing but seeing war results was probably very disturbing. I also think traveling months at a time would make me really anxious and board untill the games came in then that would have made a little less boaring but I still would have been a little anxious to get to where I needed to go. And I couldn't imagine going across the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice that is just absulutaly crazy I really don't know how he Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist. I did not know who these men were or what this story was about but after I read this story I now highly respect Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist for what they did and how many times they risked their lifes to save other people that were in trouble.
