Venus; the second planet in our solar system, Earth's twin, and neighbors next to Earth and Mars. Venus and Mars are the closest planets to Earth, but when moving around the sun, sometimes mars is closer to earth than venus and vice versa. Another thing about Venus is that its kind of Earth's twin. Venus is closest to Earth's size and density than all the other planets. But one thing about mars is, its virtually unexplorable. Despite the dangers on this planet, the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" wants scientists to go foward into exploring Venus. Here is his evidence in his article that supports him.

Scientists have tried to explor Venus, and have spent millions of dollars on space craft to try to land on it. Those missions had to be unmanned, why though? None of the spacecrafts that went to Venus survived for lots of reasons. Venus's atmosphere is thick and is 97 percent carbon dioxide and is full of clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, also the temperature averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we feel here on earth. Venus could crush anything and liquefy our metals as well with the hottest surface temperatures in our solar system. Along with all of those factors of stopping the exploration of Venus, there are also earthquakes, erupting volcanos, and lightning strikes. Even after listing all those facts, the author still wants to study Venus.

Scientists are able to study some of Venus while being a safe distence from the planet, but they wont be able to get any fragments of the ground or any samples of the planet. Also, with the dense clouds in Venus's atmosphere, they wouldn't be able to see much of the ground. But, the author thinks they have found a way. Scientists at NASA have been testing out a some new eletronics and puttuing them to the test with similar Venus dangers, and so far they have passed. The scientists are making new technologies stronger to be able to withstand Venus, at least long enough to get what they need to be able to study venus further. I bet the author is happy about that.

This author of this article did not give up on his idea of studing Venus. No matter how many dangerous and deadly things they threw at him, and even the scientists. They never gave up hope of someday exploring venus, and now hopefully hear soon they can give the new information they have gathered from venus to the author.
