I think the seagoing cowboys program is very helpful and an exciting thing to do for a career. It is an oppertunity of a lifetime.

The seagoing cowboys program will allow you to experience adventures and visit many unique places. in the text it states "it took 2 weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states to get to china".

If you like to have fun while helping people in need then this a great program for you. In the text it also states "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed .table tennis tournaments ,reading, whittling, fencing ,boxing ,and games also helped pass the time.

Some people may think that this would not be fun for them and that you might miss your family while you gone, but there is a solution for that. You could bring your family with you and bring things with you to help pass the time.

In conclusion i think that the seagoing cowboys program is very successful helpful and exciting program would love to have more people to help people effected by world war II.
