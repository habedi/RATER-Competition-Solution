Dear principal, i think we should keep the policy. That students should have a B average in order to participate in any school sports or activity. First because, they should prove they are able to keep their grades up. Second because, you shouldn't treat them in doing any activity they enjoy when their grades are bad. And third because, they shouldn't get what they want. It's not the teacher fault when they show poor effort.

First, because they should prove they are able to keep their grades up. By doing that they would be able to enjoy the activity's and stuff. Instead of failing and can't do sports with your friends. Proving that they are ready. If not they will be the only student failing and can't attend any sport just because of a simple grade.

Second, because you shouldn't treat them in any activity they enjoy when their grades are bad. For instead, they would think its cool for having horrible grades. And wouldn't do anything to save themselves for passing to the next level. And what will they do when others are laughing at them. they should prove themselves that they are learning in order to join others in activity's and sports.

Third, they shouldn't get what they want. Meaning they know they can do the activity's when their grades suck. NOT going to happening. Teachers are working hard just so they can be something in life. so they should show effort. And by them doing all of this they could join in the sports and activity's they want to do. Proving themselves that's they want to do the activity's and sports.

These are my reason's why we should keep they policy. And if we do, we would see many changes in the students. Then everyone will be happy. So i say keeping the policy is the best choice. So failing wouldn't be a choice. And sports and activity would be enjoyed by many smart student.
