lmithing car usage is a bad thing or a good thing ? here are some of the reson why i think that limithing car uasge is a good thing to do .

reason one why i think limithing car uasge is that we wont have to pay for gas alot more then we have to casue we wont be usage are cars . some cars got good gas milege but some cars dont have that and we cant forget are diesel trucks owners they dont have good milege and diesel is expensive to its like $100 or more dollars to fill up you diesal truck.

second reson why i think we should limit car uasge is so we wont be lazy go out and go for a walk with your family or a bike ride , hicking also skate something just to enjoy the day and the nice weather . do what BOGOTA, colombia they had a car free day that only buses and taxi where on the road . so they can take the buses or taxi to work or where ever they wanted to go and if you where driving on the street with your car you would be fined $25 . its also good why to take stress away you wont have to worry about being late or being stuck in traffic or you car wont start .

last reson why i think we should limit car usage is that we can lower the air pollution like beijing,china they are know as one of the most polluted cities in the world cause they have some many citizens living there so at least half or more have cars.

thats  why i think we should limit car usage cause we dont have to pay for gas and diesal also so we wont be lazy and get out of the house go out ride a bike, go walking ,skate something to just take away the stress of all the traffic and last be no least so we can lower the air pollition .
