To The Principle community service is great, and if I had to tell the principle whether we should do community service at school then I would agree. Now if I had to stay after school for it I would disagree. The reason I would disagree is because i have important stuff at home. For example: I have chores to do and when I'm done with that then comes the homework and after all that's done i like to watch television and play Xbox360.

We should all be required to do community service. It's good for nature and our health, we honestly don't want to be living in a trashed city or town. Throwing our trash on the ground is disrespectful and if there's a trash can right by you, you should consider throwing in the trash. If lazy ness controls you that bad that's just pathetic. Honestly no one wants to see trash on the ground and most importantly, watch you throw it on the ground.

You should have everyone do community service during before school and at lunch. Reassess isn't that important and we do need some planting. So if i were you I would consider the fact of making students to community service.
