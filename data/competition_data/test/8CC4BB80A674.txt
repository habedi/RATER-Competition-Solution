From reading the article "Driveless Cars Are Coming", I have figured out that driveless cars have been a long time coming. People have been thinking and working on them for years now. There are pros and cons to driveless cars. For the most part driveless cars would not be a bad idea to throw into the world. If driveless cars passed the laws, you would not have to do much work going places, with time the cars are going to get better and more high tech, and they seem to be safe.

Someone gets into their car and does not have to worry about touching the steering wheel, they just have to turn the car on. That is what it would be like if driveless cars come in the future. The family or a person can just sit in their car without paying attention to the road. On the other hand, a person does have to pay some attention to the cars actions because the car might need their help. For the most part, driveless cars would make life more easy-going. Some people dread having to drive long distances to get to the location they are going to but with driveless cars, it would be no trouble to hop in the car and sit in there while the car does it all for you.

The best part about technology is it is always improving. People are always discovering better ways to do things and improvements in how to do those things. With driveless cars, they can be doing many tests on them and trying out different ways til they get the driveless car reliable for people to trust. Everything improves over the years and driveless cars are one of them. In the future, people are going to find more advanced ways to put in the driveless car to make it a better, more trusting car.

Only a hand full of states are allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Most states have concerns but some states are willing to work with the manufactorers. If more states allow their state to test computer-driven cars, it would make it easier to find ways to improve on the car. Driveless cars are a big deal and they need to be the safest they can be for the roads they will be on. So far the driveless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves and it is only 2016. The future holds so much more.

Although there are many things that need to be worked on before they let driveless cars on the road, it is a good idea to keep improving the vehicles. If people keep working hard at it, no telling what the driveless car will be like over the years. It is important to make the best car possible. There is already so many great things going for the driveless car. If they keep testing the cars and finding ways to make it better, it will eventually make a very safe driveless car.
