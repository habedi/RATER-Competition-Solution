Ever thought of graduating and doing it say, the efficient way? I'm here to take a some of your time and explain to you that, learning from home isn't as helpful as learning in school. I say in my point of view learning from home like, video chatting or online class won't benefit as much because you could get distracted at home and won't get the work done. When being at school would benefit you much more.

Working from your home wouldn't benefit you as much. You could be on your couch trying to do the work and immediately get distracted, once you remember about your work it's to late to finish it. For example, what if the teacher assigned a quiz to the student at home? The student could easily cheat by being at home. When the time comes and theres a test, the student will fail because of the lack of cheating and will have no clue of what to do. Therefore it's better being at school so the teacher could supervise and the student.

If the teacher was to catch a student cheating, say on a quiz, it would benefit the student for learning their lesson. If the student is struggling and cheats, the best way the student can ask for help is by asking the teacher. An example is it's nice having your classmates around. Why you may say?

Some teachers do partner work and its nice working with your classmates. One could be better at one part and other isn't as much, their classmate could help them pull through. Also if you don't understand as much as what your classmate explains, that's why it's nice having the teacher around for help. If you take online class its tough. The teacher isn't physically their to point out the student mistake. On the other hand it's nice having the teacher around for motivation and the teacher would push you hard to do better physically, to do a better job in that class or classes.

For example, what if three of five students at their home don't have internet access and can't be able to do the online classes? Also the student's family come from poverty too, and can't afford it.

The teacher or the school for example is creating a bit stress for the family to pay for internet. When the student's family roughly make money to pay their rent bill, the food for the week. I bet if your a teacher and reading this, you wouldn't want your student worrying about economic issues. Another example I have is I have a friend, and she has economic issues, and its a bit of a hustle for family to gain a bit more money for the internet use at home. In fact, she didn't want to see her parents working to hard she got a job herself. No one wants to see a student fail there grade or fail the class because of the lack of economic issues. I bet you wanna see that student or students succeed. That's why I say doing online classes wouldn't benefit as much as to learning in school physically with your teacher around and your classmates.

In my conclusion doing online classes from home wouldn't benefit as much as to working in school physically. For example the only time were a student should be able to do online classes from home is when the student as has medical reason they can not show up to school. Also on the other hand too, if the student were to take online classes at their home is because, they talked to their consular about graduating early and want to advance that would be fine as long as they work hard and take advantage of that opportunity. Also one more life example is, some students may not like waking up early in the morning, but hey it benefits them by giving them a life experience on how waking up early to your job is important, just as waking up early to go to school.
