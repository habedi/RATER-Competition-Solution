In the article "making monq lisa Smile" itll describe many things on how the new technology can figure out the facial expressions of people. Like it said in the first paragraph in the article "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry."

I think that using this technology in a classroom would be valuable. i think it would because, when a student is acting up in a different way but doesnt really like to show his emotions the computer can detect it and the teacher can help him out through what he is suffering through.

Second, i think it would be a great thing because the facial action coding system could allow us to interact with one another and globalize each other around. i think this becuase their are times when students are mad and fired up and just do not want to be bothered so using this can help out a lot. This new technology can benefit the teachers too because they can know what his or hr students are feeling whether they're bored, about to fall asleep becuase then they can figure out another way to figure out a way to teach the class in a better sucessful way.

Third, the system can a smile to your face when you realize what the computer is capable of and not only will it detect that also the little facial expressions you make time to time such as confusement, boredum and ETc.

In conclusion i do think that the facial acting coding program is a good one and should be allowed in classrooms because it could help each other out and the teachers by makking the class a little better just by a different way of teaching. not only the education but also with being friends and your family because now you can check up on them.
