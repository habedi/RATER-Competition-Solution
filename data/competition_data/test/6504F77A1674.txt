Some student would love to work on school work at home, due to the lack of sleep and possibly health issues. Working from home can teach students what its like to be independent and responsible. Some students wake up to being home alone in the mornings, some students have parents home or siblings home in the morning. Online classes would help students work at their own pace, along with teaching them how to be responsible. Some kids are just not motivated to get up in the mornings to go to school and deal with the same situation over and over again. As one of those students i feel as if online schooling would help the kids who are having a hard time getting up in the morning, to go to school and deal with stressful and anxiety inducing situations.

Students who have a hard time finding a reason to get up in the morning, hard time finding motivation, would probably prefer to do their school work at home. Some students and social anxiety, some suffer from depression, and some suffer from sleeping issues. We need to keep in mind that not all students are the same and all have a personal life to include some issues here and there. Some students may have tried to talk about this and no one has acknowledged their idea, which causes them to be more stressed and feel dismissed. Being one of these students i would also like to share that doing school online may be more stressful to some students, but others would much rather deal with the stress of doing online school than go to school and feel dismissed.

Students have to go to school and deal with people bullying them, and deal with other students that have no respect what so ever. Some kids dont want to be around that or have developed problems due to having to deal with bullying or feeling alone and dismissed. Many kids get up in the morning and face all of that head on and dont speak on the issue because they want to get it done and over with, but little does everyone know that a person can only take but so much of the same thing before it becomes a major problem not only for them, but for others as well. Students and kids should have to feel the way that they do growing up into an adult, some people say "you're learning how to be an adult."

Students, to include me, would feel way more comfortable working from how, rather than coming into school and dealing with the same situations over and over again. The skills it takes to learn online would help older teens and young adults learn what its like to be responsible for your own things, without teachers giving them the free pass. If you dont have something you need for online school than you cant learn, causing you to fall way behind and more likely to redo the class.

Not only will students learn the importance of being responsible, they'll also learn the importance of time management. Young students should be able to learn without feeling like they have no choice. Students who are on the line of becoming 18 and up should be able to have a say in their education.

We also have to keep in mind of students home situation, if the student is becoming or is 18, we need to think about their home situation. Some of them might not have a home or parents to help them. If they go through the school they should be able to do online schooling. With that being said I feel as if student should be able to choose to finish high school online, as well as be able to express why they'd feel better off doing online school. A student choosing to do online school seems so much better than a student choosing to drop out in my opinion. I feel like the online school option would reduce the number of drop outs by a lot.

Students would feel like they have a say in their education along side being heard. The amount of school days being missed by student would go down as well because they wouldnt feel pressured into doing something they have no interest in doing. Graduation number would go up due to more students participating in classes even if its alone schooling.
