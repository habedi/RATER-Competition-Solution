Dear Principal,

I think it is necessary to require kids to do some amount of community service. I firmly believe this because kids need to learn how to help people and not just themselves! A perfect way of learning this is community service.

Children tend to get overly involved with themselves these days. As if when they don't get something they really want they are mad and sit themselves in their room all night.

I think a good amount of community service a teen should have to do is twelve hours by the end of 8th grade. Twelve hours may seem like a lot but helping others is a perfect thing you can do with your friends. Helping can be fun. Twelve hours if you break it down and we go for three hours you would only need to go four times and if there are nine months we have school then you would only need to go one every two months; and not even that.

We could have a 8th grade trip to Feed My Starving Children. we could have half of the 8th grade go in the morning the other in the afternoon. We could have everyone sign up for when they wanted to go and that would make it so they could choose who to go with, and that could give us two and a half hours to add to our list.

I also think that if they perform more that the required twelve hours that they should get a bigger and bigger award the more they perform.

Also if we do say it is required to do community service we should not be able to collect tips. I know from experience that people like to try to give tips if you are serving them or something.

I do strongly believe that teens should learn to help people by way of community service. My reasons for thinking this are; teens are too self-centered and they need to learn to help others.

Sincerely,

Student
