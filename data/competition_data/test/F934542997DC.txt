Students that live far away from schools or live on small towns apart from the city, deseve the opportunites to have the same education like the rest of the people. Providing the option to assist school without leave home. Students on this situation should take adavntage of these opportunities, to become a successful person in life, desomstrate themselves and the world that nothing is impossible and thank the people who are making that possible.

Shcool is paramount on chidren education, and parents do everything to educate their youth. To be successful in this life, work hard and never give up are the main ideas that peole have in mind every day. In my case, I woke up every day by 5:30 in the morning, then I took a shower,I get ready for school and then I took the bus by 6:45. After that, I arrive to school and take four diferent classes, after school, I work eight hours straight on chick-fill-a. Finally go home to get ready for the nex day. "All the sacrfice that you do will be recompence one day " my mother always said.

Demostrate the world that nothing is impossible is the best thing that people can do. Be themselves and do not care what people would say about it is the goal. For exaple, me as a hispanic guy, people never tought that I was going to learn engish in less than a year. I challenged myself three years ago to learn english and with out the help of family and teachers that wouldn't never happend. Now Im a member of the National Honor Society and Im graduating in my junior year of high school. Do never give up and keep fighting.

Be thankfull in this life is important, and thnak the people who are offering distance learnig as an option, those persons are changing students lifes. Thank is one of the best expretions that the humanity can do. In my position, I will never end to thank my ESL techer for everything she sacrifice for us. My parents, the rest of my family, and God. They are my support every day of my life.

Sudents who are far away from school would be more than happy to attend classes from home, getting in the process of training and developing their skill and make them the furure of the country. Now, Are you ready to built your own challenge ? You have many opportunities as you want , take them and make them true. Look up for the best and be humble, we are all equal. Good luck.
