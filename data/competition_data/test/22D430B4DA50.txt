Seagoing cowboys program is a once in a life time opportunity you get to explore different parts of the world. If you like animals and always wanted to travel the world well this is your channce trust me hi my name is Luke Bomberger i have been to many cuntries China,italy, New Orleans,Europe,Rome italy,panama canals.

You might as well get to see more places than i did think about all the places you will get to go to. Get to explore the Atlantic ocean, the Pacific ocean. It will be like a vacation for you but way more exiting that also includes some dagerous moments i was once the noight watchman i slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as i shot feet first toward and opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped me from slidding,keeping me from flying overboard into the dark antlantic ocean.

Every job has its risks but its very fun you get to see the ocean and the stars at night the moon glowing and the ocean reflecting its beutiful light. hope to see you here at the seagoing cowboy program.
