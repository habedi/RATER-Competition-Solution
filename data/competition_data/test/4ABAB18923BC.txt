The reason I think you guys/girls should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program is because you would have lots of fun and see lots of animals. Also, you can ride horses and catch cattle running away.

Also you may be able to meet new friends and see your friends there as well. And, your guys/girls could sleep with your best friends in the same cabin in bunkbeds. you can also make your own breakfast.

Some people may help you with other things like cleaning, working, and catching animals if you are just starting out. Also if you live in America you can take a boat there. You may see some of your relitives and kids you might make new friends.

Did you know that when you go there you can...... play with the animals and sleep in the barn that they have and train with Cowboy stuff. And you will get as messy as a pig in mud when you go there.

So I am going to start to rap things up and going to say ''Come on down to Seagoing Cowboys Program.'' So this is my last thing that I am going to say this goodbye and come on down now i have to go have some fun. BYE!!!
