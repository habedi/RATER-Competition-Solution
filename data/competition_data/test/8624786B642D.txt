The Facial Action Coding System, created by Dr. Huang and his colleague, was put into place to recognize human emotions. This technology has lots of positives and very few negatives. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is a reliable piece of technology that can be very valuable in a classroom setting.

This new technology can read the emotions/expressions of students while they are doing work on the computers. It can tell whether a student is enjoying what they are doing are if the absolutley despise the work. Dr. Huang predicts that "A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This is showing how benificial this new technogly is to not only a student but also a teaacher. If a student is struggling or just doesn't want to do the work that is presented to them then the computer can "modify the lesson" to fit the needs of the students. This also takes stress off the teachers shoulders, now they don't have to walk around the class to answer every single question.

One might say that this new technology can limit student-teacher interactions, which is not benficiary to the students at all. One might also say that this type technology will lead students to become more dependant on technology then the Teacher. These can be proven true but a majority of our communication is nonverbal. Dr. Huang states "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang. "So computers need to understand that, too." This is basically saying that since most of our communication is nonverbal we might as well add computers into the mix. which is very smart.

One can conclude that the Facial Action Coding System can be very valuable to classrooms, because they can modify lessons if students show some type of negative emotion towards it. It also takes the stress of teachers and limits the questions being asked.
