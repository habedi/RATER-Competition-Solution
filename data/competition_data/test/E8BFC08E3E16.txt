Driveless Cars are the future? Many may think so but some may oppose them. The're people whom think they should be the ones controlling the car not the other way around. But why not let the people who want them have it, yes some maybe be lazy not wanting to drive. Others would just like to relax while being in their cars. Yes I do believe this cars should be continued to be developed, but people should still have some kind of control of those cars.

Many just think that just because those cars are selfdrive that people dont have to worry about driving. They are wrong they still should be able to take over in cast of en emergancy or if they just want too drive instead. They would also have to stay awake and watch if the car is going the right way or something. Meaning that you would still have control over your car and tell it what to do. So that way if there happen to be en accident they cant blame you for it. Also in many cases you or the manufacturer would be blame but I believe the police should dig deep and see whos fault really was and not just blame someone for believing it was them.

Driveless Cars should be continued to be developed as technology is the future. Yes many may believe that people are just letting others do the working for them. But its the 21th centery. We should be able to keep expanding our technology to everything and everywhere. Including cars as it could help to not have as many accidents as we now have. It would be a win for everyone as they also use half the gas taxis use now days. Plus you'll still have control over your cars but you can also just relax whenever you want.
