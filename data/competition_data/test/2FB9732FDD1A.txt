Dear Principle, i feel that doing community service is a good thing to do but it is also a thing that you should choose to do like when OTHER_NAME went and did it she said that it was fun and when she had gotten done with it she said that she felt better and she felt like she had did a really good thing for her and for her community and also for her family I also feel like you should be able to choose if you want to help others because in school and in life you don't have allot of choices that you can make by your self and i feel that in middle school, and also high school you should be able to make choices and make good choices and feel good and happy about your choices also i think that if you made it a rule that every kid had to perform service it then i feel like you would have more problems with wanting to do it and having to do it because i feel that community service is one of those things that you should want to do not because you have to.

Another take that i have is that it is a good thing for people that are trouble makers and have no respect because it shows them that they are more fortunate for what they have and show them how good they really got it also i feel like it would change them as a person and it would change the way they act in front of other people and the way they act as a citizen so i feel that it is up to you weather or not you want to do good for others and even yourself.

sincerely,
