Venus is one of the closest planets to earth, infact its known as our sister planet and sometimes even reffered to as Earth's "twin." Though the planet is so close, its hasn't been the easiest to get to or explore. Exploring Venus might be a big challenge, but scientists part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aren't ready to give up yet. Numerous failed attempts have not affected them or their work. It might be because of their fascination of the planet or because the exploration of this planet will greatly increase their knowledge of what the planet once was. Throughout the passage the readers can see how the author agrees and supports the idea of exploring Venus.

In paragraph 8 the author states, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by the dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." When the author says this he is supporting the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because he is saying that we should not let the challenge and trouble of venus stop us from trying to explore it. The author also supports this claim in paragraph 4 when he says, "Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been te most Earth-like planet in our solar system," he then follows the sentence up with examples of characteristics both planets share like valleys, mountrains, and craters. The author does this to show that if we were able toe explore it we would add more to the research and information we already know about the planet.
