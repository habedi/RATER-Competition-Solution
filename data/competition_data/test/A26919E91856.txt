Dear Principal,

Cell phones are a huge problem in our world today. Letting students bring cell phones into school under any situation, can cause a problem.

More students in our world today use cell phones for texting and just talking to people when they want to. They never use it just for an emergency, and most of a students time is put towards any electronic device. This being said, it would be a very irresponsible thing to do. Students see each other at school all day and week long. When they can't talk to each other in the middle of class they can just simply pull out their phone and start to text each other and the teacher will never know. It just shows students that they can get away with more things than to actually pay attention in class like they need to. The more students do things like sneaking phones in the middle of class, the more it shows them that they can do anything, as long as the teachers don't know about anything that they do. It becomes a habit. It is like a drug that bounds you to it and has you so sucked in that you can't hear or do anything while you're in it.

Students don't need cell phones in school. They have each other to talk to verbally in their spare time. Phones are just going to make it more difficult for the teachers and other authorities to get students under control when they need to. A student shouldn't be stuck up in an electronic device all day long, and especially when they are at school. It is proven that students who pay more attention to a device than read or go outside to get some exercise tend to gain weight and do worse in school. To help less kids end up like this by the time they are done with high-school, the less phones there are in schools the better that students will improve on their grades and social skills, and weight.

These are the important reasons to why cell phones should be in school. It will make schools better and a better life for the students.
