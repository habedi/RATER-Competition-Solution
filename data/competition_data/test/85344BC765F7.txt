Schools should allow distance learning as an alternative to attending class physically. Many students would most likely feel more comfortable having the option of doing this. Meaning that they would possibly work more effectively than if they were in class, or if students had to miss school due to being sick they could stay caught up while gone. These students could also use this option as a partial mental health day, they would be able to complete their work but not have to deal with the stressful location that is school. Distance learning would benefit students that are unable to attend school for a period of time, whether this is from sickness or any other reason; although some students may try to take advantage of this system it will overall be beneficial.

Furthermore, students who happen to get sick in the current school system usually end up taking several days getting caught up in the work they missed. Currently missing a day of school can be detrimental to a students overall grade because they missed material that they would then have to learn on their own without the help of a teacher. Students who have to miss several days are at an even greater disadvantage due to the same reasons multiplying as the days go on. Due to this reason distance learning would allow students to maintain the same level of learning as their pears while they are gone allowing them to continue having a consistent grade. Although some may argue that the learning done at home wouldn't be as beneficial as the learning done at school, they may be right to some regard, but the learning that would be done at home with the same resources and real time access to their teacher would help the student far more that having to catch up on work and new material missed.

The ability to learn while traveling, with access to the school's materials or access to a real time classroom, would allow students to venture out with their families and not disrupt or shift any of the family events put in place. This would mean that the family could travel freely without the constraint of their child having to make it to school. The student, or child in this case, would be able to complete their work while still being able to have fun with their family while they are away. Some students may neglect their work while they are away and this could be blamed on them not having a teacher to hold them accountable; however, some students neglect their work while in class and a traditional learning environment and it comes down to the student's own work ethic more than their location.

A break from a traditional learning environment may be beneficial to students. As with whenever someone has to stay still somewhere for an extended duration of time, people get bored. They slowly lose the ability to focus on their work or the teacher in front of them, once a student begins to lose focus it is hard to get them back to learning. Allowing students to have the ability to have a change of scenery could help improve their overall work ethic. The location being different would mean that students could have a break from their repetitive day to day lives, students would also be able to take short breaks to recharge before getting back to work. There will always be those who would not be able to complete work outside of a traditional school environment, many students however would be able to complete their day to day tasks just as well if not better with a change. A repetitive day to day life will eventually become boring but with a chance to try something different for a change would benefit students.

Many students would be able to benefit from the ability to work from outside of a traditional schooling area. Whether the reason is them being sick, needing a day away, even a family vacation or event that is taking place. Students that have the opportunity to work outside of the classroom would most likely see improvement to their scores, because they would have the opportunity to recharge. They would also have the ability to stay caught up in work while they are away. Some arguments may be made about how distance learning would give students a chance to slack off, not get their work done, or to just cut school and these are all valid claims; although many would use this opportunity so maintain their grades and remain caught up in the classes that they would have otherwise missed.
