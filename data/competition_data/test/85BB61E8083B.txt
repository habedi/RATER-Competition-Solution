I Think is a great technology to now the students emotional expresions,and now their felings with that technology and can prevent allout of things. the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of FACS [ Facial,Action Coding system]. Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happines,surprise, anger,disgust,fear,and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. In my conclusion imagine a computer that knows when you' re happy or sad that is awesome in my opinion that is Great we can prevent bullyng in the future bring help for students and other people, we can now if the student or person is in difficult times in her life or is happy in my conclusion i think that this technology will help the people in the future, the New Software is A great job that is my conclusion Thanks you.
