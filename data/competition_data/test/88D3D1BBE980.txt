Driverless cars are starting to make an appearance in the world. There are postive and negative ideas about these new cars. Threre are ways it can effect the world and help it and other ways. Some like the idea of these new driverless cars and some do not like it.

I personally would like to live in a time like this. There are a lot of new ideas coming along that can change and help the world become a better place. Driverless cars can help the world in many ways, from taxi systems to gas money, and even pollution. The taxi system would haul people to and from work,school,mettings, or even if you're just going out. This would lead to more money you would not have to speend on gas. The less money you spend on gas the less pollution in the world.

I could also see why driverless cars can also have a big negative impact. Even though they are not completley driveless yet, they still have some small risk. If a driveless car approaches a construction zone the car can not go through the zone by itself, it would have to be under human control. If you are in a hurry and need to get somewhere quick it would be wise not to hop into one of these cars, driving time is a lot slower in these than in normal cars. Another reason why they put humans at risk is the car wrecks. Most of these wrecks would be because of computer error, and they have fixed these to work perfect. It may not be a good idea to take this in a snow storm but Google cofounder says they have not had a car accident in more than half a million trips in their driverless cars.

Overal I believe this is the way the world needs to work, it would positivley help the Earth more than hurt it. The ways it would change the atomassphere, by pollution and less wrecks. People who dont like the idea need to think of the positives.
