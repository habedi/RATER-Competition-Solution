I think its a good idea to have emotional expression in school and here's my reason why , its good to have something that with help a student to become susseful in life. The way it can help is that, it can help to help a student by if they get confused, loss and bored. the emotion type senear can let the teacher know or the computer know is that the student is sturgging, In the article at (pg 6) it said "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,". the computer can also can help someone in class with depression or saddness and the school can help them. it can read the muscule on the face to tell which face expression its doing. in (pg8) it say that " muscles called orbicularis"

"zygomatic major and a different muscule,". In conclusion i think its a good idea to bring out in to the world, also help out in class.
