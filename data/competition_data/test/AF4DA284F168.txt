Why should luke join this program? Luke should join the program because its a opportunity of a lifetime. Plus, he gets to spend time with his friend. Lastly he will experence new things. Its a good thing he went on with going to do the program cause it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

This program will be a opportunity of a lifetime. In the prompt it states that he couldn't say no to his friend, and that he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Secondly Luke says "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small-town boy." Besides helping others he likes to taking water rides Venice, Italy. Thrirdly Luke was able to tour excavated castle in Crete and Marveled. But mostly went there to spend time with his friend.

Luke didn't go to the program he went there to see his friend. First he gets a phone call from his friend saying "Hey would you like to come over to Europe then asked about cattle boating. His friend Don Reist confnced him to come out and see him, but not only see him but to go cattle boating with him. But yet not only did Luke do the program and gets to hang out with his friends he gets to experence new thngs.

Luke was able to experence new things while on this trip, and learn some to. World war 2 was over in 1945. Luke was a watchman and he had to check on the animals every hour. Luke found time to have fun the cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table tennis, and more.

In conclusion, I think Luke choose the right chose because he would still be doing the same thing being a cowboy and farming. Since he went cattle boating he's not the same in a good way. Also it was good to go see his friend and cattle boat with him to. These are my reasons why Luke should join.
