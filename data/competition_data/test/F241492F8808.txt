It is really sad to see my cousin went through that. My cousin was sick, she could not go to public school. She took classes online. Both of her parents died, when she was a baby. My family took care of her ever since. My cousin didn't have any friends besides my family. she wanted to make new friends, and meet them. She was very confident, and had a great personality. One day, it was her birthday, I planned her a surprise party to introduce her to all of my friends. So she could talk to them, hoping they will get along, but it was too late. She died in her room. Nobody knew what happened. I disagree. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because students do not get to experience a lot of things in their lives, It is hard to understand what teachers are teaching, when students are not in the presence, online school is not the same as a regular school.

First, students do not get to experience a lot of things in their lives, such as; prom, events, or other school's activities. My cousin used to dress me up, whenever there is a program in my school. My dream was to do something nice for her in return that she would remember wherever she is, sadly, I did not get the chance to do that for her. Although It did not cry in her funeral, but I did it in my room. She hated seeing me cry. she used to tell me, "Be Strong." and I took her advice with me wherever I go. I just wish my cousin were not sick. She would have get the chance to meet my new friends, go to public school and do those fun activities in my school with me. She was my best friends, my soul, my everything. There is still going to be a piece of my heart that will always misses her.

Secondly, it is hard to understand what teachers are teaching, when students are not in the presence. For me, If I am not in a class, or I miss a day, and a teacher has taught something to the other students. I will never understand what has taught in that class without an explanation. When I type something within when I write it down with my own handwriting, there is a difference between them. With my handwriting, it helps me stay focused, study faster, but with typing, I feel lazy, I can not remember anything in my mind. However, for some students, online school is such a good thing for them. They can wake up late, online school helps people with disabilities or sick, who are scared to go outside of the world. They are either home schooled, or they learn things on the internet.

Last but not least, online school is not the same as a regular public school, because in public school, students get to hang out with their friends and couples after school and walk them outside of the school. Students can work as teammates, do group study, ask each other questions and communicate. I enjoy that everyday with my friends. When it is holiday, the school let students wear their favorites costume to school. Students can never do any of those kind of fun on an online school or home school. Students can not make real friends there. It is like, reading a book in a library by myself. Public school is more interesting than online school.

Lastly, I can not imagine to be on an online school, because I know it would make me lazy. It would make me feel confused and bored. I do not want to experience a life like that. I do not want to end up like my cousin. She used to complain about how online school was boring for her. She did not like it, but she did not have other option. Her dream was to go to the same school as me, and enjoy herself. She was someone that anyone would like. She was funny, and never felt disgusted by anything. Students do not get to experience a lot of things in their lives, It is hard to understand what teachers are teaching, when students are not in the presence, online school is not the same as regular school. In order to learn, understand better, have fun and hang out with real friends. The right place is to come to public school.
