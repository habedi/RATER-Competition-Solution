Venus is a place in space where astronauts may go to. Venus is has the hottest surface temperture of any planet on the solar system. Venus is the second close planet to the sun because Mercury is the first that is closest to the sun. Venus is sometimes called the Evening Star because it is one of the brightest points of lights in the night sky. Some people may think that that Venus is one of the most dangerous planet in the solar system.

On the planet surface tempertures can get up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what weve experience in our own planet. Venus has the hottest temperture of all the planets in our solar system. Venus is the hottest even when Mercury is closest to the sun. Some numerous factors have think that Venus is challenging planet for humans to study.

Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on the cloud-draped world. Each spacecraft they sent was unmanned. Venus is the dangerous because no spacecraft they sent survived the landing for more than a few few hours. Im assuming this is why not a single spaceship touched down in Venus for more than three decades.

NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. They are running test on the surface because of the chaos that has happened. They are looking back on old technology which was called the mechanical computers. This was evented in the 1800s. The studying that they are having I think that it shouldn't be anymore problems with spacecrafts or anything going to Venus.
