Fellow citizens, cars are starting to become a great issue in todays society. The gases they give off are very harmful to our community. Cars are also making more people overweight. This is because its much easier to drive 2 miles to work rather than walk and get hot and sweaty.

In the article, it provides information about cars hurting our planet. Basically the issues are greenhouse gases. These gases that our vehicles give off are polluting our air to the point where its harmful to live here. Because of this, I feel that we need to limit car use throughout the United States.

In doing this, I honestly feel like we can stop the pollution, or at least slow it down. Eventually there will be technological advancements that will help us solve problems such as this. But until then, we need to come up with a plan to slow down car usage and air pollution.

Our people are also becoming more lazy as the progression of cars continues. What im saying is people would rather ride around in a car over getting outside and walking and enjoying our surroundings. This effects the world more than you think. The more lazy and out of shape people are, the less jobs can be filled because theres not someone in shape enough to handle it.

Overall, our car usage either needs to come to a hault or at least slow down a great amount. All the US has focused on since world war 2 is the advancement of cars. I strongly belive that now is the time to change that and end this pollution problem.
