I think using this technology to read students emotional expressions during class would be awesome! A lot of kids get board in class and usually get on their phone instead of listening to there teacher. By using this device to scan the whole room and detech the emotions of students, teachers would know more about how we feel about there class and the subject. Teachers could make class more intreastig and kids would want to come to school. The Facial Action Coding System is a great way to make learning fun for students as well for teachers.

The way it works is it begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; then 44 major muscles in the picture must move like human muscles. The movement of one or more muscles is called "action unit." the emotions it detechs is happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Baggy eyes make a difference. you could be happy or sad, but The Facial Action Coding System will notice something wrong with your facial muscles and could determend the wrong emotions.

"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving you facial muscles not only to express emotions, but it also helps produce them. If you fake smile, it actually works and will make you happy. feeling somebody elses emotional state could also have a impact on it. This happens because us Humans unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions.

That being said, This Facial Action Coding System could be used in classrooms to help see if students are board and could help teachers make the lessons more intresting. The System isnt always 100% right. any little false face muscle expression could ruin your whole test. So if you plan on taking the test make sure to have a good nights rest the day before and also make sure your picture is cear and you could se every muscle in you face because it helps identify you emotions and feelings.
