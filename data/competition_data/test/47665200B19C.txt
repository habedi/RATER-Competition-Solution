I was planning a project with a group of friends for our Spanish class it was dreadful. The teacher had given us another boring topic none of us were even close to interested about, we did the bare minimum yet still had achieved a solid high grade. And in little to no time we all had already completely forgotten about the topic. School summer assignments should be student, not teacher based because Freedom promotes curiosity, Students will work harder for something they care about and Freedom provides creativity.

First of all Freedom promotes curiosity, for example my mother is a famous singer here in the United States, every year Genric_City invites her to sing the national anthem and at my house we have medals and awards on every wall, my dad is a very talented guitarist who has been playing since he was six. Although they have always loved music they never pushed or forced us to try music for me and my little brother. My little brother got completely sucked into music and started teaching himself how to play the guitar, his curiosity is what led him where he is today. My little brother has been playing for less than a year and a half and has already played with my mom in concerts with up to five thousand people. My parents had very little to no influence to my brother because they never forced us to play. Some may believe otherwise because they might say freedom is what makes kids or teens rebellious and that thinking is reasonable but flawed due to the fact that being a bit rebellious is what gives kids or teens life experience. Albert Einstein one of the smartest men there have ever stepped foot on our planet was rebellious and would rarely attend class because his curiosity and freedom are what drove him.

Secondly, Students will work harder for the things they want and are interested in. If you have interest and motivation in something it will drive you not only to finish faster but to want to learn more. We always hear the phrase "When you get a job pick something you will love to do the rest of your life" otherwise your time is wasted and you are just stuck on a dead end job and doing tasks you have no interest in. My uncle Genric_Name always wanted to have his very own restaurant because he loved to cook and it was one of his hobbies but my grandpa has always forced and pushed him into taking law because in south America, which is where they live, he was very strict because he wanted to have his son have a well respected job title but soon enough the years passed and he realized he as stuck at an office when all he wanted to do was leave and open his restaurant. Not long after that he quit his office job and opened his very own restaurants where he is today. Some may disagree with this idea because they think you can adapt or get used to liking something but that reasoning is flawed to the fact that some people simply never adapt or get used to something they dont enjoy doing. For Example Gareth Bale a famous soccer player from Wales plays for Real Madrid a muti-million euro Spanish soccer club where he gets paid thousands of euros and has a full career but when Bale is injured he goes to play professional golf he loves soccer but he never got used to playing only soccer he also considered quitting the Spanish club only to go play soccer but he untimely stayed in soccer, even though if he quit he would of not only lost alot of money but he would have sacrificed it to do something he enjoys and that is worth respecting.

Another reason that school summer projects should be student based is because Freedom promotes creativity one example of this is when I was in tenth grade my teacher, Genric_Name assigned all of us a element from the table and we were all expecting a full layout and a rubric but we didnt get one. Instead he told us it was completely up to us on how we represented the element and he would want to see some sort of presentation at the end. At first everyone was confused and a bit shocked since this was the first time a project had been completely up to them

As the deadline approached the day of presentations I had done a very creative slideshow and poster of the element Neon which I had glued glow sticks everywhere to get the full effect. As I walked into the classroom I saw all sorts of visuals about elements I had never even imagined it was interesting to see so many people with different projects but there were none alike every one had brought something completely different. Some may disagree with this idea because of too much freedom being bad for a person, but that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that freedom is what lets people make their own mistakes and if they don't have the ability to try something when they think about trying something they will be scared of messing up.

In conclusion giving students the ability to chose and the freedom to make their own choices when it comes to education is better than always having the same structure, the same rubric and the same level of comfort. Getting out of you comfort zone with what gives a person their sense of purpose. A change is needed in a society where people are encouraged to think different why would you limit the future of America and remain making decisions for them, instead of letting them think for themselves when they're young so theyre able to better manage our and your future? Let people think for themselves instead of forcing them to think a certain way and not be able to explore their own paths and ideas.
