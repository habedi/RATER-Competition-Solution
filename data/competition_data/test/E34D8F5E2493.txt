Going home on time after school everyday gets boring most of the time, but what is not boring are extracurricular activities. Instead of going home you could have fun after school with your friends. Playing sports or doing clubs are a great way to do that. Like in sixth grade I played tennis for my school and now in eighth grade I play JV lacrosse for my middle school. If you don't make a team sign up for a club of your interest. Extracurricular activities are good because they help with stress, helps you learn and problem solve, and also gives parents more free time.

Stress is a big problem for middleschoolers and highschoolers. Extracurricular activities help with stress and keep students mentally healthy. For example when I have a lot of homework or a project due I get very stressed, But going to lacrosse practice gets my mind off that and I have a good time. Or even during the school day when I have been working hard going to Jr. Beta club and talking to friends helps. Trust me when I say sports or clubs will help with stress.

Not only do extracurricular activities help with stress they also help with learning and problem solving. In life you are going to need to know how to problem solve, whether you have a job or you are just helping somebody. At lacrosse sometimes I will do something wrong and coach will get mad at me. I get very mad sometimes, but don't learn from your mistakes and correct them next time. After school activities really help with learning and problem solving.

Your parents play very big roles in your life and sometimes they need a little extra rest. When your not home on time everyday it gives them time to either rest or do what they need to do. Sometimes at school I get a little tired and my teacher will give the class a break for a couple minutes to just clear they minds and stress. Your parents need to do this sometimes to. They do every thing for us, and extracurricular activities give them some needed free time.

Extracurricular activities are really fun and enjoyable. They deal with stress, help you learn and solve problems, and gives you guardians time to rest. Yes it is better then just going home on the bus like usual. So go try out for a team or sign up for a club you won't regret it.
