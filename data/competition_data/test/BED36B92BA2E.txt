Hello! Today you problem feel super board with nothing to do,but you really love adventure. I know what to do I'll tell you what my friend Luke's friend did for him. Lucks friend Don Reist invited him to toto Europe on a cattle boat. Luke said yes, and began a whole new adventure. You know that a cattle boat is not as bad as it sounds. You should tell yourself should I.

Here are a few reasons why you should consider going.

<It would be a lot of fun

< You love trying new things

<You also like adventure,and trust this is a chance of a life time at least Luke thinks so.

You should remember that these are only a few reasons to try there are tons of more were that came from. I would tell you,but I'm kinda in the middle of taking a HUGE test. I don't wanna spend my time doing that. I want you to at least consider it. I think you could be the best cowboy or cowgirl who rides the waves ever.

This is my conclusion I really hope I have convinced you to try riding the waves if I haven't at least try new things,and never stop be leaving that you can't. You have the world to explore. You are an adventurer,and I can't wait to explore what cool things you can do to like our amazing world.
