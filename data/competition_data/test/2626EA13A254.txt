Have you ever wondered what your emotions were like in an old picture.

This article states that the monalisa was tested to see how happy, disgusted, fearful, and angry.

This new technology could be useful but not all that tactical.

This new technology is mostly likely not very expensive but it is not very useful if it can only be used as an emotion finder.

I believe that this technology for the emotion dectected is basically useless and a waste of money.

This technology to detect emotion is quite weird to spend money on what humans can find out.

If you look at a picture then you should be able to see what emotions they are feeling.

The information that humans could gather would not be as precise as the computers but maybe it would be more accurate.

There are a couple good reasons why you should have this new technology.

this because because of how it decifered the emotions of the monalisa very accuratly.

Such as the 83% happy,9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry.

This information could not be desifered by a human eye.

In conclusion, I believe that this technology is a waste of money and the idea of it should be thrown away.

This is because while someone was wasting their time on a emotion detecter they could have been spending that time on something like better computers or faster computers.

They could have done something better than waste their time and resources on something that humans can do for this technology.
