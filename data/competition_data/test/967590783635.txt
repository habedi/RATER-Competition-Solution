Should people use their cellphones while driving?

People always have something important on their phone or have someone important that they're talking to but is their lives really worth texting someone? There are so many cases of people losing their life while texting and driving. People shouldn't be able to use their phone while behind the wheel of a car.

Is a text message more important than your own life? The person you are or they have been texting could wait but the car you are driving can't and requires all the alertness you have in order to be safe behind the wheel. Your life and the lives of others are always at stake when you're are driving. There already so many accidents happening on the road and one of those main causes of those accidents happening are caused by people who were texting and driving. There are laws saying that it is illegal for you to be texting and driving.

If you were to cause an accident because you were texting and driving and end someone's life because of that accident you will be held responsible for that person's death and will actually serve time in jail or in prison. Throughout most of the states of the United States of America it is actually very illegal for someone to be texting and driving.

You will actually be charged if you get pulled for texting and driving because you are risking your life and the lives of others on the road.

I personally think that it shouldn't be something people should be doing in general. Mostly because the lives of others are at stake when someone is texting and driving and could actually lose their life because of it. It distracts the driver from focusing on the road and so many things could go wrong on the road whether there is a drunk driver or construction. Texting isn't as important as your life and the lives of other people.

Texting and driving isn't something people should or do in general. Luckily there's laws saying to not text and drive but some people don't listen and there is still risk of accidents happening because of this. People should see the bad side of texting and driving rather than answering someone's text message.
