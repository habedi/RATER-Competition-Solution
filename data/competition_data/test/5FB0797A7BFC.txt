Do you wanna be successful in every aspect of your life? Well I believe that it would be a great idea to have every students participate in a extracurricular activity. Because one it would keep every student focused on something positive. Second it could help them get into college or get a good job. Not to mention it could give them learning experiences and keep them out of trouble.

One reason I believe that it would be a good idea is because it would keep students focused on something. For example if a kid decides to try out a sport they could fall in love with it so they work hard at it. So not only could they put that work ethic in the sport they could also put it in the classroom. This can also ready students for the work world when you have to be motivated to do stuff.

Another benefit of every kid doing a extra activity is that it could help get them into a college. Like if you do volunteering at an old folks home that could help out a lot. Or if you did something like charity work. playing sports can also help you get into a good college. Not only could that help with getting in college but also help you get a job, etc.

Also if you do activities it can help you stay out of trouble. EspeciallyÂ if your a kid that does get in trouble a lot this can help you eliminate bad influences , distractions, etc. it can also give you good learning experiences. So if you have an activity going on it will help you greatly with staying out of trouble.

To conclude I think extra curricular activities would be very positive for students. It could help your work ethic. It can help you focus your time and every in to something positive. Help you with getting into college or a job. It can also help you stay out of trouble.
