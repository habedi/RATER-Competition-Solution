There are multiple reasons why I disagree with this topic. First transportation, Second over crowding, Third no time for homework. Also it would cost the school more money to keep more kids after school which would increase the schools expense. Those are just a few reasons I am sure that there are multiple other items I could have chosen for this. These are the ones the I think are the most important.

The first main thing I would like to talk about is transportation. Transportation is a huge thing with sports and parents sometimes a child has to get rides if they want to play sports because their parents work late and can not pick them up or drop them off. Parents have to compromise with their child and find a way for them to play sports. Also if every student has to play a sport or do some sort of extra curricular activity to go to high school then there is no need to have bus drivers. Which creates less jobs and takes more time for kids to get home.

The second part of this topic I am genuinely concerned with is overcrowding. The reason why I am concerned is because I play sports and I know that not everyone plays sometimes. If every student had to play a sport or do something extra circular then I feel like no one would play because the coaches dont have time to work all of the players into the game, they do try but they don't always succeed. Also if you do sports or you sign up for a club like yearbook club or chess club. There are going to be more people that show up than normal then that club or sport might have to spend more money to get enough equipment for the new members.

The next part of this topic that concerns me is that with all of these new members to clubs and teams that practices will have to be later so every kid can have a turn and get the practice that they need to become successful in that sport. With the practices being later and later then kids will not have time for their homework or staying up later to get their home work done. All of that can cause the child to not sleep, it can cause more stress, to be falling asleep in class and to not pay attention in class. Which then may lead to failing tests or eventually failing classes. By participating in sports or clubs that alone might just add stress to your life and school might already be stressful enough so I think that just even for your own mental health that not everyone should be balancing school and sports.

As I have mentioned before I completely disagree with this. I do not think that students should have to play a sport or do anything extra curricular to proceed to high school. Another thing I have mentioned is the three huge topics to show why I disagree including transportation, overcrowding and not playing, not being able to complete homework or even study. Also the school will have to spend more money on equipment for teams and clubs. Just like I've said by making every student do some sort of extra curricular activity it will make the school not have funding for anything else. I am sure that I have missed key topics but these are just the ones I think are extremely important.
