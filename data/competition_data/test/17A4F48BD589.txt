Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am all for requiring a B point average to participate in school activities (such as sports an other events). My main reason is that it would be the perfect incentive for students to maintain good grades because we all know children like to stay active and have a good time playing sports and participating in other events with their peers.

My second reason is so by students working harder to get better grades means developing good study habits . which also means higher test scores.

Lastly i would like to say students that maintain good grades would eventually end up getting into a good collage which means nicer jobs when they get older. someone against me might say its not fair because they're not as smart as the other children. My answer to that would be "by taking away the sports and activities until you maintained a B average might be good for you, so that now you can spend more time on working to your highest potential." Thank you TEACHER_NAME for taking my thoughts into consideration .

Sincerely ,STUDENT_NAME
