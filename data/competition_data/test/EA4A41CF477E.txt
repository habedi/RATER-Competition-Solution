Dear Principal,

Allowing students to have cell phones at school could provide an unproductive learning environment. If students are allowed to have cell phones, they could take advantage of it and use them as distractions. Also, they could get stolen or broken and then provide a lot of trouble for the school. Therefore, I believe that the school should adopt a no cell phone policy.

If students were given the ability to have cell phones at school, they would then take them and use them during class as well. For instance, they might use it to text their friends or cheat on a test. This would provide a distraction from their learning that could cause them to suffer in the future. Also, many new cell phones have calculators on them which could in turn be used on a math test or quiz as an act of academic dishonesty. As a result the ability to carry cell phones at school would prove to be an unwise decision.

In a case in which a cell phone were stolen or broken, it could provide a problem for the student as well as the school. If you brought a cell phone to school and it was stolen for some reason, it would cause a huge disruption. For example, the student's parents would probably be unhappy and then go and talk to the school about it. This would then cause a problem for the school and the person who stole the cell phone. Therefore, in the case of this event it would be easier just to leave the cell phone at home.

Lastly, a cell phone could be used to discompose others. For example, if a person did not have a cell phone, someone else might then have reason to aggravate them or put them down. This could then cause a drop in their self esteem and prove to be very hurtful. In a similar scenario, a student might use a cell phone to upset someone else by texting or spreading rumors about others. As a result, not being able to have cell phones at school could prevent events such as this, and provide a more supportive and encouraging environment.

Although some may argue that they need cell phones to contact their parents in the event of an emergency, the school would be able to provide a phone in the office that would be open to all students. Therefore, there is no case in which a cell phone would be crucial to have. Because of the distraction and complications that cell phones could cause, they should not be allowed on the school campus.

Sincerely,
