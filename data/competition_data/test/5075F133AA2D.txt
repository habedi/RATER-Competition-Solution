Dear Principal,

I am writing you this letter to inform you that I think that you should require students to do community service. It will help them be more responsible and trustworthy. It will have a lot of affect on them to give respect to keeping the school clean, for siblings and for classmates. I think that you should give them a certain amount of time of community to do so that they can still do what they want to do but it still should be required to do. Then after its done, for those who do it give them a prize then the others will want to do it and eventually you have everyone want to do it. Then they will be doing it because they want to not have to. Also, the school and school grounds will be kept more clean because the students don't want others coming and liter and dirty something they just cleaned up. Me, personally, I would not mind cleaning up or helping out because I'm doing it for a cause. This might also help keep students out of doing something they have no need doing. So this will keep them out of getting in trouble somewhere. So in conclusion I say I think it is a good idea with these ideas I explained to you.

Sincerely Your Student,

STUDENT_NAME
