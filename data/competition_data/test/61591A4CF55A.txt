I am Luke and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. If you ever get a chance to be a Seagoing Cowboy you better take the job because their is a lot of cool things you can see.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a very unique thing to do. You can go to different Countries and see very fragile things. When I was on my way to China I toured an excavated castle in Crete. Then I had marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are so many things you can do and see.

The Seagoing cowboy is also special because you can spend time with nature on the sea. I had went to many differnt places and had fun spending time with the animals. I get to feed them oats and give them water and some other things snd you get to clean out there pins. Then the animals will keep you busy and that is why I like it.

Another thing I did was taking night time watch. Watching the animals at night is very cool and every hour you get too go up and tell the captain what is going on. But on the rainy nights you have to be careful. One night I was walking down the steps and slipped and about fell into the dark ocean. That night I knew I had to be more careful.

There are alot of things you can witness as a Seagoing Cowboy. Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of unique Oppertunities and if you get the chance to be one you better take the job and you will witness cool places.
