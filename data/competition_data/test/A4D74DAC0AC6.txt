Driverless cars shouldn't be coming honestly. In my opinion, I don't like the idea of driverless cars very much. It seems a little bit too risky for me; but I'm going to give some reasons why it would actually be a good reason to have driverless cars. First, you would be able to just sit back and relax and watch the road while you're waiting for your turn to drive. Second, you could also grab something on the floor while your in the drivers seat, like if your kid dropped something in the back of the car and they can't grab it, you can try to grab it because the car will be in motion by itself, but you still need to be very cautious on the roads at all times. Third, if you were running late to work or where ever you needed to be, you can make a quick phone call or send out a text and tell them that you will be late for whatever reasons.

Now, lets talk about the negative things. Some of the negative things I don't like about this is that what is the speakers in the car went out and you ca't hear the manufactuer of the car tell you when to take the wheel, or if the car automatically went out of control and you had no poweer or stering of the wheel; you'll be screwed then. To be completely honest, I wouldn't even try to drive a criverless car because I need to know for sure that I'm going to be safe when I'm in the car or driving with a person or a few people among that. I wouldn't feel safe at all, what so ever. Espcially if I was in that car with someone else who is driving, I would feel very uncomfortable, wouldn't you? I mean, seriously. The manufactuer of the car probably doesn't always do its job right, even though it said in the passage that a driverless car has never been in a crash or accident, you don't know what the future holds and anything could happen at any point in time. The car could stop working at anytime too, espcially if it was a plug in/charge car.

Quite frankly, I don't think I like this idea of a driverless car. It seems unsafe and risky, espcially if you have the wrong people in the car with you. If we all had no choice but to buy a driverless car, looks like I'm not buying one. I'll be walking or biking everywhere I go. Would you consider buying and using a driverless car for the rest of your life?
