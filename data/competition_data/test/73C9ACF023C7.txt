Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it is a very good thing for all kids our age to do community service. It helps out with pollution and helps keep our town clean.

Some kids like to do it but some kids don't. Most of us think it takes time away from fun activities we do over weekdays and weekends. I highly suggest that we make a sign-up board in the cafeteria for kids who want to work certain hours. I think Wednesday through Saturday is suitable. We can sign up and pick put 5 to 10 people we want to be in our groups. I think groups will help this problem.

I think most kids don't like it because there not working with their own very close friends. I honestly feel that way too. We all want to have fun and enjoy helping out.

Now as far as the helping out with Elementary kids goes, I think we can do the same thing. We can all come up with fun ideas for the kids and do it with them. On summer days we can do fun activities outside and have food and drinks. I think the School board wont mind if we use a tiny bit of money on pizza or chips. If they do I think we could chip in some money. When it is cold and winter we could do activities in the classrooms. We can have movies and hot chocolate. We can also bring board games for the kids.

I hope you really consider this letter. I feel it's a good way to help out,

Sincerely,
