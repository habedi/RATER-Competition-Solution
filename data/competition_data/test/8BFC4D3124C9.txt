The author of this passage thinks that Venus would be a worhty planet to investigate because it may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, in paragraph 4 it states "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life...", so what the author is tying to get at is that we could understand what happened to venus and would help us understand more on how we can alternate things to send over to venus to help us study it.

Some solutions that the author stated on what we could do to be able to live there so that we could study it better were that we could build a bimp like vehicle so that it would hover over the planet avoiding all of the dangers. But in doing so would still lead us to the questions how would we be able to get samples like rocks and things that they need to tudy it and he said that scientists today are coming up with solutions that would help us be able to get the thngs we need without having to get out or get harmed.

The author stated that Venus would be very important to study because tht would probably be the first planet that we could ever be able to visit and it would be best if we understood it more. And the fact that it used to be like earth could lead us to believe that this could happen to earth to, and this would help us to either prevent it from happening or to avoid it and maybe travel to another planet and avoid it.
