Community service is good for the community but i don't think its fair for all kids to do it. Kids should have choice if they want to do community service or do other activities. The people who do community service do it because they want to not because they have to. The people who don't do community service even if they had to they wouldn't put any real hard work into it they would just go threw the motions and try to wait until it is over which wouldn't help out at all.

kids who don't want to do community service will try anything to get out of it. They will probably ruin any fun for the people who do like to do community service with there negative attitudes. You also have to think how are you going to make them do community service if you tried to do it at school it would cut into class time and if it was after school how do you know that parents would make there kids do it. It could also cut into other activities such as sports or studying. It would just be a nuisance for the school and the kids. There really isn't a good reason to make kids do community service.
