Dear Mr. Senator:

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
