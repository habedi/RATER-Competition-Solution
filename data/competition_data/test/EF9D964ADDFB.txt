"The driverless cars are coming?" In this article they are talking about driverless cars well if you see it you wont belive it but google has made a car that is over half driveless. Google has the power and tencholy to make a driverless car when it comes to road work the driver has to take over in the car so its not all driverless. I think in the near time we should have driverless cars it would cause less accdientys at least you would think. Reading the passage the cars can only driver for a time peiod before a human has to take over on driving the car.

But i think we should have driverless cars who wouludnt want one all the old people could drive again younger people could drive and heck anyone could drive if we have self driving cars in the near time. In the passage they talked about a driving or assisting. "They say the car has antilock breaks and driver assistance stills seem a long way form the dream of calling a driverless cab." In the year 2000 they had no way of making this car possible but in the new years of this new age in are life they have the tencholgy to make a driving car that drives by itself.

Then they have one called waiting on the law? "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrains safe." Whats the number one law most people break anywhere its keeping them the people around them and anyone else safe. Most people dont want to have driveless cars it would be cool but all the trouble just to make one of these cars is a lot more work then it needs to be.

In the passage the last point they talk about would be sensing the world. In this point they have to make a senseo that can not only see what's around them but also in fornt, to the ,side above, and behind. So thats why google has made a 3-D modling type thing thats on top of the car and they can see all around them. If we try to see how much this would cost in a car your looking at maybe a million to just buy it then you have to add in the cost of using this device. Its taking the landscape around you and using 3-D molding to make the land around you.

In conclision i think there should be more google cars out there. But at the same time i don't think there should be more ways people can get hurt and the google cars, its been showing people have been hurt by a slef moving car. Googles car was ust one that had not hurt people yet. Myabe in the near future we will have driverless cars but for now i like driving my car around this town with out getting into an accdiently.
