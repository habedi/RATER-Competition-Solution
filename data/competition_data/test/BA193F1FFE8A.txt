The Seagoing Cowboys program started after World War Two ended in Europe. The program gives young cows, horses, and mules to the countries that got destroyed in the war. They put the young cows, horses, and mules on ships then sent them to different countries.

I had two different part-time jobs and when my friend told me about this opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I joined the Seagoing Cowboys on the day that the war in the Pacific ended.

My very first trip was to Greece. The ships had cows and horses on them. The Sea Cowboys had to feed them twice a day, clean out their stalls, and give them fresh water to drink. There was another job to be done on ths ship there was the night watchman. The night watchmen had to check in on the animals every hour then report it to the captain. This job can be very dangerous at times because one rainy night I went to tell the captain and slid down the ladder and almost went overboard into the dark, churning ocean. A small piece of metal saved my life. I was okay but I did have two broken ribs.

I Luke did the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy. I did sixteen across the Atlantic Ocean and two across the Pacific Ocean. I would want people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because when you are at the country that you are helping you get to visit many tourist attractions. When I was in Greece I got to see the Acropolis. The Acropolis is an ancient structure built in ancient times. I got to ride in a gondola in Venice, Italy. I toured an excavated castle in Crete. I also marveled at the Panama Canal on his way back from China.

On return trips after the animals were dropped off the men had fun. They had baseball and volleyball games in empty stalls, they also had table tennis tournements, along with boxing tournements. I also found time to have fun reading, whittling, and other fun games to pass the time at sea.

The Seagoing Cowboys would be a great way to help out others in need. I had a very amazing experience as a Seagoing Cowboy. I would want other young boys to have the same experience as I did when I joined the seagoing cowboys.

Luke says in the article, " I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of other people and countries' needs. Luke kept helping other people in need even after his adventure as a Seagoing Cowboy by leading his family to home a couple of international students and exchange families for many years. Luke had a great experience as a Seagoing Cowboy and he would want you to have the same experience as he did. Join the Seagoing Cowboys and help other people in need all around the world. Help the whole enire world by giving other people the things they need to survive. Luke did not notice how lucky he was until he joined the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke and others of those who served other people on the Seagoing Cowboys boats will have the right to say that they made a difference in this world. Luke would want you to make a difference.
