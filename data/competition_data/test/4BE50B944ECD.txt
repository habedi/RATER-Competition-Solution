Recently, a machine was created with the ability to calculate how a person is feeling based on facil structures. Scientists around the world are prasing this technology. I believe that even though this technology is impressive, it is completely unneccecery because of one major thing. The fundemental flaw of this system is the fact that it is a machine in the first place.

Machines are purely artifical beings that cannot feel nor comprehend human emotions on their own. As a result, their knowledge of emotions is only as good as their programmer's preception. In addition, the way this system detects emotions means that it can easily be cheated. A person could very easily fool the system into thinking they are happy by pulling a fake smile. Lastly, this system can only sense emotions based on appearences when about half of what determines how a person is feeling is based on their thoughts.

In conclusion, this system, while good, is completely broken because of how it functions. The only way a system like this could ever function effectively is if it could literally read minds. Emotions are complex things that cannot be decipered through simple algorythems. In the end, this system is only good for judgeing books by their covers.
