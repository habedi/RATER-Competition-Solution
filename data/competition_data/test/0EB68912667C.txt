Do you think that all student's should participate in at least one activity at school? Well here's my opinion, I personally agree with it because it gives students a chance to go out and do fun stuff instead of sitting in the house all day. I think the principal should add this because it could be something fun and new to try in your lifetime.

Here a couple of my reason's why our principal should do this. First, If a student really like's one certain sport but they've never been able to play before this would be good for them to go out there and actually do something that they really enjoy. Next, I think our principal should do this because it could be something new to some students and they could actually enjoy it. Then, If a student doesn't like the options that the principal listed then they could ask the principal to add something that they enjoy and if other students do to then they can also be apart of that. Finally, I think our principal should do this because it's a good way for students to go out and do fun things that they enjoy, instead of going home and just laying around doing nothing.

However, some students may not agree with this idea but I think that it's something fun and new to try in your lifetime. But like some people say always try something new even if you think your not gonna enjoy it you never know the possible outcome you might actually enjoy it. Therefore, there are my reason's on why I think our principal should do something like this for our school.
