I personally am not for driverless cars. I think that a person needs to operate a car not a computer. I think we need the brain of a person behind the wheel. When people hear driverless car they might think the car can do everything anot be be focused on the road for an emergency to happen.

There is alot of problems with technology now such as cell phones, computers,ect. There will be a big problem if something happens with the car and a wreck takes place who is a fault the technology or the person. All people need to be safe on the road or walking on the road so we need an alert persom behind the wheel.

People won't be focused on the road and if something is about to happen someone needs to be ready for an emergency so I think there will be alot of accidnets with the cars people will not be foucused like they are now not reliying on technology.

We rely on technology to much now. I think people will be bored behind the wheel and wait on their turn to drive. Technology is expensive to create and to buy. The cars will be over priced and won't sell that many. Not everyone will be offord one. So i think cost will be a problem with the cars to and taxes will be raised on the people to fun these cars and I don't think people will like that.

Driverless cars are not a good idea. They will not be safe because people will not be focused on the road anymore and that can be a problem for passegers or people on the side walks. Funding will be a problem I feel many people won't be able to buy them and with technology means people will lose there jobs and that's not a good thing.
