Did you know that 87 percent of students at Generic_School do an activity outside of school? Well, I'm one of those students doing an extracurricular activity. Forcing students to do an activity not only makes them disinterested because they are being forced to to it but also may make them uncomfortable around new peers they might not know. Students already have so much on their hands, why give them more to do.

Many students already do extracurricular activities outside of school. Making them do another extracurricular inside of school will make them have too much on their hands. I do swimming in a team outside of school every day. The practices are grueling, long and hard, sometimes even extending up to three hours. While I'm in the cold water that stings your skin every second you are standing still. In that moment you're just trying to put one hand in front of the other because you're tired from all the other sets. You might be asking whats going through my head at this moment? Well, I'm just trying to figure out the best possible way to do my homework effectively once I get home, so I still have some time to spend with my family. When I get out of swim I am exhausted by the amount practice we had to do, so all I want do do is go home and sleep. But, I remember that I still have homework to do and I have to eat a healthy dinner. By the time I go to sleep it's really late because I stressed to much over homework. With swim taking up a majority of my afternoon I will not be able to do other extracurricular activities.

Having to stay after school can create complications among parents. Some parents will not always be able to pick up their child. Not all kids have a mode of transportation home actually many don't. In this area people may be wealthy and have cars, but still not all people use cars some use buses. For example, our school does not have running after school buses every day, just Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays so on other days parents will have to pick them up which is not quite convenient. Many parents work till 6:00 pm to support their families, so therefor ariving home around 6:30. Students staying till almost 7:00 pm will probably not make them very happy because they have to stay an extra four hours at school. Another, complication with might occur is that many clubs you have to pay for some small things here and there not all parents might be able to support the extra cost that might come in. Which parent is going to pick up their child can also impact how much time they get to spend with their family.

Kids want to build relationships with everyone their family. Kids like having relationships with their parents and brothers/sisters. Studies have shown from Stanford University that kids who built relationships with their parents at an early age are more likely to ask them for advice. This can lead to more trust between kids and parents as they grow up. This is not only good because they have a trusted adult to talk to, but also because later in life when they need to open up about something that was not a good decision they are more likely to do it. I open up to my brother more than my parents because he understands me more. This is mostly because he's up with the current generation unlike my parents which don't exactly understand today's music and dating life. He often helps me solve my problems which is nice because usually I don't have someone to talk to. Relationships with anyone in your life always need to be put first because they can't even compete with how much less important extracurricular's are.

Extracurricular activities are important but adding them in school doesn't help, many students already do an activity outside of school. Enforcement on a certain activity not only makes students want to do it less, but also less effort is put into schoolwork and other actives. Kids often love spending time with their friends and family whether it is inside or outside it doesn't matter to many because all they want to do is spend time with their family. Overall, making students participate in a school activity doesn't benefit the community.
