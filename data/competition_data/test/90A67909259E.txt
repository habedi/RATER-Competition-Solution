Early in the morning, in a class room flooding with students. The announcements start and the principles voice seeps into the ear's of the children mentioning that he will make every student to attend in a extracurricular activity. For example band, art, sports, and many more.

I personally agree with the principle over making every student in our school go to an elective, because the activities in the electives are fun. When I play in band I'm always having a good time ether playing my instrument or talking to my peers. You can also have an entertaining time by playing sports like soccer or foot ball which are always fun to play. Otherwise you can also be in the school council and help students with their problems which could put a grin on your face after you receive a warm "thank you" from the students you helped. when it comes to electives fun isn't everything but it is a large part of the experience.

Electives also help in our teamwork and friendship skills. when you first go to your electives room you might some people but there will probably be some one in that room that you don't know. So that would be the best time for you to make a new friend. When your in band your music is supposed to sound like it was coming from one big instrument which sound together and complete. To do this you need team work, when you play your instrument while listening to the people around you so that you can sound like a band. Maby your interested in a sport, but without team work the team wont work. While in these extracurricular activities you should focus on both team work and friendship while also focusing in what your being taught or told to do.

When the principle told us to pick a elective because we had to do at do least one, he was basically asking us to pick another class. So we are still going to learn new things from the teachers that we are given. For example if I was going to art class I would learn how to make art and the history of art. If your in band like me well your going to learn how to read the notes on the music sheets. In other words, everything in the extracurricular activities are educational and very helpful to you in the future. Like how you can get a full scholarship for playing sports or band.

In conclusion I agree with the principle in making every student in campus participate an extracurricular activity. These activities are fun, friend ship and team work builders, and educational for all students. In my opinion I think these activities will make students have something to look forward to after school.
