so i guess this paragraph is going to be about technology and stuff which is cool after all i do plan to be the greatest actor in the world someday so im pretty much have to know about technology eventually. however as of right now its kind of irrelevant well lets not say that i'll say more in the lines or confusing if so to speak like first of all its a painting who cares how she was feeling you know. i got of topic basically the real question is is the technology used to recognize emotions valuable or not. luckly for you guys i have an opinion which may or may not be ignorant or not but as for your question ill answer it in about 3 paragraphs. but for now before i begin i will say it will certainly change our world as we know it for the better let me tell you why.

now according to the paragraph the machine is supposed to use a 3d computer to model all 44 facial muscles which is called a action unit by using the 6 classified main emotions. which are happiness'fear'surprise'anger'discust'fear'and sadness all of which we all humans feel on a regular basis. i know it seems kind of weird but you know it could actually be useful in the near future like we may be able to use it for interrogation for criminals. the other thing we could do with it is if we evolve as a race we could upgrade our tchnology and be able to detect moods instead of emotions mind blown right i think the future will be pretty cool. the future will be cool because if we were to actually pull that off we could understand each other better this paragraph is about how the facial action coding system can help us in the future. i think it is valuable for crime uses science stuff basically for all proffesions you could even use it for day to day life or for rehab or something i definitely think they should make a mood changer to enhance it.

but as for the emotions i think its just neat and a cool thing to do like in my opinion unless you upgrade it to a mood sensor it's kind of useless and boring and basicaly not valuable. but dont listen to me this is coming from a f foot 10 16 year old so by all means dont let me discourage you i say if you want to do it go for it. i really dont see the use tin class to be honest its more like a toy than a machine i guss its cool for museums to see paintings but thats just my opinion.
