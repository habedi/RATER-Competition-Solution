Dear Principal,

A rumor is going around that you are making a new rule about the sports program. The rule, so rumor tells, that you are not going to allow kids to participate in sports unless they maintain a B average. Pardon me, but how do you manage that when most students only hold a C average. If you ask me, and maybe a few others, this is an obscure idea. Myself holds a C average and a few of my friends maintain a C average when they are the best players on the team. I do see the possible positives coming from this idea. Like that the students wanting to participate in a sporting team then must acquire good grades, not just good physical doings. Yet this is idea is still not agreeable in my head, I say we keep the sports grade averages at their normal of a C average-low D average stand.

Sincerely,
