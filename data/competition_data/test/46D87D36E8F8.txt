With the majority of people owning and using a cell phone daily, often times these people use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. This act can put not only the driver but other people's safety at risk. Humans should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Using a cell phone while operating a vehicle can cause a person to be distracted and their focus to be shifted from the road to their device. If a vehicle is driving at sixty miles per hour, a second of distracting phone usage can cause the driver to miss hundreds of feet ahead of them leaving them vulnerable to any possible accidents in front of them. This is a danger to not only the driver but to any other drivers on the road and can lead to unnecessary injuries. Banning any phone usage while driving will greatly decrease the amount of injuries and deaths due to automobile accidents.

There are already many efforts from both phone and car manufacturers to try and help the problem of phone usage while driving. Phone companies have started to implement different apps that can turn phone notifications off while a person is driving. Such as Apple with Do Not Disturb While Driving that tracks when you are driving and blocks all calls, texts and other notifications. Car manufacturers also do not let drivers pair their phone to the car bluetooth while the car is driving. Both phone and car manufacturers have recognized that it is dangerous when people operate both in conjunction and are trying to save lives.
