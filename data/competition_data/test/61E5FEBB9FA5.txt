I have never liked Government intervention on desicions that should be left up to the people who feel the effect of mandate. However, Government intervention on limiting the amount of car usage may prove to be a genuinely good cause. It may prove to accomplish what Government was first formed to do; help shape the world to make it a better place to co-exist, not only with each other, but with the whole Earth.

At fist, it may seem a little crazy in our day and age to actually reverse the climb of our use of technology and innovation, like vehicles. After all, isn't that what we're supposed to do? Isn't it natural to constantly evolve as time passes? Well, cars aren't natural, and they destroy what is.

We are facing dangerous pollution; "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" (Source 2, 10). This is alarming to me and many people who care for the Earth. Every day, we're facing new headlines of negativity, and although whether Kim Kardashian's dress fits or not is upsetting, I think we need to focus on more important things and expell the negativity we're always bashed with. We could be developing things that will really make an impact, like new breakthrough sciences on space, medical sciences, and so much more. Instead, "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change" (Source 1, 7).

But, there is hope in all this. Already, we're seeing improvements. "The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company" (Source 4, 32). Maybe reversing the climb of our use of cars isn't so hard after all; we can hit the ground running.

A reduction in the ownership of cars has also shown a surprising improvement of psychological well-being. In Vauban, Germany, they have almost completely cut out automobile use in their community. "'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor" (Source 1, 3). It sounds like people can be much happier without the constant buzz of cars coming and going. The mention of children also makes me think that it would be a much safer environment to raise children without the stress of parents having to worry if their children would be safe with so many cars about. I think everyone remembers their parents telling them time and time again to look both ways before crossing, and then double check, and then hold their hand, and watch out for right-turning traffic. A reduction in automobile use, in this case, is directly related to the stress parents have over their children when doing something so simple as crossing the street.

In addition, a reduction in automobile use and ownership gives the local Government something more beneficial to focus on, rather than spending millions on re-paving roads; "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up" (Source 3, 28). With this change, local Government can focus on really improving the standard of living; more job openings with more buisinesses, easier travel (despite what one might think) during rush-hour, and a higher level of general safety with less danger of car accidents.

All in all, I think it will be a hard transition to go through if Government does plan to get involved in the reduction of car usage. It's easy to make bad habits, but it's hard to break them. However, if we do succeed, we will see a huge improvement on the environment and the standard of living, and it will be really worth it. These are not views or opinions; these are facts.
