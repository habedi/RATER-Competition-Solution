Today I am going to tell you why you should go to Seagoing Cowboys program.

Seagoing Cowboys program is a program where you go out on a big boat and you go on the seas and travel to different crountries.

I am first going to tell you why you should go. You should go to the program because you get to see all different kind of countries like Greece, China, and Europe. Why would you not want to go to different countries. Other people might say it's way to dangerous because you might run out of food or the boat might sink and you might get lost while you are out in the seas. You will not run out of food because the person who is encharge packs 6 months of food. If the boat does sink, there will be another boat behind us. You will not get lost because there will be other people there with you and there will be maps.

When you get to a country like Venice,Italy there will be a city with streets of water so we can stay in the boat. What you can see at the different countries is where people live, what kind of houses does the people live in, and you will be aloud to take pictures so you will never forget your time at the countries and the boat.

So that is why you should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will have alot fun while you will be on the trip. So make sure you pack alot of clothes and pack your bag for a avdevture.
