I agree with the principal that students must have a B average if they want to play a sport. They should have a B average because if students get like a C and there in a sport they wouldn't bother to do there homework.

They would mostly be focus on the sport there in then focusing on there own learning at school. It would be better do have students wit B average for then they could know if they get a C or something they wouldn't be able to be in the sport that they want to be in.

If the students don't have a B average i think that's good that they wouldn't get to play a sport because then if they know they cant play a sport then they would know that they need to bring up there grades for they could play the sport that they want to play. Also that the principal should just tell them if you want to be in a sport you need to bring up your grades or else you cant play the sport that you want to play in. If the students decide to not bring there grades up then that's there choice.

The principal should like convince the students to get there grades up for they could play the sport that they want to play. I know that some students would bring there grades up because they do want to play the sport that they want to play. Its good that the principal wants to change the school policy.

So yes i agree with the principal that he should change the school policy for the students could know that they need to get there grades up. The students should listen to the school policy rule if they change it. The policy would help the students because the students would have good grades and they would like the sport that there in. the principal should change it and
