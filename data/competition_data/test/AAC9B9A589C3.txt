In the artical, "The Challenge of Exploring Venus"

the author feels that Venus is a "worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents", meaning no matter how dangerous Venus really is, he/she thinks it would still be a good idea to explore or even just get a better understanding of Venus.

The author goes into detail on how Venus is one of the closest plants to us, and is even the most earth like plant. They say Venus has vallys, mountins, craters, and even might have had water many years ago. They say how we haven't touch or landed on Venus in a few decades because the atmospher is so dangerous, and he/she wants us to try to be able to have life there on Venus.

The author says that venus is often refered to as earths twin, all because of the fetures it has, he/she then goes on to say that each and every previous misson was unmanned, and for a good reason, because no spacecraft survives a landing on mars for even a few hours. He/she says that Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97% carbon, that just covers venus like a blanket, and that the temperature average on venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit with a atmospheric pressur about 90 times greater that on earth. those conditions are much more extreame, and would take much more advanced technology.

So the author says that he/she thinks that exploring venus and being able to have life on venus again would be great, if we can get the technology that is required to be able to get up there and actually be able to land for more then a few hours. He/she also thinks that it would be great to be able to have life on Venus or have that as a back up eath. They go on to give us many deatils on how Venus is unsafe for our technology at the moment, and how hard it would be to get there and stay for a long time, but they also go to say a good start would be being able to just get samples of the gas or the rocks on Venus and jsut move on from that point on.
