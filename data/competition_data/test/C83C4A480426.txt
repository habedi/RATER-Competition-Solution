Have you ever went on a camp out in the woods? Have you ever went camping out on water but for about 2 months? Now you can there is a progm that helps animals go to a different country. There are animals that need fed and you can do every night or even be a look out for whats coming ahead. The trip is fun but dangerous. You have to go on a boat that moves back and fourth. The fun part is that you can stay up all night and you get to never wake up unless its your job to feed the animals.

Luke's claims are having fun and being with his best friend. Luke also knew it would be a lif time opportunity. Luke was watching out for ahead and checking on the animals then he went to tell captin that when the ladder was wet and slippery. Luke fell and his heart pounding like a hammer. Luke was almost dead but he wasn't he broke a couple of ribs but hes fine he and work for a couple of days.

I dont know if i would join sounds fun too. Joining the prograhm was to help for world war ll also. The war was tough because there was a lot of stuff ruined by it too world war ll was a desaster but we thank the people that were in it. If you do join the progrhm they call you "A Seagoing Cowboy". Luke and his friend were happy that they were still alive.
