I think that the ability for computer to be able to read and calculate human emotions is a step towords the future and is a good thing. I beleve this will help us as humans in unlocking coads in old paintings to better understand them. I also beleve that this new tecnology will help prevent suicide.

For example in the atricle it talks about how they can unlock the Mona Lisa's smile and calculat her emotions. This is one way that the new tecnology will help us better undersand just who the Mona Lisa was. for years the Mona lisa has remaned a mistery to all of mand kind along with many other paintings. This is why I beleve that this new since of tecnology will expand our mind as far as history,knologe and also it will help us better understand ourselfs as humans and why we think and feel the way we do. This new form of tecnology I beleve is the step towerds a new begining.
