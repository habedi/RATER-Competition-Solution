there are many reasons why you should not change the policy to sports. some of those reason are that kids need to be motivated with sports some times that is all a kid has is his or her life.

see if the kids knows they have something worth studying for then they will. but kids can only get there grades so high most of the kids are getting c' s because they want to keep playing sports and they know that's how much there average has to be to keep playing their not going to do any higher or any lower there going to get C' s in all there classes because they either feel like all they can get is c' s or there just to lazy but if you change the policy its more likely that kids aren't going to do any better they might just do worse because of the stress and anger. that you changed the policy to high. well what can i say i am a person of sports my self and i love them but i know how hard it is to get an B or an A and even thou its inst imposable and kids can do it they wont why ? i don't have the answer to that but i can say that kids are just stubborn. well some of them but as a kid i do know that if the policy was to change for cheer leading i would be upset i would try but i would still be vary upset
