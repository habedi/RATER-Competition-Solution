Dear principal,

I have heard that you are may start to not allow the student body not able to participate in activities such as sports, and or after school activities unless they have at least a B average. It is to say that most of the student body have at least a C. I disagree with this new rule for three reasons. The first reason is that some of the students in this school learn slower than others and may not get their work finished in time, this also is to say that it is not because they don't want to do the work but because they may be overly excessive with the quality with their work.

The second reason is that in some of the after school activities can help with the lack of work being done of the timing in the way that in some of the activities that this school has ,like sports, use math and reading which in the long-run will make the students grades superior .

The final reason is that some of the students may have disability's which may make their comprehension of what is being taught confusing and hard to know how to do that project. Most schools in North Carolina go by if the average is at least a C. i hope that you think about whatI have said about this topic which would impact the students in a big way , I also hope that you decide not to enforce this new rule .

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
