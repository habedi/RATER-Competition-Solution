In 2020 Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are believed to be coming out with driverless cars? This is going to change the world. There have been many driverless cars, but people do not hear about them that often. I think that more people should hear about them people because driverless cars are the future.

If Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan come out with driverless car, i'm going to have to get one. I'm not sure if you have your hands on the steering wheel, but if you don't. You can do whatever you want. There's alot of people hating on driverless cars because they think its dangerous. People probably thought cars were dangerous back when cars were new. This could save people not kill people. There's alot of drunk people who die in a regular car and if they were in a driverless car they probably would have been safe. People are always afraid of change.

People need to spread news about driverless cars because they are going all over the world.
