Some schools require sudents to complete summer projects to assure that they continued learning during their break. In order for the school to know weather their students learned over their break, their summer projects must be teacher designed.

When it comes to projects that are required by the school, the projects should have high standards; which means they should be teacher-designed. Teachers put a lot of thought into their students assignments, they think about things that the student may learn in the process of doing their work. They are the ones who teach and push students to their limit so that they can benefit from it in the long run. If the projects were to be student-designed, the students will not put the same amount of effort in their work. They will not put the same amount of thought, instead they will take the easy way out which does not benefit the student intelectually. Now the easy way out for a student would be making the projects topic on something they already know by heart. This would lead the school into thinking that their student's learned something new during the summer.

In order for a student to learn over their break, they will need something a bit challenging. Something that will exercise their mind and lead them into puting more thought into their project. Usually when teachers assign projects, they give their students a rubric explaining what they expect from their work. Rubrics have standards, it gives students an idea of how their project may be great or awful. Some students may look at it and think about how they want it to be a succesful project, others will look and think about how they can improve their work. By teachers using this method they can see who really worked hard on their projects. Another way of knowing if the student's have learned would be by teachers assigning every student an individual topic. None of the students would be able to copy off of eachother for answers, they would have to find their own information.

Another way that the school would be able to assure that their students learned over break would be by a report made by a teacher. Teachers can now use certain apps to see if their students have logged in and completed a certain part of the summer project. Some teachers may assign students relieable website's recommended by the county or state in order for students to use over the summer so that they can exercise their minds. When using the site's the students would have to use specific log in account's that would connect to the teachers account. That would let the teacher see if they have been using it and if they are struggling in certian subjects in the class. Plus all the data would be recorded and could easily be sent to the school so that they can see in better depth of what their students are learning. This would be a great way to make sure that the students are learning over their break.

The only way for the school to know if the students are learning and completing their summer projects would have to be with teacher-designed projects. Teachers truley care about their students and want them to do the best that they can. Whenever students get the liberty of doing something on their own, they often cheat or end up doing anything and calling it work. But with putting standards in, it changes the entire way the student thinks and how they process everything because of the requirments they must meet. By pushing students that extra mile the school will be able to tell if they have learned once break is over and they will see improvements in their work by the time they come back from break.
