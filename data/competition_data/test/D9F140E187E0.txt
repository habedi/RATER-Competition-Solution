I would agree with the principals opinion because. it would help you make new friends. Also it would get kids more exersuize. it would help the work effort of the school and the yearbook profession. It helps make the school look better in ways like a debate team and a sports team.

Way's the work effort would go up is. kids would want to Singh up for the clubs. The year book progression would be done in no time and out for sale. makes kids want to join a debate team and a sports club. The clubs would make kids more active in the community and in school.

Way's it make more friends is. If you take debate team you could meet new people that you have never meet. Could meet new people in other schools. Could get you to know your teacher more. The people from other schools could be form another school for sports.

Gets betterÂ exersuize. the sports club could do practice and do games agenst other schools. start a JRROTC club for the students who want to go the the military. Start a running team like a cross country team. Do a gym club for working out at the gym. Start a club for walking like for a mile a day.

I would go with the principals opinion on this because. it would help you make new friends. Also it would get kids more exersuize. it would help the work effort of the school and the yearbook profession. It helps make the school look better in ways like a debate team and a sports team.
