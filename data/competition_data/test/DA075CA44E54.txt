In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.
