"So you really think that was created by aliens?" says I to the man who thinks aliens created the "Unmasking Face". "Yes i really believe aliens made that". "How would an alien have made that ? ALIENS AREN'T REAL" I shout. I think to myself , this man is nuts how would a freaking alien make that if they never existed? Maybe he's just playing he doesn't really think that he just thinks its funny to play. "U HAVE NO PROOF ALIENS AREN'T REAL , IN FACT THE PROOF THAT THEY WE'RE ONCE ALIVE IS THE UNMASKING FACE DUUUUH" said the guy. "YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PROOF BUT YOU HAVE NO PROOF THAT THE ALIENS MADE THAT , How about this neither one of us are correct until we get proven facts , Okay? Okay" I said to the man trying to stop arguing with him. "Nooo Nooo aliens were as real as ever they made this" he said ,"Actually i believe a natural landform created it , maybe time after time it starts to look more and more like a face but in reality it's just something that natural landform created , not aliens man." I said to the man who thought he knew it all . The man still seemed to want to argue with me "Now now now , you got a good point but nothing can make me believe that aliens didn't do this , I just CAN'T AND WON'T BELIEVE IT , my grandfather told me aliens created it as I was a kid so I believe that's how it was made."I no longer wanted to argue with the man so I said "Okay believe what you want" and that was the end of the discussion.
