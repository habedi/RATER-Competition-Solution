This story talks about your facial emotions like Dr. Huang observed. He observed that the artisit such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enought to convey specific emotions. It helps them because if you're feeling sad you might go to the art muesum and see a picture that has a happy family and they can put a smile on your face. Another thing is that there is a muscle called Orbicularis Oculi Parrs Palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes if you didn't know about that. But also, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce. Also, in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle called The Risorius. But to an expert, faces don't lie, these muscles clues are somtimes used tto spot a "smiling" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful. For example if you're feeling sad and your friend tells a funny joke you can fake a smile your friends won't even relize your faking a smile. Also a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, he had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowing (what a great way to practice) as a way of creating these emotions on stage and i think that's a really great way to practice because if they go up on stage and don't know how to do a really great emotion their drama teacher might get angry. In conclusion i think have a drama teacher teaching you how to do an emotion right and having computers to tell if your happy or sad or angry is a good thing to have in the world.
