Using the FACS in classrooms to read students emotional expressions is valuable. The Face action Coding System is a new creative piece of technology that can be very fun to use. It is painless and will only read or examine your facial expressions.

We humans do this all the time without even meaning to, we can look at a friend and tell whether they are having a bad day or not. If we can do it, wouldn't it be neat to see if the FACS can do it also? Technology is so smart in todays world, that the Face Action Coding System would be able to tell if you are making a fake expression or a real one. If classrooms were to invest in this system students would not be forced to use it, it is optional.

I think that it would be amazing to have this system in a classroom. Our computers here at home can't do the or handle the complex algorithms that were used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. I never would have thought that there was so much science and technology that was used to reveal or examine a smile or facial expression(s).
