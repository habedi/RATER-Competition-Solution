Dear Mrs.*******,

I honestly think that isn't fair because the students who contain a C average might not have a good chance to get a higher grade for instance, if a child has an abusive step parent and get bullied at school do you honestly think that child can focus on their school work. No, he can't, he's to afraid he might get his butt kicked if the teachers leaves to use the restroom. That's one example look at this one, what if the child is mentally disturbed and suffers from ADHD That child might also be very good at sports because of his hyper-ness. That child might have a chance to become a millionaire, but if you pass this new policy you could hurt that child's chances. This is another good example, I'm sure as a principle you should know that some students are better at sports than others, and some are better at "books" then others. A child might be phenomenal at sports but maintain a D average. Like i stated earlier he could have abuse issues, focusing issues, hormone issues, or even sexual issues that stop him from thinking straight.

In conclusion if this policy is passed you as a principle would have to deal with a lot of complaints mad by parents and students. You might also end up stopping someone from achieving a life long goal and have stress knowing that you caused this.
