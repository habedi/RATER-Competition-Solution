TEACHER_NAME,

Not all students can maintain a B average. If you change the school policy. You will probably have less Extra Curricular activities and less students wanting to come to Everglades High. The football team will probably have to quit knowing that you will not accept any other grades. Plus, not all teacher faculty curves grades. I'm not even able to keep up a B average all the time. Most parents cannot pay money for a tutor. Tutoring isn't cheap. So, you might want to think twice before you change the policy. It would also mean less sports agents coming to the school. Even if they are here to see students that are keeping up the average.

Most children come to your school because of the sports and other multiple activities in your school. If you take it away nobody would be coming here cause they want to. But, because there forced to. Kids need freedom and most of theirs are the schools activities. Taking that away would be like taking away their future, passion, and hope. It helps them keep believing in things. Even if that thing is maintaining a C average. Think twice before you get laid off. It's probably not everyday that someone is trying to tell you how and when to do the right thing or job. But, I am telling you now, and like it is. Minors will be miserable knowing that they get kicked off a team for a C. Then everybody would give up hope on you too.

TEACHER_NAME, Don't change the policy because you think it's right. You should be thinking about who's life your going to mess up. If you make the policy to the point were everybody needs a B. Nobody is going to have a passion anymore. Weather it's art, football, cheer leading, or Chess club. It's what their life reflects on.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
