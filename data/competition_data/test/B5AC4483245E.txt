Timmy thinks the faces on Mars were created by aliens,but i keep telling him its just natural landforms that we made and it looks like faces. It happens even on Earth, it is common around the American west. In the viking photo they didn't have that well equitment to see what it actually was, so they thought it was created by aleins. In 2001, NASA wanter to show the world and the captioned a note by it saying "huge rock formation," but people just saw a face because of the shadows in it. The authors reasoned it to be a good idea to engage people and give attention to Mars.

The "Faces on Mars" started to become popular, they started to make movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. In April 1998 they flew over it again, they had better technology,and they didn't see a face all they saw was a natural landform. Then in 2001 they did it again and didn't see anything just the landform and they had much better technology where you could see a small shack and nothing was there.

These Faces were just landforms that had a shadow that made it look like a face.

Every plantet has weird landforms, and they didn't really have good techlology back then. Now they have alot better technology were they can drive robots on mars and see all these weird landforms and see if there is aliens.
