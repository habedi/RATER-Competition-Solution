Have you ever wanted to be a seagoing cowboy. Well if you have I am going to explain what a seagoing cowboy does and som reasons you should not be an seagoing cowboy.

I think that you should sign up for the seagoing cowboys program because you can see things you never seen before. One place you might be able to see being a seagoing cowboy is China. Second if you really like animales like cows,horeses,or mules you should sign up. Last if you like traveling over sea or never been over seas it will be an awsome experince.

Now I am going to gives some reasons you should not sign up for the seagoing cowboys program. One reason you should not sign up for the seagoing cowboy program is that if you are sea sick and don't like boats you should not be on one for a long distance. Second if you don't like some animales and you think that you can't be on a boat for long distances with them you should not sign up for this program. Last if you are scared of the water or scared of going over bord then you should not be on a boat.

In conclusion you should sign up for the seagoing program only if you like any thing in the first paragraph,but if you don't then you probrobly arn't cut out for the job. But you can always help people,animales,and our environment. Right there in your home town.
