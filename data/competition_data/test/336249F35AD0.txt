Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that the school policy should not be changed.

It lowers the amount of players or students in each sport or activity, it ruins some of the students' dreams to become famous sports players, artists, or chess players, and is unfair.

Students should be able to join sports or other activities with at least a C average.

Most of the students have C averages so will not be able to participate in what they wish to do.

They should have a chance to join what they want to join.

Increasing the grade point average to a B average will effect the amount of students in each sport or activity.

The groups will lower because most of the students have a C average.

Also it will affect how many schools that our school will play against because we have smaller teams.

In addition it could affect the schools reputation because not many.

Other schools will know that the policy has been increased, and since there are less students the other schools and adults will think we do not give good education.

Not only is changing the policy going to affect the amount of students joining the sports or activities it will also affect the students dreams.

There are many students who want to become or may become the most famous sports player or artist in the country or maybe even the world.

Changing the policy will affect how students think about these things because they think that they are smart enough to join a sport or activity and it is not worth it anymore.

Each student who has a C average now will have their dream crushed.

In addition it is unfair to students who have a grade point average lower than a B.

Their dreams will be crushed forever.

Students will think that sports or other activities are not worth it anymore, and will give up.

Not all kids in our school have over

Your Student,
