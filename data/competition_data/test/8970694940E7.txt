Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe you are requiring kids to have a B average to play sports in school, and i believe that most students have C averages. I must have to say that I disagree because i believe C grades are in the 70 averages and its still passing and good enough. If it was 65 or lower the grade needs improvement and those people who have 65 and lower should not play because it might cause distraction to themselves and work. A, B, and C averages deserve to play because those grades look good on your report card.

An A average is excellent. A B average is great. A C average is good. Anything under 65 needs improvement. That's how i believe its suppose to work in able to play sports on actual teams. I also think that if you are in the 60's, in order to play on a team you have to have great behavior and at least try to pass because maybe you are trying hard enough but you just can't get to the point of A, B, and C averages.

It's not fair just for people to have a B average because other people deserve to play and there have to be a limit. I've seen people note get to play and they need to express themselves and if you play good in high school college scouts would see and would like to give you scholarships. I hope you understand my opinion and make a better choice. I rest my case.
