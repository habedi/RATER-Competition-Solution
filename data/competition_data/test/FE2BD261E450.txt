PHONES & DRIVING

I have heard so many stories and lectures about being on your electronic devices while driving. Using electronic devices while driving your vehicle is not great at all. Cell phones are just a distraction that tends to keep your mind off the road and focused on the phone. Distractions while driving can lead to injuries and/or death. I remember when my father first bought me a cell phone; I could not keep my eyes or hands off of it. It became a total distraction for me. Three Main Reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving is because, such behavior can cause casualties, inflict pain upon families, and leave the driver with guilt.

First, causing and/or having casualties in families are not great. Having death causes pain, sorrow, and many burdens that people have on their shoulders to deal with. Hearing about another family member in your family being passed away, is not a good feeling. Almost 1.3 million people die due to being on their electronic devices while driving their vehicle. An electronic device is really not necessary while driving. In addition, using cell phones while driving is unsafe; therefore let's try to prevent many casualties as we can.

Another reason why citizen's use should not use cell phones while driving is because; the person driving the vehicle may inflict pain on their families. With that being said, the family members of the deceased family will be hurt, because death leaves a void. Likewise, the family member of the driver who caused the accident will be hurt as well, because they would not want their loved one incarcerated. Although nothing replaces a life; however, violators should be disciplined for their actions.

Finally, a person using cell phones while driving can end up having to live with guilt upon them. What can they do? What can do they say? The words "I am sorry", does not change a bad occurrence. It can be really difficult living with guilt. For example, I have a friend who killed a dog and after the incident happen she felt astonished by what she had done. Her family was hurt by what she had done to another family's pet, and the dog's family was upset because it was their guard dog and home protector. After all of the commotion was over, she had said she really felt bad about the situation. When you do something wrong, you cannot always apologize for your wrong doings. When you try to talk to their families, they will not always listen. The result for you is dealing with guilt for the rest of your life.

In conclusion, using cellular devices while driving has become more of a negative influence. More and more people having started using their phones while driving. Although these kinds of actions can cause casualties, influential pain, and having to live with guilt, the citizen willing to not use their cellular device while driving, can prevent all of this from having.
