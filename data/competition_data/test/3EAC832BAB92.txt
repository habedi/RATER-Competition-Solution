hello, principal

I'm STUDENT_NAME

I really think that student should be able to bring their cell phones to school during lunch time. When class start i think the cell phones need to be in the locker or if they don't have a locker they can turn them off while in class.

Because after school some kids walk home by their self and need a cell phone to call someone to watch them or pick them up. Cause a lot is happening these days its not safe like it use to be. I think long as they keep their phone off it will be ok. Or either they put them on vibration it will be cool or give it to a teacher so they can pay more attention.

Or they can keep them on but make sure they really low cause ring tones can mess up your mind while you or make you forget what you was going to put down for a answer for a problem. Then if a student don't do what is told they get their cell phone took and a call home. I really think that going work instead of a student trying to be on their phone during lunch or even class. Some students don't feel right without their phone cause they got to walk home or a rapist stay down by the school or down the rode from them. I have a cell phone cause a rapist stay down the rode from me and he be everywhere in you don't see him sometimes. So some parents want their kids with a cell phone cause they don't see the worst. What would you do if your child stayed the rode from a rapist??
