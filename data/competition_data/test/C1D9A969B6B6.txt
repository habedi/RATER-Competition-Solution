What do you do with your time? This year our principal has decided that we all have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. When making this decision the principal didn't hesitate to present her students with a amount of activities they can participate in. So many options include things like participation in any sport, effort on the yearbook, and even just serving on the student council. Deciding that all students have to participate in a extracurricular activity can spark a new interest and can turn into a good tool for improving time management.

A range of interests are found out each day, each sparking in different type of people. Sports, reading, crafts are some of many interests students like to participate in. Many students try to find what their good and what they enjoy. Some don't, a good amount of students don't exactly know what there going to do in the future, many haven't given it a thought. This new rule can spark many new interests to people who expect it the least. You never know if you like it or not if you haven't tried it. This a way many students can find things they would of never tried and advance on doing it all while they enjoy themselves. New hobbies are made and student makes the expectation of the new rule.

Some you are know stranger to procrastination. Procrastination is a form of holding off important things to the very last minute. Phones. Phones have been a big staple in people's efforts and time. Nine out of ten teens have some social media installed on their devices. This whole generation revolves around our prized possession, our phones. When scrolling, tapping, or even watching funny videos time flies. As I was saying earlier this new rule may cause some new interests to spark up. A student may find a interest they want to continue. Now the student can balance their time with an equal portion on every part of their day. A balanced day, if you will.

At the start if this essay I explained how students could benefit from this rule. Overtime a student many not only find his or her interests but improve a use of their time management skills. Your body needs to get a certain amount of vitamins and foods to function. The same way a student could process better information and do even better in school when their mind ins't always thinking about one certain thing. Broading the minds idea of things could help with time management and the future glide of what the later do in life.
