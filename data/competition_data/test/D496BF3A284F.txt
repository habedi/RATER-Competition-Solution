One day you principal decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, this can range from sports to running for student council. This may sound great at first but once you analyze the situation and realize this may not be ideal for all families, you will see why this idea should be expelled right away.

To begin, the main question we should be asking is why, why are these students being told they have to participate in these activities?

Not only should we be asking why, we should be asking;

What would happen if they don't?

From family matters, money issues, transportation, to school work,, there are many reasons a student may not be able to participate in these activities.

To further explain my reasoning, all people have families, and with these families comes matters and other issues that need to be dealt with. For example, if a family member in this students' life happens to pass away, is the school going to tell this child to get over it and come do their activity? Or say these parents dont pay for some sort of child care system and they give this responsibility to the eldest child, are the schools going to punish these children because have to take care of their younger sibling? From slight examination, this doesn't look to good for the schools.

If the schools are going implement this mandatory rule, how will they make it so all kids can participate? This leads to my next statement,

Will the schools provide transportation to the students who may need it?

Speaking on personal experience it can be difficult for students to get a ride home after activities when their only source of transportation is their guardians who may be unable to pick them up for reasons such as working, inability to drive, and many reasons which would make it near impossible for the child to get home. Also it can be quite embarrassing to ask for a ride home everyday. This can also lead to another major problem, kidnapping, the schools may be unaware as to whom the child is going home with and that can lead to a serious problem and a possible lawsuit on the schools hands. Furthermore, if the school are serious about this plan then they will be responsible for making sure every child is safe and has a stable way of getting home.

To continue on the topic of schools providing, lets talk about financial issues for the students and the schools as well. Not only will the schools have to give up an exponential amount of money to provide resources fro these activities, the students will too. More often than not, the guardians of these students have to give up a good amount of money in order to participate in this activities, and often times the schools forget that not everyone has the same amount of financial stability. This can lead to the student feeling left out when their classmates have stuff they nay not be able to afford, or in other instances, bullying. In order for each student to feel included the schools will have to pay for all of the resources.

All of the previous points may sound bad, but this upcoming one should persuade you on its own. From family matters to financial issues nothing really compares to what could be happening to these young people if they are forced to do these activities. While these activities may be fun, each child has to eventually go home to complete any school work. With this gargantuan load of waking up early in the morning, attending school for eight hours each day, going to their activity, and then going home to do more school work can induce an amount of stress no one under the age of 20 should ever endure. While reading this you may be wondering about the students who voluntarily do these activities, they choose to participate in this and they can better plan out their schedule and balance their work. However if this idea is put into action these students won't have much of a choice.

When you are given a good chunk of the facts, do you really want your child to have to worry about being kidnapped, being excluded by their classmates, or endure an unnessasary amount of stress at a very young age? Do you want your child to be unable to focus in class because of the large work load that's being dumped on them? If not, it is your responsibility to tell your school districts that you don't think this is best for your child, and they should be able to live as a child.

In conclusion no child should have to worry about juggling these tasks nor should they be worried about going missing, being bullied, or any stress that can mess with their mental health or their performance on school. This is why you should say no to involuntary activities placed by the schools.
