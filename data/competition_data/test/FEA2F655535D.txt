This article, "Drivless Cars Are Coming", talks about development of how close manufacturers are to a car that can drive itself. After reading this article, I personally beileve that they should create a car that can drive itself. I feel that if the car can drive itself, car accidents will decrease. The car could be aware of its surroundings, and be able to prevent an accident from happening. The car will have sensors and will be able to tell how close an object is.

People often get distracted when driving. Whether, it's a mother trying to help her child, a teenager recieving a text, or a person is fatigue. People can only focus on so many things before something goes wrong. The driverless car would be focusing on the road no matter what. This way, the "driver" doesn't have to worry when looking away for a spilt second. Some people don't have fast reflexes, and can't brake on time, the senors could help with all this.

The driverless car can help with people who cannot drive, like the elderly. An elderly person cannot drive themselves around when nobody else can. WIth this car, it can solve that for them. With the elderly in this car that can drive itself, instead of the elderly person driving, it would be safer for the elder person and other people on the road. The elder wouldn't have to worry about not being able to look at the signs or farway objects anymore, since the car will be in control.

I do understand that something could go wrong with the car when in use. I beileve that there should be some sort of precautions set, in cause of faulty of product. Who would be the one to blame? It should all depend on evdience. If it was built wrong, then the manufacturer. If the person in the car knew something was wrong, and decided not to get it fix, the person is at fault for not fixing the problem before anything happened.

I beileve that driverless cars should be produce. I feel that it could change everything for the better. It could make life more simple, and easy. It could decrease car accidents. No more worrying about taking every turn you take is a bad one. You wouldn't have to worry if you're not quick enough to stop. The driverless car could help with problems when driving.
