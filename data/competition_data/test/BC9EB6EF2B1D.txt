Extracurricular activities are an excellent way for students to expand their knowledge and skills beyond the classes they are taking in school. Many of these are beneficial in teaching you skills that will be valuable for the rest of your life, such as time management, balancing work, and working with others. I think that a principal making at least one extracurricular activity required is a great idea, as it would encourage students to step out of their comfort zone and attempt something they haven't before, build valuable skills for future careers, and be a good place to meet new people and socialize.

Many students are only focused on their academics in school, not doing much else outside of it. Requiring an extracurricular activity will definitely expose more students to additional opportunities. Joining a student organized band may encourage someone to pick up and start learning an instrument. Participating on a track team may help someone realize that they are a good runner. A student helping with the yearbook may find the graphic design aspect enjoyable and become a web designer. The more opportunities a person is exposed to, the more options they have for future careers and hobbies.

Another beneficial aspect of requiring an extracurricular activity is that many students would learn valuable skills that will help them out greatly later in life. Most clubs/activities promote teaching multiple life and career skills for those who join. Model United Nations teaches students problem solving and leadership skills. All sports activities promote living a healthy and active lifestyle. A community service club shows the value of helping your community, and helping those who are in need. Giving students a chance to learn more career skills will exponentially increase the chances of them being successful later in life.

One of the greatest parts of extracurricular activities is the people in them. You can meet some people with similar interests as you. Joining extracurricular activities would give everyone a much greater chance at finding some good friends, or at the very least some people to talk to while doing the activity. People in a coding or robotics club could find they have a mutual enjoyment of gaming. Someone in an art club may find that other people there enjoy the art style used in comic books. Students talking to people in these activities who share their interests would help them find friends they never would in their normal classes.

Extracurricular activities are a good thing for any student to join. Whether it be after school clubs, a sport outside of the school, or playing an instrument. It would give students new people to talk to and socialize with, skills for careers they may be pursuing currently or will be pursuing in the future, and would push people out of their comfort zone. The principal requiring extracurricular activities is a great idea, which would give many benefits to every student who participates.
