Dear principal,

I think that all students should have to do community service because with just a little help from everyone the world will be a good place. I think it is a got idea because there is to much stuff just wasted in this world I mean just by recycling you are helping a lot. Student should all care about our environment. There is a ton of people all over the world that are trying to keep the environment safe and save the wildlife that is around us. The students should care about what we have in our life. I really think that every student should just do something to help our environment and that we should all do some community service to help the environment.

I do not understand why you wouldn't help the environment. Look at all the different places in the world that are just covered with trash and other things. Look at all the places that have been in war and are still cleaning up from it like Vietnam we are still to this day looking for so of the American MIA/POWS that are still missing or the dead men that have never made it home for battle. People in general just need to help to cleanup our nation and this world. Look at the people who are unemployed cry about how they have no money wait I have a solution to that problem recycle can and other items. That is why i think we should have students do some community service. We will be live in a better places.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
