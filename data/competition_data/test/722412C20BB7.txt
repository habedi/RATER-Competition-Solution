I think you should let the ones that wants to do community service. Some people should not have to do something that they do not want to do. So the ones that wants to do it can because it is keeping our community clean. I would like if everybody would like to do community service, but if some people don't want to do it they don't. I'm not going to go to somebody and make them do some-

thing they would not want to do. If no-one doesn't want to do it then I would make everybody do it because nobody wants to do it. I would not care if they didn't want to do it or not.

Now if nobody would not do it then I would have everybody come to a room and then we talk about it. Then I will ask them who wants to do community service and if nobody raises there hand then I will tell them everybody going to do it then. We need people to keep our community clean like if you see something on the ground and pick it. Since nobody wants to do it I will make everybody go around and do community service. I would not want our community dirty and trashy because we got trash all over the streets when we can just been over and pick it up.
