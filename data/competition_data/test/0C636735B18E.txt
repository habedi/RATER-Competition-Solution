Summer projects are not as fun as they sound, Although, being able to design your own sounds interesting. As the school year ends, students expect an endless summer with adventures and tons of trips, however, a project must be due in the beginning of the next school year. Teachers begin to brainstorm ideas and assignments for the next school year as well. Allowing the students to design their own projects would make their summer a lot more interesting than it sounds. If the students designed their own summer projects it would make the students' summer more about creativity, it would allow the teacher to observe the students' mindset, and benefit the teacher to create a lesson comparing different perspectives.

The one thing every student has in common is the enjoyment of summer break. A one-to-two month period of no school, heavy sunshine, fun trips, long vacations, and valuable memories. Students expect to have fun and enjoy their summer break away from school. Allowing the students to design their projects would let the student now be more creative and will allow their brain to think more in depth about the project than when a teacher designs it. Their summer will be educational and entertaining.

In the first few weeks of school, teachers tend to struggle to get to know their students. If the student designed their projects, it will benefit them because they will be able to observe how their student thinks in different scenarios. They will save more time not only getting to know the student but grading as well, instead of multiple "get to know you" packets that they create every year. It will decrease the stress of getting to know the students they have that year.

When the new school year approaches, students expect to write about themselves and hear about the class criteria and behaviors. A quick lesson can be taught based on the projects the students designed. It would behoove the teacher to do a quick lecture about the assignment and why it was given. It becomes a great team building exercise as well by comparing the projects and explaining the goal of the assignment.

Overall, students designing their projects would not only benefit themselves but the teachers as well to learn about each other and the subject. Designing a project is not easy, having summer experiences can help with that. It would allow the student to embrace their creativity and think outside the box. It would also be helpful for the teachers to observe more on their students' mindset. Lastly, it would help the students and teachers' communication in education based on their overall observation.
