Using computer software to recognize emotions is not a good idea. The only person or thing that knows how we 100% truly feel is us. No one can tell us how we feel or how they think we feel, especially a computer. If a student is in class and he or she gets called up to the front to talk to the class the he or she knows if they sre scared, excited ect... We dont want to be scanned by a computer to see if they know how we feel.

Somtimes we put up fake emotions to try to fool others so they wont worry about how we really feel. They want us and computers to have better communucation. Not everyone trusts computers because they can always be hacked, traced, or malfunction. We have six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust,fear, and sadness.

Maybe it could be fine to have a computer that knows how you feel because if you're when you see a video/ad then it will play a similar one after that so you can stay happy. Or if you frown or are sad then they will swith the video/ad to make you happy. "A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored," "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This shows you hpw it can be a good thing but i see it as a bad thing. It is tryng to make things easier for you, but the real world is not easy. There is a lot of hard work and somtimes it wont get easy for you, so you shoudln't get used to things getting easier. The computer also changed things based on your emotion. If something bad happens in real life, a computer wont make it better. A lot of kids have done well in school and have gotten great jobs without a computer software that can read your emotions and make life easier.

It is good to see that they are trying to find a way for you to be happy but it is not a good idea. You need to know how to control and use your emotins, not a computer.
