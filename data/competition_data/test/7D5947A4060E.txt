Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should not allow students to have there cell phones at school. This is because cell phones are a big distraction to have during school hours.

Also because there is no reason for a student to have there cell phone at school. Another reason is that students could cheat on tests if they have there cell phone.

One reason why i think you should not allow cell phones is because they are a big distraction. even if you would let them use it at free times they would still have it in class and they would be able to text during a lesson or something else. This would affect there learning because they wouldn't be paying attention. If one of the students are texting another student in another class is texting too, so that is two people who are not paying attention.

Another reason would be that students shouldn't even need there cell phone during school hours. The only reason would be if they need to call a parent. Even then they should go to the office to call there parent if they really need to. they should not be allowed to call anyone they want though. Also if a student wants to text another student they could just talk at free times.

Lastly students shouldn't have there cell phones because they could cheat on tests or other assignments. Them having there cell phone could help them by them using it as a calculator or they could send messages to other students in the class and ask for answers. At times teachers do catch it but other times they don't.

In conclusion i do not think you should allow students to have there cell phone during school hours. If students have there cell phones it could be a distraction, a way to cheat on tests, and students could call with them when they should go to the office to. Students do not really need there cell phones at school at all.
