Research show that many students dont really like to go to schools that much. Some of them is fro the cause of bulling, dont like to see people that they dont like, which is the the cause that some of students dont really come to school. Is also effective for them and for their future to not attempt to school. Yet some students like to come to school. but sometimes its hard for them to come.

But the question is "

Why is it hard?".

Well, research shows that 95% of the students in FCPS dont attempt to school for this type of reason. Some other just dont like to come to school for other many reasons, or some school issues. Having to come to school is a problem for some students, or they just drop out of school for some reason. "

But, why do they drop out of school".

Well, some of them just decide not to come to school for these reasons.

They get a job, which makes them loose their focus from school.

They dont like some classes, or some people that they have to deal with, in school.

They think that school is not as important as how their job is.

These are the reasons why some students just decide not o come to schools no more, or just drop out.

But, the question is "

Should students receive classes from home using the internet or video conferencing?".

In my opinion, this could be helpful for some students. But, I dont thin k this could be the best idea that schools could have. Nor could be helpful for some. "

But why?".

Well, in this days we can see how technology is advancing in every single corner in the world, and we can also see how is effecting many students around the world. "

But how would these affect them?".

Simple. If students decide to take classes at home by computer or any electronic device aveliable at home. We can tell that they can easily get distracted by any other web. For example, is a students is receiving his classes through out any electronic device aveliable at home, and they get a message or notification from someone, or something. We know that they would want to respond to that massage, and thats going to make them loose their focus from the lesson.

Making these type of learning can be helpful for some students and it can also be helpless for other. In other words, there can also be some distraction from other home activities, of other need. So, making these type of learning,

In my opinion, is not the best type of learning that schools should give. For example, I cant focus in a lesson when I hear that my phone is ringing, vibrating, or watching it turning on over and over, and I have no doubts that these is one on the reasons why schools should not give these type of learning. Is just not the type of learning that we should get.

In conclusion, students should always try to attempt to school, even when they're having some difficult time to stay focus. Even in those moments where there areÂ some people that we dont like to see, and I totally understand that. Because, even I dont like some people in school. But, that does not mean that Im going to quit. "

Why?".

Because God gave every single on us a memory, and we just have to know how to use it. I also say this every time

"

quitting is not in my blood. If i fall down 7 times, I would rise up 8 times.", and yeah. This is a long way to go but we dont have to give up. We also have teachers that can help us in any time we need them. We have to try at least. But, my number one rule is

"Dont give up".

We also have God in our side, and he is the only one we need to keep going forward. Schools, teachers, assistance, and students. We have to know that giving students home learning can be useful. But the technology can also keep us from reaching our goals.
