Dear TEACHER_NAME,

We students all participate in some kind of sport, whether it be soccer or baseball, football or hockey, wrestling or golf. We all excel at our sport and we enjoy every sweet minute of it down the last grain of sand in the hourglass. Now you're threatening to take that away from us? We understand that school comes first, but without sports we are all just sticks in the mud. We lose our social skills, some of our friends, and even our spirit. So why take it away?

First off, We are threatened to lose our social skills. Sports is how we all interact with other people and with the world. What happens when we go to apply for a job and we are just too nervous or too unsocially educated to get it. Social skills is making new friends, if we don't do that then we will hardly ever if not never venture outside our circle of trust.

Next, some of us only get to see each other during sports because we don't go to the same school. We all have a tight bond with each other when we play, we don't necessarily have the same bond at school. Me for example, I only get to see my friend RELATIVE_NAME on Wednesdays and Saturdays for baseball practice. RELATIVE_NAME doesn't go to my school so i don't get to see him as often as my friend RELATIVE_NAME.

As well as social skills and friendships, it will crush our spirits. School just isn't fun whenever you don't have a sports activity afterwards. In fact that's why school is bearable for most of us students. You sit at a desk all day in five boring classes using your brain for six hours a day. It is boring, but its all the more worth-while if you have a game or practice to go to after.

Now we figured you'd counter all those reasons like school is more important, without an education your nothing, blah, blah, blah. Of course your right school is more important and we should have certain requirements on campus. But we're not talking about on campus we're talking about after school and the local park which gives you absolutely no right for us to have requirements outside of school grounds. That's our parents jobs to tell us to get our grades up or no baseball, not yours.

In conclusion, if we don't have sports our lives will be more miserable than an athlete trying to get away with steroids. It will crush spirits, friendships, and our social skills.

If your school is trying to do the same to you, write a letter to your principal or school board to prevent them from doing so.
