I strongly disagree with the school policy that the principal suggested , i say this because we have a lot of talented students in Pittsburgh SCHOOL_NAME who shine bright when they get out on that field or court and they can express their gift by showing every one what they can do as well as who there destined to be.

With no sports , you have to ask your self well what exactly is there for these guys . School work , student council , instrumental etc. is all cool but the boys here love sports and that's what they look forward to . Without sports some might not want to attend this school , middle school is were your journey begins , its were you get recognized early and family and friends come out to see you and most important recruiters .

Now i know you may say the students at SCHOOL_NAME need to focus on there school work and get there grades at decent level , and that i do agree on but on the other hind sometimes a B average , most struggle to get to. Its possible but for most not easy. You may also say if the students get involved in sports with low grades , sports will soon become there first priority , but you can always maintain sports and keep a C average , that's not asking for to much. Get a C average and you'll want to do better. Just to know your the man in sports and keep your head in the books , hey don't sound to bad to me.

With that being said , all i' am asking is for you to look into what i said, either way its up to you but i hope my reasons can change your choice, are find away to make other options. The boys as well as the girls here , love sports and if you have to keep a B average. Some may not succeed in that. Most will strive to be on the team so much , yet cant keep a B so they give up on everything , school work and more. We as a Pittsburgh SCHOOL_NAME team wouldn't want that , sports is our way of bonding and creating new friend ship , sit back relax and enjoy the game.
