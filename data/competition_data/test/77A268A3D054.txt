My postion on driverless cars are simple reasons why i dont trust them .I wouldnt feel safe walking down the treeet know ing that a driverless car is driving 25-30 miles next to me and them mess up and hit me. There are so many reasons why we shouldnt and here just a few .

I feel that driverless cars have some faults because for some big reasons succh as if we get into and accident who would know what happened would it be ther car or the driver and it would take a long time to figure out .

Another reason would be that if they had driverless cars we wuld have to have a special liscense and so many people would have to retake the driiver test and so much more. Its crazy because the fact is this that people would have so much of a harder time of driving the driverless cars because you never know when the car will mess up and you have to take over theres so much little detail that we havent worked out yet .

I feel that if we were to have driverless cars that people wouldnt know how to act that some people would be stupid with them and we already have a problem with texting and driving, i feel like his would bring the same concept to people .If we can be hand free with out driving it would be crazy people would be doing the craziest stuff if they were hand free.

Then there the way in part of the article it said "even if traffic laws change we would need new laws to in the case of an accident " so why do we need smart cars when in all reality we just need people to pay atttention to the road .Fot my conclusion i feel that were fine with cars that have a driver and that i feel its more safer than driverless cars .
