Dear school principal,

I think that the you should use Policy 1.

You should use it, because if the teacher tells the student that the volleyball practice is canceled and if you don't have a office phone, then the student can't tell his/her parents about it.

Also, another reason is that, the students won't have to keep on complaining about not having their phone all the time.

When the students get out of school, (on the bus) they can call their parents, if they are going to a friends house.

They can also call the parents with their cell phones, when their after-school activity is done, so then the parents can pick them up.

What if there is an emergency(like a flood is coming) and the office phone is broken. Then, they could get their cell phones out and call their parents and tell them about it, so then the parents can pick them up, before the emergency comes.

The students can call their friends at lunch(if their friend has a phone or has the same lunch as them), so then they could just sit their talking on the phone, while eating.

If the student don't turn their cell phones off during class time, then you should punish them by giving them(any of these):

-a detention

-write an essay that's about why they didn't turn their cell phones off

- apologize to their teacher and let the teacher do the rest

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
