Phones and Cars

Cars are a very expensive item in life and are used for everyday transportation. Phones are somewhat an important necessity and play an important role in many of our lives. Combined together has always been a horrible idea but many believe that they should be allowed to be on the phone while operating their vehicle. Cars and Phones should never be allowed together because of the many risks it could cause to the safety of many people.

Cars were created as another way of transportation and take you basically anywhere you need to go, throughout the year's many car companies have improved the technology that goes into the cars to make them more safe and reliable for the customers. New features have made cars super safe but many people tend to use their personal electronics while driving and it can lead to many incidents. Cars do a lot in everyday life and when people decide to use their phones while driving it causes many bad and sometimes deadly accidents. Many casualties are sometimes blamed on the car companies for the accidents but more investigation shows that many car accidents are caused by distracted drivers that use their phones whilst operating their vehicles. Car companies have been made to pay millions in lawsuits because of people not taking responsibilities and putting their phone down rather being distracted and still finding a way to beat the system to sue the car companies.

Phones are an important essential that many that have the privileges to have and provide so much for everyday life. The technological advantages that many phone companies like Samsung and Apple have put new technology that offers the driver to turn on driving mode which basically turns off every notification. This is very helpful and very useful because it helps the driver is more focused on the road and less distracted with his or her phone. Phones used to only be household items that were usually kept on the walls of the homes and usually could only be used in the homes. Phones were very essential to those who were fortunate enough to have them because they were able to communicate with family and friends across the country. However, those who could not afford phones were not fortunate enough to buy them whereas those who could have the opportunity to do anything.

Phones and Cars have never been a good idea combined together because of the many risks it carries. On average, deaths caused by cell phone usage whilst operating a vehicle is roughly above 1.6 million deaths per year. People do not realize how dangerous it is to operate their vehicle while being distracted and they take it for granted because in a split second that can all be taken from you in the snap of a finger. Many argue that they can multitask and use their phone whilst operating their vehicle. Although, car companies have made attempts to improve the technology for drivers to become less distracted but they still distract themselves.

In conclusion, I believe that Cars and phones should never be allowed together but there is no way to prohibit cellular phones and it's tragic but if we made an effort to cut down on this distraction there will be a change in that number of deaths.
