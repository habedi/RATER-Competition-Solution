Dear principal,

We both know that cell phones have become an issue. Now is the time to decide what you're going to do about it. You could go with policy 1 and allow cell phones on school property or you could go with policy 2 and ban them entirely. It is your choice, but I would recommend policy 1 for several prominent reasons.

First off, knowing that you have considered this, what about emergencies? For example a fire. Is it not best that everyone already has a way to call for transportation home or to a safer place? You, the school, wouldn't have to look up all the phone numbers of all of your students. You wouldn't have to wait with them at the high school for board provided buses. All you would have to do is make sure they have a ride and that would be hard because they tend to have a lot of friends.

Secondly, policy 1 is the better compromise between school rules and parents. You out of all people know what its like to be constantly bombarded with calls from parents about this and that. Why not just meet them halfway on this issue and let them call their kids during the given times. Also having this free period of phone usage is also good for teachers who have children or even teachers who have other important meetings.

Lastly, policy 1 is the better policy because it also benefits teachers. In every class there is a bad egg. Sometimes they do it purposely , but most of the time it was just chance that a student HAD to use their cell phone during class. The free periods are just that free, so that students can text, call, and message who ever they need to. Thus making them more prepared to handle class time. After the break they would have gotten it out of their system.

Hence. although it would just be easier to just say "no" to cell phones altogether , this policy will be better in the long run. Also, some people may say that its giving them free rule to use their cell phones, this way of handling the cell phone issue will help the student to be less tempted. Even I, sometimes, just want to break rules for the fun of breaking rules and sticking it to the man. This doesn't mean that they will. So, in conclusion, just be aware of who it
