Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I agree with your new policy for having a grade B average because then you make the students push themselves so they can reach there full potential. Even thought i have a grade C average i can make it so that i get it up to a B. For children that have a grade C average and they play sports they can stay after to catch up on papers or they can get extra help by asking there teachers. Another thing that can help then is they can study the classes that there not doing well on even if its 5 to 10 minutes a night it will hep them. They can also go home online to look at what homework they have and do it ahead of time so you are not rushing. Next reason i think it is a good idea for that policy is so that people that need help or have a grade C average will work to get it a B.

Which means that they have better grades to get into college with and for the sport if they want to they can try and get a scholarship. Even thought there are some bad things about the policy there is a lot of good things to this policy they can also get to have more privileges with school if there grade are up. i appreciate that you might make this a policy because it makes me push myself to the full potential i can be and that makes me feel good.

Scincearly ,

Your student
