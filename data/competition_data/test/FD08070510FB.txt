Dear Principal,

I believe you should chose Policy 2. I believe you should chose policy 2, because some students might need to call their parents to get a ride home or to see if a friend can come over or if they can go to a friends house. Although some teachers may say having cell phones at school at all is a bad idea because they might get them out in class anyway.

You should chose policy 2 over policy one because some kids have to bring their phone to school because they could have something after school and need a way to get a hold of their parents to come get them. If it were against the rules to have their phone at school at all they would still bring it but then they would get in trouble for it.

The opposing argument is that cell phone will be a major distraction and that students will get them out in class even if they aren't allowed to have them at school, but the only reason they would get them out is if it was really important. If we were allowed to have them at lunch then why would we get them out in class?

If you would rather chose policy 1 then maybe you could allow the students to have their phones at school but not get them out during the day. You could let us have our phones out only when our work is done and we have nothing to do, and that would make us work harder in class if we knew we could have our phone out just a few minutes.

It would be way cooler to let us have our phones out at school, but if we can't can we at least have our phones at school? So we could go to the office and call our parents if we have to.
