What are the benefits from doing online classes school at home?

There are so many ways online classes can benefit students who can not always attend school everyday. You might not understand lots of kids have different reasons for their absents in school, and this is why most kids do not graduate on time with their peers. Schools do not see or think about why the students do not come to school everyday they just think students are lazy and just don't want to come to school; however, all people have different reasons for not attending school. Online classes could change all that in so many was for instances: stopping violence, no attending school problem ,or it could be even helping with their own needs at home. For this purpose, I believe students should have the option to attend classes from home.

The ability to stay home and do work on the computer could make a big differences in violence from happening to students in school. Students don't need to fear of getting bullied, school shooting, fire hazard, nor getting injured in school. The benefits for staying home is you don't have to worry about getting made fun of by other students and you can be yourself. People change the way they are by what others say in school. This is called peer-pressure and kids in school go through that all the time. Students don't need to worry about school shooting happening if not attending. Shootings happen by people being reckless and some people shoot up school for no reason or tries to go for a specific person, but others get in the way. Well, that couldn't be the case if you stayed home and you wouldn't be part of any drama. Violence between students mostly happens because of what he or she said. Injurers happens all the time too. As an example, It takes a while from coming from one side of the school to the other side just to get your back up inhaler which then, the nurse have to find it as while. When your at home you you know where everything is and don't have a problem. You have a better chance of being social at home with familiar faces with out any harm.

Lastly online classes could definitely help with just personal needs at home. Some kids need to get a job to help provide for their families, or just need to stay home to watch their younger siblings while the parents go off to work to pay for the bills. Not to mention this is why the attends are so bad now. The kids are trying to help their family with stuff at home most can't even get any sleep with all this stress in their hands. This is why we need class online so we have the ability to have some free time to do other things. On the other hand, school just don't do that for theirs students they have to wake up in the morning, and go to school for 7 hours. Why would you do that when you could just go on the web and do your work at the time you want. The best benefits of online school is you could get the work done faster and you could graduate early too. If you need help they have video conferencing; however students don't really need it. Most students in school get their answers from the internet and some just can't comprehend the way teachers teach. Therefore, your really doing the same thing at home but much more easier.

After what all I have provide with evidence I believe students would benefit from online classes at home. Some might disagree some might agree with me. This mainly depends on the students problems they might not have a problem they just like to learn on their own, or just want to be independent to be prepare for college expectation. The option to attend online school or video conferencing was a smart idea to come up with. If I was able to choose if I wanted to do online or go to school now, I would definitely pick online so I can finish school early to help my family out. My position on this issue would be it's the students choice to know what is best for them to get their education it's not anyone else education... it's the students.
