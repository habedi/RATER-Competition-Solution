PROMPT : SOME SCHOOLS REQUIRE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE SUMMER PROJECTS TO ASSURE THEY CONTINUE LEARNING DURING THIER BREAK. SHOULD THESE SUMMER PROJECTS BE TEACHER-DESIGNED OR STUDENT-DESIGNED? TAKE A POSITION ON THIS QUESTION. SUPPORT YOUR RESPONSE WITH REASONS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES.

Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? While some say that they would like student-designed projects, other may want teacher-designed projects. There's some reasons why students chose either one.

Although some say they want student-designed projects, some want teacher-designed projects. The main reason why students may want teacher-designed projects is because they not have any inspiration on what their project should be designed as, if they did it themselves, (without any requirements or checklists). While having a teacher-designed projects, teachers may list requirements and all for the project to make sure students are going on the right track to getting a good grade for the project. Having followed the teachers requirement list for the project, students may live up to exactly what teachers expect for the project.

While some had said that they enjoy teacher-designed projects, some say that they actually enjoy student-designed projects. The main reason why students may want student-designed projects is, during summer break, students may travel or do many other things, and they could do their project(s) based on their activities. Students may show lots of their creativity skill, which could help them get a good grade on the project. While having to create their own project from scratch,students may develop many ideas for their project(s).

Some say that neither teacher nor student-designed projects could be assured that students would continue learning during summer break. Students would want to not do any type of school-related work, except relax during summer break. Students might not finish their projects because they weren't in town, or they didn't have time to buy supplies..etc. Another reason why students might be able to finish their projects on time is that they might have jobs and work all day, everyday in the summertime, so it could be a little hard for them to finish on time.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher or student-designed based on the students decision, because it could be challenging for students...
