In the United States children must attend school by law. Traditionally school has been a place that students must physically go to. In recent years, new technology, like the internet and video conferencing, has changed education and school systems. Today some schools allow students to attend classes online instead of physically being in the classroom. Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they would not learn vital social skills, bulling would increase, and they would not get to experience school.

Students would lack critical social skills by attending class from home. School is a place where students learn but also socialize with their peers. Through this socialization students are taught what is socially acceptable to do in public, how to read people, and how to carry a face to face conversation. Students that only communicate online or over video miss out on learning these skills. When talking through text messages, the meaning of the message can be misinterpreted. In face to face conversations it is easy to understand the meaning of a message by looking at the person's facial expressions and body language. For example, if someone said, "I'm dying" over a text message it would be interpreted that they were actually dying. However, this person most likely meant it as an expression and if they had said it in person it would have been interpreted as a joke by looking at their upbeat facial expression. By attending school online and not physically interacting with people, students miss out on learning social skills that are needed in everyday life as well as the workplace. Due to students lacking social skills they are more likely to hurt someones feelings which could turn into bullying.

By attending classes from home, students would face an increase in bullying because it is easy to hide behind a screen. In recent years there has been an increase in bullying though social media. This is because people don't have to face the consequences of their actions or words because they are protected by a screen and user name. Students brains' are not fully developed yet and they often don't understand how hurtful words can be. By not physically seeing the impact their remarks make on someone, students are more likely to say hurtful things that they would not say to someone in person. An example of this that occurs everyday is when people comment mean things on a picture someone else posts. The people that post these mean comments would never say these things out loud or to that person face to face. This is because they would have to have confidence and face potentially retaliation. By saying it online a person can hide behind a persona and user name and never know how that person was impacted by their words. Communicating and interacting through a screen can not only hurt others but cause students to miss out on important experiences.

Students would miss out on experiencing school by attending classes from home. Many people say that high school is the best time of your life. Students would not get to experience attending pep rallies, hanging out with friends between classes, and being apart of a community. School is a place for students to discover who they are and try new things. By attending classes online students would not get to experience these things. Viewing things through a screen is not a way to live life. If students don't experience classic school things, they miss out on a whole aspect of life. Watching a video of something happening is not as moving or memorable as experiencing it yourself. You wouldn't feel the nervous energy of a class before a test or the sense of belonging you get when the whole school sings the school's fight song at a pep rally. By attending classes online students would miss out on many experiences that they don't get later on in life.

Some people may say that students would benefit from attending classes from home because it would be more accessible. However, this is not necessarily true because not everyone has access to internet at their house. Students that do not have a computer or internet access will suffer and be at a disadvantage because they would not be able to access their education. Attending classes from home would not benefit students because they would not know social skills, would face more bullying, and miss the experience of going to school.
