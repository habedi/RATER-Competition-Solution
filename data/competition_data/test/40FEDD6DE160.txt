Recently schools have been assigning summer projects. These projects are issued to make sure that students continue learning during their break. When assigning these projects, schools should have them be teacher designed. Having the summer projects be teacher designed would require one to take the project more seriously than it would be had it been student designed. Students would also not be allowed to come up with last minute, random, or even stolen, ideas. If schools required summer projects they should be teacher designed.

Summer projects being teacher designed requires that the student take the project more seriously. When students are allowed to come up with their own ideas for big assignments it is likely that they will not put maximum effort into it. Many students, middle and high school students specifically, do not take school seriously until they are given structure. With students today, order is required to get work done. To have an idea presented to them, rather than telling them to come up with one on their own, it is more likely that the work or assignment would actually get completed. For example; when students are writing essays teacher give them a topic or prompt so the student is able to have a structured and completed paper. Teachers know that if their students are not given order with their assignments the work would just not get done, these are with small, classwork, assignments. Issuing teacher designed summer projects allow for well thought out, structured, work.

Having a summer project that is teacher designed assures that the students are not able to come up with last minute ideas, ones that they put no thought into or even one they stole from someone else.. Many students today lack the effort and motivation to come up with a real, well thought out idea for a project. Assigning a student a project that they would be able to design on their own would not be structured and would most likely not be original. With the advancements in technology students have more access to other peoples ideas through online pictures and websites, which reduces creativity. When a school system requires students to do projects that are designed by teachers over the summer it increases the chances of it getting done and the project would most likely be neater and more planned.

One could argue that having the project be student designed allows students to spend their summer how they would like to. However; students often find themselves with a lot of free time during the summer and think they have nothing to do. This time should be used to work on their project. If the project were teacher planned the student could find a way to have fun with it but also continue learning as well which would help them be prepared for the next school year. After some work, one could be influenced to get out of the house or go out and make plans with one's friends and do what they wish to with their summer break. Teachers could give the students many different options to the students or even make the project summer related so that way the teacher gets work done and the student gets to enjoy their summer and learn at the same time. Schools requiring teacher designed projects has more benefits than requiring student designed projects.
