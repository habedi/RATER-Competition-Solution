Any extracurricular activity can help any child in one way or another. The principal at my school is mandating every student to participate in an extra curricular activity, do I agree with this decision? I firmly agree with the decision the principal made because it can help keep students out of trouble, teach them how to manage their time and stress, and it can help improve social skills and help children make friends.

The first reason this was a good decision is that it can teach students how to manage their time and stress. If they had a mandatory homework it could discipline them and teach them to do their homework and when to do their homework. My example would be that doing wrestling and football has taught me that I should do my homework as soon as possible and to work hard at school so I can have less work to do at home. If students learned how to manage their time and stress then that can prepare them for high school, college, and even the real world!

Next, another reason the principal made a good decision is that it can help improve teamwork, communication, and can help students find out their hobbies and what they like to do. If students find out what they would like to do like a sport or any other activity, that activity could stick with them their entire life. If there's somebody that isn't very active or social and this activity teaches them how to talk to other people and they make friends then they can just have a more happy, and fulfilled life in general. In my experience I made a bunch of friends from sports and extra curricular activities that I will have for a long time.

After that, the third reason I agree with the principals decision is that it can help keep kids out of trouble. If students have activities that take up a lot of their time then there will be less time for them to get involved with things that will get them in trouble and more time for them to find out what they enjoy doing. If there are more students that are doing what they enjoy rather than getting into trouble, with less students getting into trouble the school and community could benefit from the principals decision.

I believe that the principal made a good decision because it can help keep kids out of trouble, help them find friends, and teach them how to manage their time and stress.
