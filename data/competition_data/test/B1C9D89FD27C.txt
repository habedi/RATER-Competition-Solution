Dear Principal

I disagree with the new policy of sports and activities. Kids shouldn't play a sport just because of there grades. They should be allowed to play a sport just the fact that it makes them become have confidence, have communication , and show off their skills.

By playing sports kids become confident in what they do. It teaches them to never be shy and face your fear. They learn that when show a project to someone it is the same thing like playing your sport, the fact that people stare is not as bad as what it seems.

It lets them have communication towards their teammates. By communicating it doesn't let them become shy around anybody. They learn that they should just say what is on their mind. They become more influent talkers and know what they need help on with speaking.

They can show how great they are at something. They may be bad at something, but they know that they are good at something for sure. It shows that are ever talented at what they do and also that they put a lot of courage and effort.

We shouldn't let kids play sports just because of their grades maybe after all they are good at something.

Sincerely:

Student
