This "face marking" on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientist discovered Mars many years ago and they did not see no signs of life on this planet or this face was not see on this planet. How can a "face" just natural appear of Mars when no one is on there?

Why would NASA hide a big discovery of something like this to the people. If NASA found out or new there were any signs of life on Mars, I would expect there to be a newcast of that or somehting else in that matter.

Some Scientist believe that it is alien made structure, but other scientist believe it is just a land formation. It is just a land formation because, shadows are making up its nose, eyes, and mouth. Others believe it is a butte or a mesa, which are land formations around the American West. The image of the "face" looks just like a hill or rounded very small mountaion top. The "face" even has changed over the years. Many things change by erosion or the weather,so i believe it is just a mesa that has changed over the years. The markings were not hidden by some kind of an "alien haze" it was simply the weather. Planets other than earth have diferent kind of weathers also. There is something in the United States that is simulaur to the "face", it is a small lava doom and it is the same height as the "face".

Scientist believed that there is somekind of an alien face on Mars, but there isnt it is just a mesa or a butte. Which is a small landmass. If there was an ancient civilization or still life on Mars, we would be able to see it, unless they are just great at hinding. Even if there were civilzations on Mars wouldn't we be able to see more artifacts? The land mass has also changed in the pass years, probably by ersion or wether. There is also shadows that are reflectind over the land mass, to show its distinct characterristics, like the nose, mouth, and eyes.
