Driverless cars are a thing of the future.

With as many companies working towards driverless cars: Google, Toyota, BMW, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, I think we'll have streets full of the in no time.

I think driverless cars are a fantastic idea.

Humans have flaws, and machines do too, but if we could manufacture a car smart enough to know how to navigate in traffic on its own, and when and where to stop a humans flaws would not be an issue.

We have too many distractions in our lives, and needless to say we're thinking about those things while we're driving.

"The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own." -paragraph 5.

This indicates that driverless cars are safer than manual ones, and that they use less energy.

With cars as sensitive as these, there would be fewer accidents as well.

There are a few issues with the case: "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultÂ—the driver or the manufacturer?" -paragraph 9.

On the other hand, by the time driverless cars are on the streets we should have most legal issues worked out.

All in all, I think self-driving cars are safer than manual ones.

With as many distractions as we have in our lives, we really do not need another thing to be worrying about.
