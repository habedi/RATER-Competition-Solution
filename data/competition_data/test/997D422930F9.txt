Dear Principal,

I don't think its right to require all students to perform community service. Some students live in dangerous areas where its unsafe to go outside. Others may not be able to work due to how late their parents get back from work or it may interfere with doing homework. Some students won't do any work because their's no incentive to work other than you telling them to.

You should take safety as a big reason not to require students doing work for community. In the day and age we live in there are too many things that could harm somebody.

There are sexual predators, gangs, serial killers, and kidnappers. If a student is in a gang and is out doing a group community project and a rival gang member sees that student everybody else could be in danger of a drive by shooting and multiple people could be seriously injured or even killed. With the numbers of gangs rising in the U.S. there's no telling who could be in a gang or not. Sexual predators is also a major concern. When you have a couple of teenagers on the side of the road cleaning it would be easy to kidnap someone and rive off.

Another reason why you shouldn't require students to work is because some parents don't get home till really late at night. Usually by the time my mom and step dad get home its already dark outside and to late to do anything. Working after school would be the main time students would have to work and after school is when students are doing their homework. Even if your doing your community a good thing having students grades drop doesn't look good on the school.

I know a lot of kids who wouldn't work even if they were forced to. If all you do is simply tell all the students they have to do community service then very few people will want to work. Even if you bring in rewards for working some kids would say, " Woo a bike! My birthday is in a month I can wait." On top of not wanting to work they have leadership classes that are solely based on doing good things for the community for those who want to.

All of these reasons are why you shouldn't require students to do community service.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
