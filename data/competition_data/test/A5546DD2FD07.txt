Dear principal,

I think that all the students in the school should do community service at school and at home. helping the community is very important, in fact i did community service when i was in elementary school. In the sixth grade i was in a girls club and every Friday we would go to the Ronald McDonald house and help out with the planting and the cleaning. After it was all over we would get rewarded with a treat and a prize so that we wouldn't feel like we did it for nothing. You should tell the kids that helping the community is very fun and it keeps you community clean so that it wont be looking nasty and filthy. On a personal note I would enjoy helping the kids with the gardening and the and the cleaning because it will help them see that even older people can do it to.

Helping the community is very important because it helps the community look like new. If you keep the earth looking filthy the that will start pollution and that is very bad for the community. It will start to get foggy all the time and the earth will start to stink and it will mess up the roads and the grass. I don't think the kids would want that will they? Sometimes you have to get off your back and clean up. it will be a great experience for the kids because it will help them realize that helping isn't such a bad thing and it will make things a lot better for them. You should go for the chance and see what will happen if you make a right decision. My mom always says that helping is a nice way to winning someone's respect and attention. My mother is a wise women and she always knows what to say. In fact everyone's parents are very wise and intelligent it's just that the children don't see it yet.

The children are so caught up in video games and T.V. that they don't realize what they should do at home and in the community. So take the chance and try to see if they will help out or cop pot on what they're suppose to do. Just take my advice: " There is no way out on what u do in life".
