To TEACHER_NAME,

All the students are so exited that you are considering a new rule for cell phones inside of school. The entire school cant wait until you announce your opinion and rule. As you know almost ninety percent of the student do have cell phones in school. They are hoping that you allow cell phones in school and I do as well. I know that we will be able to respect they new responsibility and respect the consequences given out.

A lot of the staff has said that the cell phones cause a major distraction for students that are using the phones or sitting next to a person who is. I understand their concern with this but sometimes is not the students phone who goes off in the middle of class. The majority of the teachers have their phones on in class and some times answer them during our lesson. I know that teachers do their best to help us learn but if they can have their phones out for a couple of minutes during class why cant we have them out for the same time when we are not in class?

The major reason for someone to get a phone is because of their safety or an emergency. Inside of school we all do the our best to be safe through out the day but what if we are outside during physical education. We could get hurt and the need for a call to the nine-one-one operator may be necessary. The students phone could help to make the call more faster while they notify the school. Also a school field trip may be a place where we may need our phones in case of an emergency. This is the reason why our parents gave us the cell phones in the first place.

Many of the students also like to talk to their friends that they may not get to see at all during their day. Cell phones let us communicate with them. The responsibility that comes with a cell phone is greater than just not loosing it. Our parents make sure that our grades are good and we have good behavior. After all of this is in place then we get our phones. I know that all students want to keep their phones so in order to do this we will fallow the rule given out to us. when teachers take our phones in class and give us referrals they think that nothing else will be done to us but they are wrong. Our parents will give us their own punishment and make sure that we don't have our phones in school. None of the students at the school want this so the privilege will not be taken for granted and we will fallow the new regulation the you give to us.
