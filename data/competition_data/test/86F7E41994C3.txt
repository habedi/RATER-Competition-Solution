Although Scientist believed that the face was an alian artifact, i dont believe so, maybe it was just a wierd shape on mars they had saw, and assumed it was an alian,it could have just been how mars looked from where they were, or how it just looks in general. perhaps it was just a natural landform on mars, i think so. after more researching, comes to find out it was actually a natrual landform on mars, scientists are not always right, 50% of the time they are false, an the other 50% of the time the are positive. i think people were just wanting it to be a alian, so scientists did all this research, to find out and see what it was.

when scientist decribed this face they seen on mars, "A shadowy likeness of a human face" "an enormous head" "Was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called -Cydonia", yes it does sound like it would be an alian based on how theyre decribing it, but wouldnt you think it could be anything other then an alian?, i think so, not everything with a shadowy like figure of a human has to be an alian, it could be anything really. Like just some natrual figure on mars. therefor this was not an allian artifact on mars, turns out it was just some natrual figure on mars.
