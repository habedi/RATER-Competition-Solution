Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

Please do not consider changing the school policy! The average grade in the United States is a C. Most people, try as they might, cannot get a grade above a C!

Most of these students depend on sports! If they know that they are not talented academically, they will try their luck elsewhere, i. e, sports. So many students get sports scholarships nowadays! If the principal will not allow these athletes to play sports, they probably will not be able to practice elsewhere, and then they will fail both academically and physically. Is that what miss principal wants? Does she want to take away young students' opportunities of getting into a good college? If that is so, then so many talented students would end up going to somewhere like Rochester College instead of Yale University.

More than half the student population in the United States are obese! And 10% of those people are morbidly obese. If miss principal wants her students to suffer from obesity AND poor grades, then principal should not take away the students' right to play sports with a grade lower than a B! If miss principal wants more students to die from atherosclerosis, stroke, blood clot, hemorrhage, hypertension, myocardial infarction (fancy way of saying heart attack), liver disease, or anything else that is often associated with obesity, the student population will rapidly decrease, and miss almighty principal will not get a decent amount of money from her job. Is that what you want?

Without proper exercise and sports, many people will be prone to falling ill. It won't be fair if only the smartest of the smart nerds get proper exercise and defense against viral infections! More and more people will get sick, and the more people that get sick, the more it will spread, and the more absences there will be. Trust me; I would know. Before I started playing soccer and basketball last year in seventh grade, I was a sickly child. Every time a virus went around the school, I would catch it and get sick (and I was pretty fat). However, now, I have a defense mechanism from getting proper exercise from exceptional coaches, and I haven't gotten sick in a year and a half. This proves that everyone needs proper exercise to stay fit and healthy, and the best way to get the exercise is through a school sport, such as basketball, cheer, soccer, football, etc.

So miss wonderful amazingly awesome principal, please consider my thoughts while you decide whether you change the school policy or not.

Thank you for reading my letter regarding this subject. I greatly appreciate it.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
