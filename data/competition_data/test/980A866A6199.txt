Dear, State senator

Voting is a public thing that happens every fourth year when a President is resining or cannidating for a second run. People all around the United States vote for a President they think can run the country the best. I think it's not fair that our votes are getting thrown away, and not even looked at. Bradform Plumer said that "the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational (source 2 paragraph 14), and i think that is true. I think we should Bannish the Electoral College because it is a old process, unfair to Americans, and can lead to disasters.

The Electoral College is a very outdated process. Dont you think we should use a new one? The Elctorial College has been use since the 13 Colnies, and has been ignoring the public ever since. I think its only fair if we have a part in the president election. Also, if we could change it to popular vote, more people would be intact with politics. Bradford Plumer says that "the eclection is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. (source 2 paragraph 12). I agree with him because the Electoral College is very old and can break at any time. I think its time that we change that and start fresh.

America's saying is "home of the free, land of the brave"; well its not free if we cant vote for our president we want, and the government does it for us. Bradford Plumer says that the electorial college is unfair to voters, and candidtaes because of the winner takes all system (source 2 paragraph 13). The winner takes all system is states choosing if the are going to pick a republician president or demicrate president. Lastly. it is unfair to us. We have no power against the government, and our votes mean nothing to them.

The Electoral College can also lead to disasters! Riaets can flood the streets if they dont like the legislators choice, and that can lead to deaths. Secondly, shootings could start to occuring around the states, and can get out of hand. Inicent silvilians can get hurt for no reasons. Lastly, there can be financial crashes, and everyone around the states could go in dept.

to sum up my letter i think the Electorial College should be bannished for good. You have heard that it is a old process and can lead to falure, it is unfair to americans, and it can lead to disasters all around the country. Give the Americans what they want, freedom!
