Students are like baby chickens. They need a leader and proper guidance to ensure they prosper in life. Teachers can be and usually are that mother hen for their students. This applies to many circumstances whether it is in school, during the summer, or even after college. Planning projects in the summer, a perfect time for students to grow and expand their knowledge, is an area that most teachers are experts on. Some people may say projects given during the summer should be designed by the students. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed because students cannot be held accountable and need guidance.

Summer projects should not be student-designed because students are not trustworthy. The majority of students will search for an easy way out and try to make the project as simple as possible. This is completely divergent to a teacher's mindset. They enjoy pushing students out of their comfort zone so they have a better chance to improve and grow. Students cannot be held accountable to design a summer project that will challenge their mind because of their lack of motivation. In addition, students are not responsible enough to be bestowed with the task of creating their own project. Without a doubt, they will prioritize relaxation and fun over learning and hard work, especially in the summer. As a repercussion, it is a waste of time for the student and teacher, since the student did not put forth their best effort. Some people may say students should create their own summer projects so they can take the initiative and learn to be independent. However, they are wrong because students cannot be held accountable for their actions due to their lazy mentalities. Teachers benefit from challenging students, which is why teacher-designed summer projects ensure that students continue to learn.

Another reason teachers should design summer projects is because most students still need assistance and guidance. Teachers are more experienced in life and share their wisdom with children. Nevertheless, they know what activities and projects stimulate the brain and help students learn better. With this additional knowledge, they are better suited to plan and organize projects. For many students, their brain continues to develop and their pre-frontal cortex develops last. As a result, they rely on their amygdala, which is why they do not have the best decision making skills. When asked to create a project, some students do not know where to start because they need guidelines to accomplish a task. For this reason, teachers are always there to help and give guidance. They look out for their students and give encouragement because they want what is best for them. Many people say that schools should give students permission to design summer projects as a way to give them more freedom and allow them to express their creativity. Although, they are incorrect because students still need guidance since they do not have as much experience compared to adults and for the reasont that their brains are still developing.

Clearly, summer projects should be teacher-designed due to the lazy mentalities and ongoing brain development of students. Children cannot be trusted to create their own project because they will not challenge themselves enough, especially compared to a teacher. Students still require guidance because their brain is still developing and teachers provide beneficial wisdom. It is essential that these projects stimulate the brain so student continue to learn over summer. Without a doubt, teachers should definitely create summer projects because if they didn't, students might be robbed of a prosperous future.
