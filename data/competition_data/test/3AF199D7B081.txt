The summer projects that insure students are continuing to complete their tasks during summer break, should be a student-designed, because of a more educational project that gives students a clear understanding on how to complete the project. Furthermore, teacher will have a chance to know on what the students have learn about them over their past decade, which will help the students on what it should look like, and make it more professional. However, this should also help the students' work management to improve, this will also help teacher on they should teach their students about next year, and see as well their improvements. Nevertheless, the project will also help the chances of the students getting a high degree for college. Teachers and students will also know on what they did during summer to know kind of person they are.

Furthermore, the summer project keeps track on the students has done during summer, and what they should work on while they are on break to complete their project. Students will need to know what they did during summer, and school to create a time line and structure to begin their project. The students will gather events that have happen to them during break and school, they also need to gather a information about the events to have a clear understanding on what they didn't know, to add more details and to give more context on why it happen or how it happen. However, they can also ask their teachers to give insides on their option on the matter, as well more information that wasn't include in the medias that were being used by the students. Events that can happen during school are; protest, voting, partition, and changes to the school. Changes to the school either add new rules to the school, or gets rid of them to improve the school. Voting for a new school principal or adding new menu to the lunch. Partition to be part of something to stop or to bring upon the school. Protest to stop school shooting or to stop bullying another way to improve the school.

The summer project should be an student-designed to make it more professional and educational, but to also help teachers have a better understanding to their the person they are teaching, and what their experience were during breaks and what students felt on these events to make the project, and hopefully have a chance for a education and more improvements to work managements.
