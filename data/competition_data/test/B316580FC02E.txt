My Principal has decided that every student must do an extracirricularÂ activity in school. Most people disagree with this statement but I think otherwise. I agree with my principal because it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.

There are many students that sit inside, and dont go outside as much as the are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracirricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. there are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.

another good reason to have everyone do an extracirricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. . All the exercise in fooball is physical, working your legs and arms to burn off fat and build muscle. But you can also improve your confidence and determination.

Finally we have extracirricular activities acting as a great outlet for kids who have family problems and/or are bullied. Most kids who have big problems dont like to open up about them because they feel like they'll be judged or made fun of, but if they are on an engaging sports team, or are working on the yearbook they could have someone to speak with that they trust, or just something to get their mind off of their personal problems.

I hope this helped you get another perspective on how extracirricular activities could help our school. it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.
