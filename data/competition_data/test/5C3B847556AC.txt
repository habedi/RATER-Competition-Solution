The Electoral College has been in the Constitution since out founding fathers established it.  It was an agreement between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of President by a popular vote of citizens.

As we all know the Electoral College is a process which is the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress.  There are two political parties. Democrats and Republicans. Electors are usually chosen by the person running for office's political party, but each state has their different views on how they are selected and what their responsibilities are.  When the time comes, usually every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, presidential elections are held. This is the day citizens go out to their local polls and help their electors vote for President. It's not the citizens themselves who vote for the President, when citizens vote they're actually voting for their canidates electors.  The process of the Electoral College has been carried on since it was first put into the Constitiution. So, why change it now?

The Electoral College consists of over 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.  The citizens vote sometime in November in polls and wait for the election of the new President. As stated before, the citizens vote does not elect the president, it helps the electors choose. However, that doesn't mean that the citizens don't have a purpopse in voting. Popular vote is part of an election as well. It is rare that the Electoral College is higher in numbers that its popular votes. This is sometimes because states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all rubric.

This process requires a canidate to have trans-regional appeal, meaning there aren't favorites. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.  This also means the presidential canidate will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states they know they'll win in. This is a highly unlikely result that will outcome as a successful president. If this were to occur, voters in other states would feel discouraged and feel as if their votes do not count. This is why the Electoral College has this as a requirement.

In most toss-up states, voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and deciding or knowing who that they will decide to be president. They are most likely thoughtful voters and are perferred to be the ones to decide the election. In big states, the Electoral College adjusts the weight in the political balance that these states lose by population. In additon, large states get more attention of canidates in a campaign that the smaller states do.

These are just few of many resons why the Electoral college should stay as is. If they were to change the Electoral College, what would they do to elect a president? It would be chaotic and the people may rebel. In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College as it is should be the only process to elect a president.
