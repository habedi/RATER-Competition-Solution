Time, such a valuable commodity. Choosing how to spend your time is one of the many lessons to learn through adolescence. You could read a book, play a sport, study for a test, or procrastinate and play vidieo-games all day. Needless to say, time management is an important skill to learn and a freedom many enjoy. This is all why I strongly disagree with the principals new policy. All it is doing is restricting students rights and wasting their time, while requiring them to participate in a school sponsored activity they might havee no intrest in. For many kids, this system is just ludacris. Many already have packed schedules, have activities outside of school, or simply have no interest in school sponsored activities. All of these are valid reasons the principals new policy should be repealed.

Many students already have very tight packed schedules. Many cant handle homework or getting their work done on time. Taking an activity would do them more harm than good. For example, I am one of those kids. While I am definitely not bad at school, I am absolutely terrible at time management, which if I procrastinate too much causes my grades to dip quite a bit. With a policy of required activities, these kids, like me, would all be in even more of a struggle to complete their work. It would be complete pandemonium, rushing to get stuff done on time while also having to juggle a club or sport.

Speaking of clubs and sports, many kids associate with clubs or sports unrelated to school. From my understanding, this policy would require kids to take an activity sponsored by the school. This is simply absurd to many of these kids, who might already be in two or three activities, being told they have to take another. It would be chaos! I, for one, am a boy scout,Â and I play baseball in the spring and summer. If I was suddenly told that I would have to invest more time into extra curricular activities, many of which i personally have no interest in, I would be furious.

And thats another very big point. Many kids just dont have interest in any school sponsored activities. While a whole bunch of activities expand kids horizons and teach them valuable lessons, what is the point of those lessons if they dont care enough to listen to them in the first place. Whenever I am listening to somebody talk about something I really dont care about,

I forget everything within five minutes. A required activity a kid has no interest in would just end up being dead, wasted time, where the participant would learn nothing of value.

This new policy put forth by the principal, while it may seem like a good thing on the surface, is actually damaging our students. All it is doing is stressing out already stressed students, by requiring them to take another activity they have little to no interest in. Policies like this are just restricting students freedom, and having adults make decisions for kids. At this point in life, its very important to learn how to make decisions and manage their time. With this policy, the principal seems to want to restrict kids decision making power, and put stress where there was none before. All this is doing is worsening the mental health and shift into adulthood of our most valuable asset, our children.
