Dear TEACHER_NAME

I believe that requiring us to have community service is a good idea. One of my reasons for thinking this is a good idea is because its teaching us kids how not just help people in our friends group or at home but reaching out to our community. If kids didn't want to do community service or in better words not help people then we could show them that its not only helping other individuals but its helping ourselves I remember when my brother was in high school and he had to have a certain amount of community service hours one thing he did was help at the salvation army and i remember him coming home and telling my mom and dad thank you for all the things they do for him and buy him and let him do things. At first I didn't really understand what was going on but now that I it changed him, it opened his eyes to a new era i guess you could say it showed him that he doesn't always need to think of himself but he needs to think of other people as well.

Another reason I think community service should be required is because it shows people that younger students care. Whenever I go and stay the night at my Grandmas i always help her clean and do the laundry etc... but what I'm saying is that she likes that i will help her when she needs it, and I have a good attitude about it. I make this statement because what if one of the jobs we do is helping people and we go to an assisted living home we help people there and it shows them that we care for them and that we haven't forgot them.

My last reason is that its getting us ready for the real world. When we grow up we will have to help people in every day situation whether its at our jobs or even at a store we always are helping people and doing things for people if you require us to have community service I believe that it would let people see in a new perspective, so my position on this statement is to require the performance of community service.
