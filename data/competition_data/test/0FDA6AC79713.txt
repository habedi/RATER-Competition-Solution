I bet that if you went around a public school asking kids where they would rather be doing school online or in a school, I bet that the majority of the kids would say they would much rather be doing school like they're now. Why is this, well being a teenager is probably one of the greatest things that can ever happen in your life, we can definitely agree that some of the people that we meet in high school are going to be our friends for a long time and that can sometimes benefit us in the long run, and really the only benefit of being at home for your classes would be being in the comfort of your own home.

Going to school in the morning is probably the worst thing in the world, because I know that when I wake up in the morning I tell myself that I really do not want to go to school, but later on in the day when I wake up it isn't so bad at all. Really I just sit in a classroom and listen to a teacher lecture for an hour and thirty minutes, the only thing that really sucks is how late that we get out because by the time that we get out it's pretty much already dinner time and we still need to do our homework. So being at home throughout your school day would be awesome but you really have the think about the long run, when you grow up you're going to have a job where you work with people, and if you cannot do that then you might get fired. Some more things that can benefit you at a public school could be a library, councilor, and teachers. You don't have an open library when you're home schooled or you don't have school councilors to help you if you have any questions and the real life interaction that you get with your teachers is so much better than having a teacher try to explain you something through a screen. Pretty much the only thing that I would change about my public school is how late we get in and how late we get out, all of the other schools around us get to school around 7:30am and get out around 2:45pm and that would be great because we would be be to get so much more done like homework and projects that you waited last minute for. Getting home at 4:30 in the afternoon sucks I get home and eat dinner right away pretty much and by the time that i'm done with dinner I have to go to practice and that ends at 9:30 don't get home till about 10:30 then that leaves no time for homework.

So in conclusion going to school at a public or private school would be much better than being home schooled, there are just so many more reasons to be going to a public school than being home schooled it's cheaper it has way more things that can support you like friends, and teachers. So I bet that if you still went around asking students where they would of rather been doing school most of them would still say a public school.
