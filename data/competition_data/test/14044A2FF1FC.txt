Dear Principal,

I think that you should allow students to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned of because this way they wont be using them in classes because now they actually have time to use them and most people follow the rules and don't use there phones during school so now they can use them and not get in trouble i think this is a great idea and i think it will work because all every body will do is text or call each other and then when lunch is over they will turn them of and put away.

Another reason is that many people dot have phone so for those people they just get free time and many other people just don't use there phone so it would be a free time for them to. but also there are people who will just sit there and text or call people the whole time. also the teachers will not have to fell like no one is paying attention because now there is no reason to text in class when you have lunch and all free time. so i think this would be a good change if it were to happened.

Also i think that you would see a increase in peoples grades because they will now pay attention more to what the teacher has to say and not what there friends have to say also i think this because many people have good grade now i cant amagin what the grades would be like if people had time in school to use phones.
