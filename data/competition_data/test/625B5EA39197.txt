To whom it may concern,

Over the years students have participating in all kinds of school activities, like: baseball, softball, track and field, and so many more. This letter is representing the fact that students will not be allowed to play sports if they don't have a grade B average. Here are some reasons why they should be allowed: 1, scholarships 2,represent the school 3, have fun. Usually students play sports because they are excellent at it. Some play to get a scholarship for college later on in the future. Scholarships are your ticket to college but some may not think of it that way. Some don't have any idea what they are. You can get scholarships in every sport if you try your hardest. They are so important because if you and your family do not have the money to give to you for college then there is no way you can go, that's why they are so important. My next subject is representing your school. When you play a sport or even in a team you are helping represent your school. Lets say that your on the basketball team and you win the championship and all of your players on the team are excited. You have just represented your school with winning the championship. My last reason for wanting to have school sports is because you can get out with your friends and have a blast. It dose not matter if you are good or bad at the sport, you go out there and have good time. Having fun is what us kids in school like to do , so I think if you take away our sports we wont even want to come to school. To conclude my letter i am very concerned about you taking our sports away. Some of the kids in school that is all they have they might not have a home like you did in school, or for some it is just to get out of the house. The three main concerns again were the following : Scholarships, representing the school , and to have fun. So hopefully after you have read this letter you will think twice about taking sports out of our school.

Your friend,
