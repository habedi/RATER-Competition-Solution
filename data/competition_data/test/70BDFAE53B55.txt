The first reason is because i probabably less challenging to the people the vote reguraly because they can do i on their opinion and nobody elses. This is because how the votes are scored normally is how the people voed and how many they each have this type of voting process works where they have their opinion on what each person thinks instead of just voting. As you can see using this type of voting is a lot easier for people so it not as is as just putting and vote you can use your opinionss as well as voting.

The Second source states that how and why is the Electoral College the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. This is probably because of how much they want this system to work instead of all different types of votes they can just have it all as one as a whole which would make it a whole lot easier on all the people that do vote. Then when they do vote they know how to express why they are voting and how they are voting to see how much easier it i to vote this way. As you can see voing this way could help he cause of opinion could help people and cause people to change their ideas in many different ways.

To end , The Electoral College is alot easier because it helps with easier voting and lets people state things instead of making it complicated you can make it easier and give a good explaination of why and how it makes it easier on the people that will vote with the new Electoral College to make things easier on their part for many reasons.
