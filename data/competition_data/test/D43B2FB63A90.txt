Joining the Seagoing Cowboys group was one of the most greatest accomplishments I have ever made. If you choose to do something in your life, it should be becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. I have some very good points on why you should join.

The first and main reason is this program helps people. It supports people's horses, young cows, and mules, since this program is for those who are struck by natural disasters or for wars that have taken place where they live. It also supports the animals living space. The cowboys must feed and water the animals 2 to 3 times a day, the men have to haul oats and hay from the lower holds of the ship, and they have to clean the animals stalls.

the second reason is that if you turn 18 while on a Seagoing trip and you get drafted, this counts as your service to the military.

The last reason is when you are going to these countries you have these gorgeous and unique places to visit and sightsee. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the streets of Italy from the lake on a gondola ride, and I have even seen the Panama Canal on my way to China.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy then you can experience and support all three of these reasons.
