Luke never expected all of his friends to be in the same carrer that Luke was in. It was a dream come true, luke had always wanted a job that paided good and was awsome to do.

"COME ON!" Shouted Luke. " We are gona be LATE!" Luke had just graduated from high school. He didnt want to go to collage because he didnt have any big carrer plans. Luke was later intuduced to a perfect carrer. His friend wanted to take him to Europe on a "cattle boat" to help people. Luke later discoverd that THIS was the perfect carrer.

17 years old and nothing to do with your life is the worst thing ever. luke had nothing to do with his life untill he went to Europe. Luke discoverd that if you put your mind to anything you can acomplish anything. But Luke had nothing set as a goal for life.

After Luke had gone to Europe 9 times he relized this is his life now. This is what I am ment for. he dicided to go start collage and make his whole life happen. Luke made some new friends along the way to.

This is definetly somthing Luke will remember for the rest of his life. One day he will tell his kids... Yes I went to Europe.
