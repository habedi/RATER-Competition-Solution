I disagree with the principal for making the students to do extra activities in school.

65% of students are not able to do things at school cause of stuff that happen at home.

If kids were forced to do these extra school activities they would always be in a rush,they might not be able to do it,and their grades might decline.

First, the kids will always be in a hurry. For example kids are not the best at time management most kids are really bad at time management and they are kids not grown adults. Also children might panic with to much stress cause there will always be stuff to get done in a short period of time. But at the end of it all their kids and have other things to do.

Secondly, not everyone is able to do school activities. And not all children have a ride if needed to get where needed to. Also some kids get jobs at a early age so they can help out with their living situation and parents. Some kids do sports and can't do the after school activities.

Third of all, students grades might decline. The reason I say that is even with all the extra activities in school they might loose focus. With all that work the kid might be tired. Kids will get nervous and confused trying to figure out how he can do all his work quickly.

At the end it's all about the kids. The kids should not be required to do extra activities andÂ that is what this is about. Also don't force your kid to do something if they dont wanna do it like sports and other things related. But at the end this goes to all the teachers,parents, and staff so lets encourage kids to do what they want and whats best for them.
