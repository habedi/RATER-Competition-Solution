Dear Principle,

I think that needing a B-average to be able to play in sports or other activities isn't fair. I think the minimum grade should be a C-average because a C is still passing and most schools have a policy that requires a C-avergae too.

I think it is a good idea to enforce a minimum grade average to be able to play but I think a C should be fair enough. If you change the policy to needing a minimum B-average then most kids wont be able play or join other activities. Kids earning a C should be able to play/join other sports or activities.

Also maybe before changing the policy, you might want to get opinions from parents and teachers. Getting opinions from these people is great because they know what we, the students, are capable of. Also when you change the policies you not only affect the students but you also affect the teachers, parents, clubs and sports teams.

In conclusion, you should really consider your options about how your going to change the policies because it affects everyone.

Sincerely,
