Dear Principal,

I do think this policy is a good idea. It keeps kids wanting to do better in their classes so they can do the sports they love. Because of sports, some kids think it is okay to be slacking on their work. Just because they have practice or are the stars of their team does not mean they can not worry about school work. Having this policy keeps students on their toes about keeping up their grades and doing well. It also may encourage them to do better. The students that have at least a grade B average know that they can juggle sports and school at the same time. The coaches also have that comfort that the students are not going to fail. Also some activities may require students to be a little smarter. In the long run, students may thank their principal for pushing them to try their best because that might have helped them get into the collage they wanted to go to or get a scholarship. Therefore, I think changing the policy for students to have at least a grade B average is a great idea.
