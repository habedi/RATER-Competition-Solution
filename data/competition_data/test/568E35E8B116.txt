Dear TEACHER_NAME, i am writing you a letter concerning the decision you have made that students can't play sports unless they have a b average ; i really think its not right because some students cant maintain a b average for that reason i say don't do it because if you do then less students will want to play sports and if there aren't many students wanting to be in athletic sports then we won't participate in any other activities like tournaments and i just think our school will be kind of dead like no-one will want to come visit us at all i really wish that you wouldn't do this because it will destroy the whole student body and think of what the consequences are when you do this more kids will be getting in to more trouble and some kids will probably be doing drugs after school some people get in to sports just as a motivation to keep there grades up and passing im not saying every kid is perfect but please give us a chance before you actually decide to do this believe me i know this will work out thanks for you taking time out to read my letter!

sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
