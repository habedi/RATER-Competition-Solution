"If you want it you have to see it with a clear eye view." This is a lyric from Meek Mill's song, Dreams and Nightmares. If students are expected to benefit from a situation and understand the material, they have to be present in the correct environment in order to have a better understanding of the material, which allows them to have a clear eye view. Being in a school setting does not only allow them to have a better understanding of the material, but it also minimizes the possible distractions that learning from home may include. Online classes are not always reliable, the internet can stop working at any time or technical difficulties can occur. Students are more likely to succeed in academic subjects if they're in a school environment which allows them to be fully submerged in their studies, it provides them with skills that may be useful; it gives them the opportunity to create friendships and memories that may impact them for a lifetime.

One's performance and achievement can be heavily impacted by the environment they are in. Students have a better understanding of subjects they're being taught if they're in the adequate learning environment. Students taking online classes can be easily distracted by technological devices that are easily accessible especially in the comfort of their own home. The separation of school life and home life can have a positive impact on a student's life. For example, if a student is having problems at home, they can escape them temporarily by going to school. This allows them to have a mental break which can help improve their overall health and well being. Constantly being at home creates an imbalance by mixing a student's academic focuses with their personal life. They'll end up not dedicating the sufficient amount of time nor attention to either one. Having a designated location for school allows students to better understand the material, it also creates their own space for their personal life.

School is not only a place where one can learn, it is also a place where students can develop multiple skills that will carry on with them throughout their life. For example, being in a typical classroom requires one to perform many tasks such as presenting in front of the class or working with classmates. These tasks allow students to develop social skills, teamwork skills, and communication skills to name a few. On the other hand, students taking online classes may not be able to acquire the amount of skills that students attending school have. These are crucial skills that will help them when they enter the work force, as well as in their everyday life. For instance, individuals that are home schooled may not be as comfortable or used to being around people, which can create difficulties for them when they stop taking classes; due to the fact that many jobs require one to work with others as a team. Which ultimately benefits those who have had prior experiences in those situations.

The memories and friendships one creates in school are carried on throughout one's life. Individuals who attend school have the opportunity to meet and bond with others. They can create memories and experiences that one can only obtain in a school setting. Some examples of this include: school dances, sports games, after school clubs, and assemblies. These are the events that are the most memorable from attending school. Attending a classroom enables students to form relationships with their teachers, which can facilitate the learning process. Taking online classes may keep one from experiencing what makes going to school and learning more enjoyable.

Attending school comes with many memorable experiences, most students who take online classes do not get to experience these memorable events. The environment one is in can greatly affect one's academic performance, which is why school would be the best environment to learn in since it's free of distraction, which cannot be guaranteed from attending online classes from home. The internet is not always reliable, it can go out at any moment which negatively affects a student's learning. Online classes would not be the most ideal when it comes to benefiting a student; learning in a school setting will improve a student's performance, it gives them the opportunity to make friendships and memories, and it allows them to develop crucial skills that they'll always need.
