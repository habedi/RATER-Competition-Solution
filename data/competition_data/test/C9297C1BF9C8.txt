Dear Principal,

I heard you where considering to allow student to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free time, but having them turned off during class. I think that is very wise and good decision. This cell phone policy would give all of us (the students) some freedom. It would allow us to do something entertaining outside of learning during school. First of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. Secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and I think that all the student will understand. Finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission.

First of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. Communicating with our parents or friends is something that as teenagers we normally do. We all have to check our emails, or call or text to. It is a norm of today's society. So why not let us do what everyone else normally does.

Secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and I think that all the student will understand. You give us sometime during the day to use and we will repay by putting it away during class so that we could learn. All the student would put it away because you have relieved our urgency to use it. I know you think we wont but I am sure that once we have time to use, during class it wont be that necessary. Which leads me to my last reason.

Finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission. We wont be getting in trouble for using it during school because we have already had time to use with permission. The number of kids in the CSI room would decline and we wont have as many kids getting in trouble for something that we have had permission to do. Wouldn't you love an CSI room, without a student in trouble to be seen. Well that what that cell phone policy would bring.

In conclusion, if you would let use our cell phones during lunch or free time that would cause a good change in our school. First of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. Secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and I think that all the student will understand. Finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission. Please think about this policy and be the wise man that you are and choose it over the other policy. Remember what i said "a CSI room without a student in trouble to be seen." But you could just change that with one yes to Policy 1. Do the right thing.
