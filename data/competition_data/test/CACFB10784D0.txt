In this passage the author claims many ways and benefits of visiting and exploring our sister planet venus. He claims that venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density, size and it is the closest to Earth in distence. He also claims that even thogh it will be dangerous and difficult to explore venus there are already many scientist trying to figure out ways to make it safe and less of a risk.

The authors claims in this passage does support the idea of studying venus despite the dangers. Through out this passage the author describes how simular venus is to earth.

has a possible solution to the hot temerpatures of Venus. NASA would make it so scientist would be able to float above Venus from a distence. The temperatures would still be around 170 degreed Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be like the sea level on Earth. They would not be the easiest conditions to work in, but a human would be able to survive in these conditions.

In conclusion, the authors claims that the idea of studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is a good idea. The author backs his claim up with many facts such as Venuses simularites to Earth. The authors claims do support his ideas thoughout the passage.
