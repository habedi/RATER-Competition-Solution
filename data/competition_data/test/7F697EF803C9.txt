Some schools today require projects over the summer break to ensure they still remember about the subjects they were taught the previous semester. But should these projects be designed by the student to make the project more enjoyable? Or should they be teacher designed to make sure they meet the criteria needed? Well, students should be given a break during the summer because that is what is is all about and it is a time to relax and enjoy the weather. So I would have to say that students, if required to do the project, should design the summer project. here is why I believe that they should.

Students will be more interested to the project if they got to assign it, because the average student today will most likely forget or just rather enjoy their break. If they were able to design it the way they want to, then they can enjoy project a lot more. There will be some students that still won't do the project, but they were not going to do the project either way weather the student nor' teacher designed the project. But if the student designed the project, then a higher percentage of students will actually do it.

Student designing the project can be a benefit of there own. How can it be a benefit? Well, when the students come together they can explore each others ideas and thoughts about a subject. They can listen to each other and it can be a great way to build on their listing and social skills with the added fact that the can come up with new and brilliant ideas that can be more relevant and unique than a single teacher. Students can also learn more about each other with this exercise and become relatively close with one another.

In lower grade levels such as, second grade to seventh grade, most just get their parents do it. I know about this occurring because in my fourth grade year there were about 32 kids in my classroom, and every project that was assigned to us, every kid had their parents do the project for them. So, kids today havent changed and the project will be irrelevant to them. But if the students make one, then this could limit the project strictly to the student in a way that the parent could not understand the project, therefore unable to do the project for them.

In conclusion, weather the students designed the project or the teacher. Students can have many more benefits than a teacher would. From having a more enjoyable time, to being more effective to the students education. Parents would have to be involved and the student can learn new things without even knowing about it.

I hope this brought a new light to the subject and to influence you to see both sides of the argument.
