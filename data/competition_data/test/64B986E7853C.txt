Dear Principal,

I believe that making all students perform community service is not a good idea because that should be the decision of the student or parent. Students come to school to learn, not to do community service. The time that would be used to perform community service can be used to make sure that students are not confused about any academic topics. This time should be used to give students more advanced lessons that might help them in the future. If students perform community service, they might not be thinking of a having a good future. Students go to school in order to learn academic lessons that will most likely help them in the future, not to do something that people who perform crimes usually do. It is fine a child wants to do community service on their own time, but education should come before any other activity, even though it is an activity that helps the environment. Community service is a great way to help the world around us, but when it comes to a situation like this we need to be a little selfish and think of ourselves before the environment. Students should be trying their best to build a better future for themselves by working hard at school. Parents should make sure that students have their mind focused on their future, and after they make sure of that, it is fine if a student wants to go out and help the people and place around them. Teachers should try to keep students focused on getting a good education. Many students today are doing very poorly in school which is why performing community service will become another distraction that avoid students from performing well in school. As I mentioned before, education comes first. All children deserve to have a good education and a bright future which is why we should not allow any child to be distracted by any other activity.

Sincerely,
