The introduction of article is Venus an twin planet of Earth terms of density and size and it also called evening star because it the one brightest points of light during night sky. Venus is the second planet from our sun and humans spends numerous of spacecraft to land on venus. Each one the mission was failture and the Venus was more challegeing to land on.

Venus is planets that human want to visit but it seem impossible because of cloud- drapped. The planet atomsphere almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and even more challegeing part is cloud are high corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atomsphere. The plant's surface temperatues is average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and venus has the hottest plant in our solar system, venus weather present of erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes seeking to the land of surface. The scienctists wanna to explore venus becuase the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and long ago, we discover that Venus covered largely with oceans and could be various forms of life in Venus. The planet has simlair surface rocky, velleys, mountains, and craters like earth does and even more venus is our closet option to visit the plantary. The Nation Aeronautics and Space Administration idea plan to sending human to study Venus and possible soultion of Venus surface to allow the scienctists float above the fray also predicting blimp- like vehicle to hovering above the roiling venusian landscape and scientists want their plan to successful. Another thing when they plan to visit Venus, they use jet airplanes to travel at higher altitude and fly over the many storms and to stay away from unfriendly condition surface. The NASA doing Important research to get sample of rock, gas or other important things from the distance from surface of Venus.

The conclusion of Venus is NASA figuring away to study Venus rather then going on surface to risk life. NASA working on elecronics that is made of Silicon Carbide to help NASA study of Venus planet. A long ago NASA used old technology called meachanical computer and the first devices that played important role in 1940s during World War ll. It seem shocking that their was technology that can be used as calculations. The Modern comtper were powerful used for extreme physical codnditon and the challege is Venus has Value and humans can do the mission but the NASA wouldn't put human to danger.
