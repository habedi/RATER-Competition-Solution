DEAR, STATE SENATOR

We should keep the electoral college because we want the people to vote not the house. If the people dont vote how would we know if we are getting what we deserve. Also as the artcle states "the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president". The people should be able to vote because if we dont we are not going to be happy that we didnt get a say in the election.

The article states the that the eletoral college consist of 538 electors but only a majority of 270 electoral votes is required. Where is the 300 hundred and somthing other votes do they not get counted or do you forget about them because i think that is unreasonable becaues we have more people voting. The article states that "most states have a "winner takes all" i think that this is basically cheating because you should only get what you have. If you get more than what you elected for the other people that you get will possiably turn against you thats why you should only get the people you already have.

If we let the people votes for who they may want then we would also be helping out the house to deside on who is president. For the people that like politics would like to vote but yes i know that some people arent going to vote,but we should still give are people a chace to vote. in this case i would like to have the electoral college to stay but let the people speak too.

this is why i would likw to keep the electoral college.
