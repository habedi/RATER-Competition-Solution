Dear TEACHER_NAME, community service for middle school children is a very controversial issue some people say you should require it some say you shouldn't. You shouldn't require the kids of SCHOOL_NAME to do community service. In SCHOOL_NAME they will have to do community service anyways so why not let them have more time to do activities and projects with their parents and friends now. Community service is a great way to keep kids occupied and out of trouble. However the kids of SCHOOL_NAME don't get in trouble very much so this is not required. you could issue it as a punishment to kids that misbehave repetitively to keep them out of trouble. One may argue that community service is good for the kids. However they will have to do thirty hours of community service to graduate SCHOOL_NAME so they will be getting this experience in SCHOOL_NAME. One may argue that it would be good exercise to have kids cleaning up the town. However do you really want little fifth graders roaming around where they could be offered a ride home by a man in a white van and never seen again. This is the problem with younger kids cleaning up the town but if it was a High School student than they would be a lot smarter about what to do in situations like this. So TEACHER_NAME when deciding whether to have your Middle School kids say nay to requiring them to do community service. Save them from possibly being kidnapped.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
