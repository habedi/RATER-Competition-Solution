Dear, Principle

I'm going to write this letter for you so you could at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. I understand why you want to change policy but all the kids at least wants to participate in a sport that they realy liked and been dreeming that they will play that sport trough college and wants to have a career that they realy want and like it a lot and they want to start in middle school to practice and have more experience playing different kind of people and teams.

and they want people and their family cheering for them. What about band too. A lot people have dream to play their favorite instrument. They want people to hear him or her playing that beautiful sound that comes out of that instrument. How about dance class theirs a lot of people that sins little kids they have been dancing and they have dream that they would be in a lot of copetitions they could even come out on movies and be a star and be like wow if the principle wouldn't let me that teacher that knows how to teach dance i'll wouldn't ever make it to be a profecional dancer. Some day i'll will go give her tanks for everything and give her a big basket of mufins that she loves. All that i wanted to tell you principal that you regreet that chance that you gave to us. And for us to live are dreams and have any sport or other activities at least a grade B average and you will hear wonderful things happen only with that chance you gave every single kid from this school.
