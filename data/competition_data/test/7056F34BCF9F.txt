In the article " The Challenging of Explore Venus" it is about the author suggesting the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is the brightest point of light in the night sky which is a challenging place to examine more closely, it explains how they sent numerous spacecraft which none survived the landing for more than a few hours " Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades" (para 2)the author is explaining how its been so long that no one has touched down on Venus or survived the landing which makes it a challenging planet for humans to study. It has a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide which blankets Venus " Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrisive sulfruroc acid in the atmosphere. On planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmpospheric pressure 90 times greater" (Para 3) this means Venus has the hottest surface temperature from any planet in the solar system it has weather like Erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and lightning strikes to probes going on the land on its surface. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to knowledge Venus, " Nasa is working on other approaches to studying Venus" this means Nasa is finding better ways to make their technology last longer and be resistant to Venus and its weather condtions. Therefore, the author has good explanation why its challenging the idea to study Venus with its worthy pursuit of dangers.
