My opinion on the driverless car is a big two thumbs up, I think these cars are a big stepping stone in the world of technology, letting us advance to create more useful creations to help our daily lives. Driverless cars can help evolve our future, at least our future in technology, and help us create more wonderful inventions. The best part is the cars that Sergey Brin sees in the future will not even use as much fuel that we use today, it will only require half that amount.

I believe it to be very fascinating that for a car to be smarter it will need many sensors all over it. This way the car would be able to copy a human's skill at the wheel. The sensors attached to the car will allow it to apply brakes whenever danger is coming up ahead. We are unfortunately very lucky to have that ability to attach sensors onto the car to provide it the intelligence of driving on it's own, since back then we never had any sensors, computers, or mapping made by google.

Recapping my opinon on these driverless cars, I would like to say that they are great to have for transporting people who can't drive and delivering packages or whatever else they need to be used for. One more thing about having driverless cars is that it's useful for parent's, while the car drives to their destination, they will be able to take care of their children without having to stop the car. Lastly, I would like to sum it up and say that driverless cars coming to the future will have everyone is shock, especially by how amazing we have advanced in time.
