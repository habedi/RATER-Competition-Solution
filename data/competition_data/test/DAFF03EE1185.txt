Being stuck in school wasting time is one of the biggest tortures a student faces. How can teachers teach when they're talking to faces looking down at florescent screens with Airpods in their ears? The best way to reach them is by using technology, which is more interactive and entertaining for the students; phones aren't the distraction, it's the lack of interest. In order to provide a better education, teachers should adapt to a new method of teaching: virtual classrooms. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because distance learning provides more opportunities to those who are unable to get to school and in order to enhance learning environments, allowing personalized educations that provide better opportunities to all students.

Usually, snow days are a time for excitement and fun for students, but high-schoolers would probably spend too much time worrying about what they are missing in class. Ever since the introduction of Google Classroom, students have been able to keep better track of their assignments and not fall behind in their educations .

Last year, a huge snowstorm caused my school to be canceled for two weeks, but it wasn't as enjoyable as it sounds. Too much of my time was spent worrying about what assignments are due, what quizzes I have to prepare for, and how I would be able to finish all of my work in time. Luckily, I was able to use Google Classroom in order to see my late work and ask my teachers questions on what I was confused on. Emailing my teacher Generic_Name is very different than being able to have online classes with her, as it allows for more connection and a stronger understanding of the subject. When having a video conference, she can answer my questions in depth when I would otherwise be lost without answers. Not all of the class I take are available in my school, and virtual classrooms allow me to access more opportunities for education. Distance learning allows students to have access to an education if they are prevented from reaching it in physical schools.

Some people believe that a traditional learning environment is the best way to provide an education, because this style allows the best of the best to flourish. In the book

Outliers , one could argue that by having a specific place to learn, it would separate those who had the motivational drive to continue on and those that would settle for less. Those who went above and beyond would have access to more education in order to provide different levels of learning, allowing the smartest to receive the most education while not wasting 'unnecessary'Â supplies on people who wouldn't put their skills to use. The problem is that motivation is an external influence, and different levels of interest doesn't mean that those students would be less successful or deserve less help. With many new styles and methods of learning, along with more support systems in order to allow students to succeed in their classes, students are able to find a method of teaching that best suits them and allows them to become successful. A major reason that students are uninterested in learning is because of the pressure put on them and the lack of interesting topics to learn. By having virtual classrooms, students would be able to freely explore and develop their own education path that would have previously been inaccessible.

Not everyone has the same opportunities to learn, and distance learning is able to bridge those gaps and allow more people to have access to an education. In the book

Educated , none of the family had a formal education, as none of the children were able to attend a public school and the parents never finished high school. By having a digital classroom, they would have been able to pass the GED or SAT in order to move out of their parent's house and live their own life. The oldest brother had a learning disability, and wasn't able to find any work because of his lack of education. If he was to have an online tutor or teacher, he would have access to more suitable environment to continue to learning while getting the help he needs. Along with providing additional help in school, a virtual learning environment also introduces students to new cultures and people that they would otherwise not have been exposed to, thus enriching their lives. Attending online classes allows students to have access to a better education and introduce them to a world of possibilities.

Giving students the possibility to reach their full potential should be the goal of every teacher. By having students attend online classes, they are able to gain a stronger education that what they were able to previously access. Virtual educations are the path of the future, allowing easier accessibility, diverse learning opportunities, and additional help to all students.
