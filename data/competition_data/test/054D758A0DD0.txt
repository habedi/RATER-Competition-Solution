Students do not always agree with teachers when it comes to projects. Some schools assign summer projects. These can either be designed by the teachers or the students. There are those who argue that teachers should be the ones to design the projects. Although some may disagree, it is easier to just allow the students to design the projects themselves.

Student made projects can be very beneficial to teachers. First off, teachers will be able to learn more about their students. If the project is something more personal it could reveal something the teacher did not know about the student. For example, doing a project on an inspirational person will give the teacher a better idea of the student's interests. Secondly, teachers will not always have the best ideas for projects. The result of this could be a project that is easy to grade but a hassle for the student making it. Imagine having to write a monologue, it is very easy to critic; however, it is both a difficult assignment to script, as well as present. Finally, an assignment another student created could inspire a future student to try new things and give them fresh ideas for their projects. Assignments such as these are often kept by teachers, if they are good enough to present to future students as an example of what they could do. An example showing a project through a flashy presentation program like Prezi could draw a student's attention away from a boring poster.

If students were allowed to design their own projects, they would have greater freedom when developing ideas for their projects.

For starters, students will be much more motivated to work on a topic that interests them. Someone who likes action and crime would not be drawn to a project on a book like

Pride and Prejudice.

Also, students will get to experiment with new methods of presentation for their projects. Someone who invested a great amount of time and effort into their project will not want to present their work in a dull manner. A poster will not do justice to a project someone invested a lot of their time into; however, the student could try new PowerPoints or even make a video with fellow students in order to up the presentation. Finally, projects produced by students will be of both higher quality and variety than a uniform teacher's project. If the students are willing to put time in and really work hard on their projects then no two projects will be the same. These projects will all have different: methods of presentation, key points, evidence for claims, and the main idea will vary as a whole as well making the possibilities as great as the imagination of the students.

Although some may disagree, it is easier to just allow students to design the projects themselves. This method will benefit both the students and the teachers. Teachers will learn more about their students and will not have to design the projects. Students will be more free to use the methods they wish when making the project and will have the option to do the project on a topic they feel is worth expressing themselves for. Even future students will benefit if the teachers choose to keep the projects as examples. There are those who argue that teachers should design projects; however, it is better to just leave it to the students. No student wants to work on, let alone present a project which they have no interest in, so they should be free to guide themselves in whatever way they see fit.
