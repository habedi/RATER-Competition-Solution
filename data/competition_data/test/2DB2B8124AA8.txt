DEAR Principal ,

I think that policy 1 that student can bring cell phone to school because you do think that bring cell phones is not important but it's good idea that they for allow in the schools .

For example is policy 2 said that not to bring cell phone want will happened with student have if is some big is happened in school and that you can't cell your parent and they think that some big is bad in the school .The policy 2 is not fair students have a chose to bring the cell phones to school and that the policy 1 be the one and fair to all students and that it will not cause trouble with anyone and that they . My point is that the use of the cell phones maybe of use but if the student use the cell phones in the free time that they can use it like lunch or in a place that can't see you use it but in the class the cell phones can be off or on vibrate so can't hear it when people are take to you.

So the best chose is policy 1 that all student can bring cell phones to school and that the best way to and fair to other people . That is the to think the best chose.
