Summer is the longest break students get. Every kid loves the hot summers and playing outside. The only downside to summer is the fact that most kids forget a lot of what they learned throughout the school year. Majority of kids are more focused on having a fun summer than they are on retaining their knowledge, which is why summer projects were created. Although, some students take no breaks from their education, teachers should be the ones designing the students' summer projects so those children can continue learning during break.

A protruding factor that supports the position that teachers should plan the summer projects for students is that the teachers are the masters of what they are teaching. Teachers go to school to study and learn about the subject they are teaching so they know more about it than the students do. For example, a teacher goes to school for four years to study physics and teaching. Then, they go on to teach that subject to students. Since they have a degree in those areas of studies that proves their credibility to them knowing what they are doing. While some students may be well educated on a subject, a teacher has a degree, which shows they hold superior knowledge and really know how to get a student to learn a subject the right way. Therefore, teacher's should design student summer projects.

Another prime point to key in on is the fact that teachers are more experienced than the students by a large margin. Most teacher's have been educators for years, and even if they have not, they have been in the field for years. Becoming a teacher is something that takes time. What has to be kept in mind is that they once were students too, so they know what is best to do or give to help their students continue learning. My aunt, for example, studied mathematics for four years in college and is now a math teacher at a high school nearby. She knows what is best to do for her students to learn because she once had to learn it all too. Although students have experience in the learning field, teachers are more experienced and know what is the best way to design a project for students to continue learning even through breaks.

One under minded factor that should be considered when determining whether teachers should design the summer project is the level of maturity teachers hold compared to students. Teachers are much older than their students, as a result, they are more experienced in the world, which makes them more mature. For example, if I were given the opportunity to make my own summer project, I would make it as short and easy as possible. This shows my immaturity as a kid because i want to spend as little time learning in the summer as possible and use the rest of that time to have fun. My math teacher on the other hand, realizes that summer is long and if the students do not do any math over the summer, then they will forget a lot. To prevent that, she gives out lengthy math packets so her students can continue learning. This shows her maturity in her realization of how important it is for a student to continue learning even through breaks. While some students may be mature, teachers are more mature than the majority of their students. Thus, teachers should be given the responsibility of designing summer projects.

Even though some students are serious learners day in and day out, teachers should be the ones planning out the summer projects for students. Children are focused more on having fun than they are on furthering their education during any break. Summer is no exception, for some it is a resting time, but for most it is an opportunity to slack off on their education. Teachers know how to keep the kids learning, nevertheless, the teachers should do the teaching and the students should do the learning.
