Texting and driving is just like drinking and driving it's very dangerous.Everyday it's a car accident most of the time it's because somebody is texting and driving.Some drivers can text and drive without being in a car accident but it's still not safe for the people who were in the car with and the people on the road.It's all ages texting and driving not just teens and not just adults.
