Are driverless cars preparing us for good, or are they setting us up for failure? In my opinion driverless carsarent driverless cars. But they are a big part in our car building safety programs.

Lets think, if we didnt have driverless cars were we would we learn the safety of our vehicles in situations such as accidents, car fires and things in that category. I know every show that I have seen, that has to do with driverless cars has proved a big point, and I have learned something I needed to about car safety. But completly driverless cars are a problem. we cant have a car without at least one human looking over it to make sure it stops doing something that it doesnt need to at a reliable time. All the driverless cars we have today in age are fine, they work by technology and men but neither one by it's self. Driverless cars are a team thing between technology and men, we have to work togther for it all to work properly. Yea there will be mistakes in driverless car situations but remeber no one is perfect, we have to learn somewhere. we know there expensive, and they are risky but its really worth it.
