Attending classes at home, or by video conference is very beneficial. Students are more likely to pass their classes, or become more independent. Students would be more likely to enjoy staying at home and doing their work there. That way they can wake up at the time they want, so they're not sleeping in class. I am one of those kids that sleeps in class if I'm too tired. Sleeping in class has caused my grades to go down, since I'm not paying attention.

Students would benefit in many ways, for example: they can take the class at their own rate. In my math class, we finish a lesson in 2 days, then we take the test, meanwhile I'm still trying to take in what we just learned. If students could take their classes online, they would be able to get in all the information that is needed in order to pass. Students wouldn't be stressing about taking a test on information they don't know about. The worst part is not having enough time to study. Online testing would make it much easier to prepare.

Another way of benefiting would be, students wouldn't be missing class. Often time students miss school to go on vacation, which causes their grades to drop. Since classes would be online, the student could take their class with them. I have a friend, Generic_Name, she moved to Costa Rica with her family, but she is taking online classes. Although she is far away, Generic_Name is still getting her education. The only time she comes to Generic_School, is when she has to take an SOL.

People may ask, "what about visual learners?" Well, there is an option for video conferencing. Which means, that you can talk to a person, through video chat, to get further explanation. Another option would be looking up videos, YouTube has many channels that teach different subjects. I look up YouTube videos for Chemistry all the time, they show how to solve a problem step-by-step. While visual learners may be concerned, the're many options to help those that need it.

Many schools offer school online, which many students have benefited from. Generic_Name's best friend, Generic_Name, also started online school and finished it. She got good grades, and is now having an amazing life with her family. She is not worried or stressed about school. Online school would benefit many kids, like those who are diagnosed with cancer. They can't come to school due to their treatment, but if their school offers online classes, then they can take them. They wouldn't fall behind in school. Overall, schools should have the option to take online classes.
