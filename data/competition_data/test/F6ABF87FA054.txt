Dear Principal,

As you may know, there is a conflict involving whether students in our school should do community service or not. After taking my time, thinking about this conflict, I had come up with a solution. In my opinion, children of my age should be doing community service regularly because they can help the community, they spend more time outside rather than inside and it builds their character.

In modern days, the environment is very unclean. There is trash all over the place and there are people in the world who just do not appreciate the environment. People are littering and there is a big mess just about everywhere an average person walks. If we use their time to clean up these areas, the community would be much cleaner.

Some students are the indolent kinds and they do not do anything but lay down on their couch and play video games or watch television. But if these students do community service then they are more active whether its helping a teacher or cleaning a school yard.

When somebody does something to help someone, the will most likely will feel proud of themselves. That is when they build a better character. They build a larger self-confidence, self-esteem, and a better person within themselves.

When i walk outside, by myself, I always ask myself, what is a good way to make the world a better place, then i thought about community service, a light bulb struck my head. We, the student body, strive for a better community, we should make ourselves do community service for the good of mankind. I hope you consider my recommendations of community service.
