Did you know venus surface,tempertures average over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is ninety times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

The author supports the idea that studying the planet venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because earth should not be limited by the dangers of exploring and expanding the human eye.

As the curiosity of the human's eye wanting to figure out what new discoverys they can go to and end up in.

The authors explanation of trying to make this challenge a reality and striving to see whats on the other side because human curiosity will likely lead us into many other explorations that are imagination can hold.

In paragraph 7 they talk about how using old technolgy that was being used in World war two would be better to discover venus than using are previous technolgy because the shocking part about old technology was that they make calculations by using gears and levers and would not require any electricity. They also state that even if modern computars are enormously powerful,flexable,and quick they can not with stand the physical conditions of venus. Explaining the authors idea of them wanting to discover and expand their curosity and many more adventures that it can lead too.

The authors idea is explained threw out the article how astronomers and pioneers should continue to explore and continue to strive on thinking what's on the other side. As they show and represent that they are using there old technolgy to try to reach the impossable to make it possable but also using venus as a place if needed to be used as a nearest option for a planetary visit. This is what striving and hunger of human curiosity can lead us too an could lead human's to many more adventures.
