The principal wants to change school policy so that if we don't get a B average we cant play sports. But most people have more of a C average, we all aren't honor students, we get a C once and a while. that would be unfair if all of us got penalized for getting a C average, it is still passing. it would be more fair to have at least a C average to participate.

A lot of kids use school sports to get away from home and to relax and have fun, i for sure have fun in marching band which is technically a sport i could get penalized for if i have a C average, I actually do have a C average, So i wouldn't be allowed to get out socialize and have fun with people who share the same interests as me? With your policy no i wouldn't. I think you need to give us kids a break and let us have fun, I do realize we don't necessarily make your job a walk in the park either. But maybe we would give you a break.

We love our activities, Some of us play basketball. And some of us are in band, But those activities teach us life lessons and maybe even giving us the ideas to be something more than we thought we wanted to be. We could go to basketball practice and realize we want to pursue in playing basketball for a living or even as a coach. We could go to marching band and realize that we want to be a musician or a band director. And if u deprive us from those discoveries just because we got a C average, I don't know what kind of a principal you would be, But my guess is not a great one.

So if i could help you make this decision i would, But then again its your decision, but i would hope this helped. Think of this letter when your signing your policy papers, Think you could deprive us from discovering a unknown talent. we shouldn't be deprived just because we got a C, If i got a D it would change the story, But for now think about it.
