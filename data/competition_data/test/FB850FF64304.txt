Cell phones while driving

Cell phones while driving is one of the biggest issues that we have today. Everyone has a cell phone so more than likely it's in there hand 24/7, When it goes off while they are driving they automatically think that they have to check it right then and there no matter if it is a message, social media, or even a phone call. Cell phones while driving should be stopped for the safety of the people on the roads and even your own life. No matter if you can drive and be on the phone, think of the others that you are putting in danger.

When you get notifications you have to look down for quite some time, It is dangerous to type and read while on the road so why put yourself and others life at risk. While you are reading or even texting you are putting all of your thought into the conversation that you are not focused on the road. You could be texting or looking at your phone and slowly losing control of the car which could easily cause a car crash that you could have avoided just by paying attention to the road.

Making phone calls while driving are dangerous as well. I understand that you could be busy and have important calls coming in or even going out, but they can truly wait until you come to a stop or even make it to your destination. There should be absolutely no reason to pick up or even have your phone in your hand whatsoever. If the call is really important then you can pull over from where you are and answer the phone at least try to think about others on the road

A call or even a text can wait until you get to where you are going, ,cell phones should not be allowed while you are driving. Be aware of everyone's safety not just yours. Think of all the things that I just said and take them into consideration. Others may say that being on the phone while driving is not bad if you know what you are doing but why take a risk at something that you can avoid.
