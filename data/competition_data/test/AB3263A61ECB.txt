Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do not understand the fact that you want to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

In this letter it explains reasons why I think that your new school policy is unfair.

I feel this is completely unfair because most students in the school have an C average which is very close to a B average. This is also unfair because even though the students are not a B average student they are still passing their classes. They should be able to participate in any school functions because they have worked hard for the work that they have shown thus far.

I think you should change the school policy so that any students that are on the exclusion list can not participate in any sports or any school/ after school functions. I think this is a good idea because if a student is terribly bad but get good grades how would you allow this student to participate in any school functions or even leave out of the school building for trips ? I also think this is a valid point because they must have did something bad to be put on the exclusion list. In my opinion I think that these are very good reasons.

I hope that after you read this letter you would understand the importance of why I think your new school policy is very unfair or disliked. I also hope that i have convinced you to change the school policy to a very good school policy, as the one i have included in this letter. If you have any questions, comments , or concerns feel free to send me a letter back.

P.S. I am looking forward to a change in the new school policy.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
