Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Getting students involved in community service is a great idea! By doing this students will have the opportunity to help people in need, help the environment and feel good about doing things for their city. I think all student should be required to do at least 10 hours of community service each year and in this letter I will convince you of that!

By students performing community service it gives them the opportunity to have fun by helping the environment. For example, if all the students from each grade got together and went somewhere in their community and planted trees, that would be a great learning experience for the students and teaching them about how global warming is effecting our planet would be a great way for the teachers to encourage the children to do more with helping the environment.

Next, by children performing more community service it gives them the chance to help others. For example, students could go on a field trip to a local nursing home or a homeless shelter and sing Christmas carols to the residents around Christmas time. I would have loved to have done something like that in school but it was never required that we do community service so it was not done. Also by doing this, the residents would enjoy it and would talk highly about the school.

Finally, by children performing more community service students might feel good about themselves for helping others and the environment. Who could not feel good about helping others and making a difference? By feeling good about themselves students' self esteem level will increase and they will always remember what they did to help someone else and help the environment.

I hope my reasons and examples have convinced you to require all students here at SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service. I think helping save the environment and helping others are so important for young students to do so that whenever they are older they will also wish to do community service. Please take my request into consideration, the world will thank you!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
