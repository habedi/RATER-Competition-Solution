Dear Principle,

I strongly agree that students should take charge and start making a difference in their life! You should make it required for students to perform community service and help out the people in need of a helping hand.

Now days many kids don't realize how fortunate they are to have a roof over their heads and food to eat! They don't realize that there are people out there who are struggling just to bring food home to their loved ones! These kids think that sitting on the couch playing video games is important. Well look at those kids who can't afford these gaming systems. Instead of playing, they're out their working their butts off at age 7! If those kids can get off their butts and start working, the people who just sit on their butts all day can take some time off and help those people. One hour won't hurt you; there's a whole other day for you to catch up on things.

Helping people makes you feel good on the inside. Just knowing that you did a good deed for someone in need warms your heart because you know they appreciated every second of it. If your smart and good at teaching someone, go help out the younger kids who need help on their homework. You can tutor little kids after school or pick up litter on the schools campus. These little things that students can do will make a huge difference on the way we look at life today. The students who are doing community service deserve a round of applause for giving up their time and putting in all their effort to start making a difference in this world. They are the ones who are going to be ruling this world in the future and making this world a better place.

Doing community service also looks good on college applications. If they found out how many times you've done community service they will always think twice about your application. This may get more students into college to start a career and get on move on with their life.

It's not only about feeling good about yourself, but making others feel good that you were there when they needed a helping hand. For these reasons, I agree that you should make it required for students to perform community service.
