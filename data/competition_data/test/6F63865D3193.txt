I am totally against driverless cars. It seems like a waste of our resources. Creating driverless cars can waste a lot of money too. The car isn't completely driverless , some help is still required. You'll also need to create new roads , so the car can pick up on the signals.

Creating driverless cars can waste a lot of money. Everything a car has now you'll need triple that amount. In the passage it states "they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply to expensive to be practical." Its so much that would have to go with those driverless cars. Plus cars like that the average person wont be able to afford it.

As stated before those cars aren't completely driverless. In the passage it states "they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues." Its things the driver has to do to key the car in the right direction. I don't believe that their would be a time where a car is completely driverless.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars are not safe. People should just stick to regualr normal driving cars. Getting a driverless car is just a form of being lazy.
