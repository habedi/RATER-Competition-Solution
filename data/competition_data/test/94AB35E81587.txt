Dear Principal,

I think that community service is a great thing. Some people love to do it and others, not so much. Depending on what your job is; it can be complex or easy. People have different opinions on this, but I think that there should be a certain amount of time needed each day for community service. Doing a community service job each day means commitment, time management, and focus. Doing these jobs builds character, adds to your job application, and helps with your social/emotional and physical feelings.

Like I said, not everybody likes community service. But doing it can help make you a better person. Doing a job for your community will help make it a better place and a happier place. For example, if your community has a lot of trash, and you pick it up, it now looks nicer and more well kept. This can give you a good feeling and a good relationship to you and your neighbors. If people did things like this every day, this world could completely change for the better.

I said that community service can help your job application. The cool thing is it can! Having jobs, even community service, can look great on a resume. It can lead to opening doors for other, better jobs. For example, if you wanted to join a job and it was between you and another guy, but you had community service for a previous work place/job, and he had nothing, who do you think would get the job? You! Even a small thing like community service can lead to great things in life.

Doing community service can help build character. But on top of that, it helps build emotional and physical strength. Doing community service helps with emotional strength, because you can meet new people as friends, and you can talk to people about things you like to do. Did you know, that emotional strength helps keep you at your highest for physical strength? So just being happier with new friends could make you feel a bit better physically!

So, overall, I'm saying one thing. YES! There should be a required amount of time for community service in our schools. Please take this into consideration, because I'm challenging you (Mr./Mrs. Principal) to have us students make this earth we live on a better place. Community service, is just one way we can help.
