Many people know what a car can do but do they know how it can affect the environment. Places like Germany or Paris are having a car free environment. Cars release carbon and that gets struck in the atmosphere and can cause environmental damage. With the limiting of car usage, fatcors likeÂ environmental damage will decrease.

First of all, a suburb area in Germany have ban cars. Vauban, Germany have given up on their cars. People there doesn't have the need to drive a car. That means the stores are in walkable distant. Studied from David Goldberg stated that "the official Transportation for America are now less dependent on cars." The reason to that isEnvironmantal Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communities.

Going on, Paris had enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city since Paris is near the record for pollution. The way Paris enforce the rule is by placing a fine on the people who drives on that day with a 22-euro($31). About 4000 driver was fined due the banning of driving. With that done the percent of air pollution drop a rewarding percent. The event was so successful to clear the smog, Paris decide to rescind the banning.

Lastly, some study show that the era for car are nearly end. "In the year 2005 United States reached the peak for the number of miles driven.", according to analysis Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. After that the number of miles driven have drop nine percent in 2013. This have a beneficial affect on the carbon emissons that si released into the environment.

This can help people around the world know the whats happening and think about driving cars. The decrease in the carbon release by cars in the atomosphere can all saved the environment.
