I think my principle should let the students have a c average to participate in school activities. Here's why, not many students can average a b and above. Many can average c and above.

With people averaging a B and above there wouldn't be many people that could do sports. Most kids have a C. A c is okay to have. It's not failing. It's passing. There would be many more people if you let them have a C. It may even make the team better. I think they should everyone who's passing there school work do sports. it would almost be like a reward for passing. They definitely shouldn't be able to participate if lower grades.

It would be like an accomplishment to be on a team. It's also a very good way to keep your grades up. I think that should keep it at a c average and above to be on a sports team, no B and above. That's almost not fair.
