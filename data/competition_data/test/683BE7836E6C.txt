Cars have been by all means the number one way of  transportation in the last decade and now people are starting to prefer walking or biking instead of driving everywhere. One of the reasons is pollution people all around the world are scared of the greenhouse effect but peole are moslty looking at the advantages in not driving If we dont drive the earth will be less polluted in the united states the number two cause in pollution is cars if we cut our driving in half we would be making our earth less polluted and more clean and also saving our ozone layer another reason that not driving isnt such a nad thing is you dont have to deal with the gas money everyone spends on there car well if you want to drive you have to put gas in it so it can go and sometimes the gas prices can be up there an if i gave my estimate i think people spend close 20,000 dollars in gas if your driving in your community of course im not talking about every person in the world just giving an estimate and that is alot of money if you save that much money in about 4 years you have your self a house or an apratment its a big difference spending all that money on gas then saving up for something you really want like a house apartment etc something else you dont have to deal with is the traffic that cars cause on the higway and sometimes in the community i know we all have been stuck in a horrible traffic jam and you cant do anything about it and we all think if only we could just walk ny everybody well the people that arnet driving and they are on the sidewalk yeah they can walk past it or they dont have to deal with the traffic jam another reason is a the accidents sometimes can be fatal to life and your checkbook and insurance now a days is through the roof another thing you have to worry about paying when your dealing with a car accidents take alot of lives every year i read a stat that every second there are  three acidents i mean i dont know if its true but if it is that is flat out scary of course you never think it will happen to you but even the best drivers crash and when it does happen either your life is in danger or checkbook is thats another thing walkers and bikers dont have to worry about crashing and either being seriously injured or coughing thousnads of dollars of expensies or damages also have to worry about keeping your car in the shop every time you need an oil change or your tires are flat or transmisson isnt working right there can be a millon problems with your car and that all cost money waling to your destantion doesnt cost a cent and if your the person that likes to save every cent why throw it away when you throwing thousands and thousands of dollars every year on something youn quite francally dont need in your life if your destnation is to walk take the bus close enough so you can walk there that way you will be saving so much money that you'l be amazed at the end of the year when you have way  more money than you had last year your going to look back and say wow i should never got a car so always keep in mind the next time you step  in your car the worries you deal with every time you drive remember ypu have to fill up or your not going any where and always going to hurt your checkbook espiacally if your car gets 10 per a gallon another thing is  the scare of the accident always looming in the dark you never know when you'll have but almost everyone is doomed to have one and those can be fatal to your body or checkbook and insureance for when it does happen is not pretty also those traffic jams are horrible and when you say aabout 50 peole all past you on the side walk and your stuck in that massive traffic jam you'll remeber this essay and say wow i should of been on that side walk and the last advantge you should know about is that while your not driving your not hurting everyones earth world air space etc your helping the earth get cleaner everytime you decide to walk instead pump up your gas tank and let off polluted gas off into the air and ulitamelty deplete the ozone i know that people will still be driving because again like i said its the number one way of transportation but the goal should be to atleast cut the driving rate in half that would help the earth in a major way and of course you would be alot richer by the end of the year so all that walking you did over the year you can rechoice over a nice vaction to the bahmamas or hawaii oe even buy yourself a nice house so you can see that dropping your car should of been a decison you did years ago and the earth will be a better place without your car driving around the streets so the next time your friend asks to come over just walk or the next time you need to just go get the groroices you can walk and one by one peole will stop driving and start helping making the earth a better cleaner safer place so you be the first one to drop driving and start walking and people will follow imsure of it and even if you have to explain the benfits so beit just know by doing those things you will acheive the goal of making the earth a better place without pollution and more ozone layer to protect from the dangerous uv light if you want a better future for your kid or grandchild its just not your earth your hurting its everybody else's including your loved ones all that money your spending buy your loved ones a gift.
