Dear Principal,

I really appreciate all that you have done for our wonderful school. I have learned that you are considering a new cell phone policy for our school. I highly believe that you should consider Policy 1, which allows us students to bring our cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as our phones are turned off during class time.

One reason I believe you should make this our school policy is that sometimes we have an emergency and need to call home. I understand that we can ask permission and call home from a school phone, but sometimes it is about something personal and we are embarrassed to be talking in front of other people about it. We should be able to talk in private, if we need to, to our parents or guardians.

I realize this could be a problem because if other schools do not have this same policy, then kids at this school could be tempted to call or text their friends from other schools. That would be something that would be hard to control but if they really wanted to keep this policy going they would obey the rules. If the other schools do not complain about kids at that school having their cell phones out too much after we switched our policy than you will have to switch it back.

In conclusion, I hope you really consider Policy 1. It would make many of us happy and we would really benefit some of us. Thank you for taking your time in reading my letter and I will be waiting to hear your response.

Sincerely,
