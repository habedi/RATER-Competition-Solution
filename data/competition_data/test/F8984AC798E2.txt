Dear, Principle,

I believe that students should be required to do community service.

Some of us my like cleaning, and might not.

PROPER_NAME can tutor.

She could tutor children in History.

Because she is good at History.

If you made her a History tutor, people might think that child's a genius.

PROPER_NAME will help old people across the street, but she won't clean. Sorry, PROPER_NAME likes to go shopping instead of cleaning.

She will on her own time help children with math (she's also my tutor).

She on the yearbook staff, president of the chess club, and editor of the school paper.

She tries to have the time to do community service.

Now you can make PROPER_NAME, and his gang clean up some of the litter they throw on the ground.

Make them go out there and clean up so those who do community service don't have to clean up after them.

All they do is skateboard.

They should learn something from community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
