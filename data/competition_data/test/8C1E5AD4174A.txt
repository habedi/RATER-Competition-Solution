Dear Principal,

I don't think you should make kids have a grade point of B or better to be able to participate in sports. One reason is because that is the kids life and you shouldn't be able to control a kids life outside of school. I think you might be able to control them if they are on a school team because that is actually part of school, but not a team built by contributors to make kids have fun. While you may think that school comes before fun, you are wrong. I would bet you that 75% of kids would rather do a sport than home work. Teachers think that they give out easy homework but half the time "easy" for them is hard for us kids. Therefore we don't even get much time to play sports. Most of those kids that got below B's got that because they were trying to do good on their sports team. Because i know that when you are on a team, like basketball, you can't just get good by working in practice you have to work hard outside of practice. No kid would get that time if they had to be inside doing homework all day.

Also, a C is passing, hey even a D is passing. So why make kids do extra work when they are all ready passing. It's just more work for you. i know you definitely don't want to have to be up all night grading kids papers and thinking how sad you made kids feel because you wouldn't let the compete in sports. Also, if you just let kids compete in sports we wouldn't have a 61% obese ratio you would have let fat people in the world and it would help kid get that extra energy that they have inside them someplace to go.

Another reason you should let kids participate in sports is many kids role models are famous sports player, LeBron James, Peyton Manning, and others. If you make kids have to study or do homework. that hope in that person fades and they begin to get depressed. Nothing is more sad than when a little boy loses faith in his big basketball player, Michael Jordan.

In conclusion, i think you should rethink the policy that states that no person shall participate in a sport unless he or she has a grade point higher than a C. My reasoning is you can't really control kids. There actually is no way to make someone do something. Even if you say you can't play sports they might go ahead and play for a team that the principal doesn't know about.
