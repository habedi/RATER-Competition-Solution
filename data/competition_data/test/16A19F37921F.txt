How lonely would a student be if someone were to take school classes from home? They would be extremely lonely because they wouldn't have a lot of people around them,it would only be their family and their wouldn't be any fascinating events to attend. However, if they attend classes at a public or private school, they will have people to help them grow mentally. Waking up early in the morning to go to school is a different feeling than waking up early to self teach yourself majority of the time. It wouldn't be beneficial to attend classes from home because of boredom, it would be harder to learn and it wouldn't prepare the students for the real world.

It wouldn't be beneficial to attend classes from home because of boredom. When they start school young, they seek things they never seen or did before;adventures that will keep them active the entire day. If they attend classes at home it would be considered boring. Taking classes at public or private schools will keep a kid from the age of four to eighteen awake and excited and their grades will be better compared to being home schooled. They will be fascinated and intimated by cool events at school like recess,school dances and sports from preschool to twelfth grade. It will keep the students motivated to do well in school and be on the look out for specific dates of events or sports. It will encourage them to do well in school because they would need decent grades to attend the events or sports like soccer. If someone were to take classes at home, the student would be very bored and they wouldn't be motivated as much because they wouldn't have any events to attend or play any sports. It is natural for students to do good at something they have fun doing or something to look forward to. However being home schooled, one of their only inspirations would be their family while in school they would have many inspirations like their friends. These are the reasons as to why we wouldn't benefit very well from being able to attend classes from home.

Their wouldn't be a very decent effect to attend classes from home than in public schools because it would be harder to learn. To attend classes from home, they wouldn't have a lot of support compared to the support in public or private schools. In a way, taking classes at home could be beneficial if they aren't lazy to go to the bus stop or walk to school, but mainly it wouldn't be beneficial. Attending classes at school is better than at home because of the amount of support they get. There are more than an average of 20 teachers for every public school and they would do anything in their ability to help them do well in the classes they are taking. They could answer any question on any homework, classwork and can help them with study guides to prepare them for hard tests. After all, they are the ones that teach the material and assign the assignments. But if they were to attend classes at home, it would be harder to ask questions because they wouldn't have any teachers. While in school their are a lot of teachers; being home schooled they would have to watch videos and self teach themselves. As humans, it is harder to learn things if they don't have someone having the knowledge and sharing it with the students which is why it wouldn't be beneficial to attend classes at home.

As students get older and mature, life gets more adventurous with many difficult obstacles which is why it wouldn't be beneficial to attend classes from home. It wouldn't prepare them for the real world after school. After students graduate from school, it will be the time period where they will experience the real world of suffering or agony. They start to lose people they love and lose connection with friends. Therefore, attending classes at home won't let them experience that much compared to attending classes at school. If they attend classes at school, problems will occur, such as friends and relationship problems throughout their time in school. Experiencing those types of problems are painful because friends/girlfriends/boyfriends are one of the first people you get attached with but in the student's mind they will mature from those problems and they will slowly start to mature to an adult. As a young adult, you don't rely on friends or relationships but first it would be yourself. However, attending classes at home, kids wouldn't have the ability to experience those things,maybe they will, but it definitely wouldn't be a good preparation for the real world after high school. Life is tough and unfair, and after the students finish school they will realize that all of their problems will be dealt by themselves and their problems were minor. In general, attending classes at home wouldn't be very beneficial.

With all the examples and reasons as to why it would be more beneficial to attend classes at public schools, taking classes at home wouldn't be beneficial and even though it could possibly decrease the chances of common mental problems like depression and suicide,it could go both ways. If the student's don't have a lot of support around themselves, kids naturally start to get lonely and they start to get sad and eventually start to become depressed and possibly have thoughts of suicide. But even if they attend classes at school, they get bullied by people they consider their friends so it could also increase the chances of depression and suicide .School is like a roller coaster it has its good moments and bad moments but at the end of the day the students will graduate. With all of this being said, personally, students wouldn't be able to benefit very well from attending classes at home than taking them at public schools or private schools because of boredom, it would be harder to learn and most importantly, it wouldn't prepare them for the real world.
