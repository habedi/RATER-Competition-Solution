Luke seems to like the program, because you help people of other countries,you also play baseball,volleyball, you can fence, table tennis, boxing, reading, and whittling. You can actually see what happens around the world and help other countries.

"It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs," Luke says, you can help countries that are in ruins after World War II. You get to take care for horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. It is a huge responsibility, but it is worth doing. You get to feed the animals, which is like going to a petting zoo for free, besides all the work. You also get to travel to places while you are at a certain country. I wouldn't think it is so easy, because you have to do a lot of work it is harder than it sounds, but you are doing it for a good purpose. It is certainly a great opportunity to help animals get good care and to travel to other countries. I would love the sight seeing and feeding the animals. Although it seems like a lot of work, Luke seemed to have a blast.

I think Luke had a great time and so will you when you get the opportunity to help animals get special care and to help the countries of the world.
