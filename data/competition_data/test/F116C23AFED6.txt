Venus should be studied because there may be other life forms on it. The article says that venus is like the morning star. So we should treat it like the morning star. We should also work out and take rocket fuel when we can so if someday we get to Venus we can be the alphas. Mars also has life forms and we should take them down like it's Star Wars. Venus also has valuable resources such as metal and rock and other things we need. We should send over rovers first before we go ourselves.

It could be very dangerous if we just waltz in there. NASA should send out a rover and test it and see what is going to happen if we step foot on there. We have the technology so why can't we do it. Our travles beyond earth should not be limited by danger and we should be fearless. We are also going to have to build suits that can make us step foot on there and see what we can do and get from this planet. Someday we may have to leave Earth and go to another planet and we are not going to know which one to go to because we haven't studied it yet so i encourage that we should go to Venus and see what we can do with it. We own the universe. So we should explore more.
