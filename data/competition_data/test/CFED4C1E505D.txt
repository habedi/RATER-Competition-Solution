The author of "The Challenege of Exploring Venus," reasons for exploring venus are the planet could be the one that most resembles earth and to further scientific research.

The author wants us to be aware if Venus is the closest planet we have to Earth, and I dont mean proximity, im talking about most alike. They believe that It once had green life on it, oceans, and a livable atmosphere. The text states,"Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with ocens and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth." The text also says,"Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but surviable." With those things in mind scientist feel it is a need to go see if it is like or if it was once like Earth.

Venus could also be used to just to further scientific studies. The text states" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a dstance." The rock and gas samples and all the other things can be used to compare to rocks and gases here on Earth, see what is the same and what is different about them to get a better understanding of how alike or diiferent the two planets are.

To conclude, what the author wanted us to get from that article was that, the planet Venus could be very similar to Earth and that they could use it to futher scientific studies by studying the nature on the panet.
