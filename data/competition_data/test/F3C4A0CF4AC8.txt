Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to discuss with you the new cell phone policy you are thinking of making for this school. I think you should let us use our phones during lunch and free time because we could then get in touch with our parents if we had to. Another reason is that if we needed the homework for something we could then contact a friend. The last reason is because this would give us something to do during x-block or lunch if we don't have anything to do. I would like you to please read my letter to consider the idea.

Cell phones should be allowed at lunch and free times because if our parents needed to contact us for an important reason then we would be able to. For example if one of our family members got injured and we couldn't use our phones then how would we know that. Or if your parents couldn't be home for you after school and you had to go to a neighbor's house you wouldn't know. Having phones available to be used during lunch and free times could definitely benefit communication with our family's for important reasons.

Just say you forget your homework for Spanish and you know a friend in another home room has the same teacher as you, instead of getting up and walking their you could text him an ask for the homework. I think that this could improve the percentage of completed homework assignments. I know that I sometimes forget to write down my home work in my planner so if I could text someone to find out what it was I could get it done. I know that your probably thinking you can do that after school, but if you have many activities like me you will be really busy, and might forget to ask.

My final reason is that sometimes you have no home work and just sit around during x-block and talk. Some teachers don't like when you talk and get mad. If we could use our phones then we could talk to each other, but it would be quiet, so the teachers can't hear any noise. I'm not saying it would be one hundred percent quiet, but it would definitely make a difference. Having phones at x-block could definitely keep kids busy and maybe even out of trouble.

I conclusion having phones could really impact our school in many ways. It could keep family's closer if they are needed and maybe even help kids get homework if they forget it. This could maybe help bring up the percentage of homework assignments completed. This could also keep kids busy if they have nothing to do at x-block. Keeping kids busy at x-block could even lead to less kids getting in trouble. Thank you for reading this and I hope you considered my reason.

Sincerely,
