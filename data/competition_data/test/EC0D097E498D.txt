After the school year ends and summer begins, many students will, more often than not, forget a fair amount of the information they learned during the prior school year. In order to combat this, many schools have begun to give summer projects to its students do over the break in order to enrich their learning. There have been many ideas as to whether these sumer projects should be student designed or teacher desgined. While student desgined projects would be a good way for many students to be introduced to new and intresting topics, student desgined projects wouldnt be as beneficial to learning as teacher desgined projects, because teacher desgined projects are designed to challenge you and teachers always have the best ways to further students' educations in mind.

When teachers give out work to sudents, its always chosen to be the best way for those students to learn in that scenario. Teachers creating the summer assignment for students would be much more beneficial as apposed to if a student were to create a summer project. That is because teachersÂ want to see their students learning in a beneficial way so they would give work solely to help see them grow. With teachers creating the projects, they will know exactly what the students need in order to get further in life, while a student wouldn't have a solid grasp on what is needed to succeed. To conclude, with teachers creating the assignments, it would be the most beneficial to the students learning.

When creating new work to give to their students, teachers alwyas find way in order to challenge their students. If students were to create summer projects, it wouldnt chalenge other students. Many students that do work, prefer to do the bare minimum required to pass, and that would be reflected in the student designed summer projects. Without a force challenging them to do better, many students would rather do as little work required in order to pass. This would be reflected in the summer assignments, with many of them done half-heartedly. To conclude, student summer assignments wouldnt challenge other students in the same way that teacher designed once would.

With student designed projects, however, many students could be expossed to new and interesting topics that they would've never previously thought of as interesting; nevertheless, students wouldn't know what would be required in order to have an enriching assignment that'd help with learning. When students create projects, they could bring in topics that they like and share them to the school to help create the summer projects, but they wouldnt have a solid grasp on what would be needed in order to help further the education of their peers. To conclude, student designed summer projects could be new and interesting, but the students creating them wouldn't know what is needed in order to assist their peers.

In conclusion, teacher designed summer projects would be more beneficial to the enrichment of their students' education, because the teachers know what skills the students will need in order to succeed in life; however, wjile student created summer projects would be more fun and interesting, it wouldnt be nearly as beneficial to other students' educations, as they wouldnt have a good grasp on what is need in order to further their education.
