Theres diffrent ways you can show your emotion or how you feel. Why would you need a system to show how you you feel ?

You dont need a system to show you how you you feel becuase what if it tell you the wrong stuff, if it dont work right, what if it break on you and you dont know it?

Nobdy need a sytem to show there emotions. How would you know if they dont want to show it. Not everybody what to express they feeling. Sometimes they want to keep it to they self . If they wanted to express they self im pretty sure they would of went to the family doctor or something.

The system go through a long proces so that mean it go start from the bottom and make it way up. Would´nt that feel weird if you had a mechiane going through your face? Let´s say it was like a carmea or something then that would be better but it a whole macheine working you. It? really not that deep when you can just say how you feel. It really that easy just say it becuase who want to sit though that?

Mona LIsa says ¨ät least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions¨ Lies. Ther no computer that can¨t recognzie how you feel and if it is it´s fake. Half of the stuff on the web now is fake like it just be uo there to jus t for attitiention. That why people look in books now days becuase they can atleast belive them. Don´t belive everthing off the internet it not all real.

Theres diffrent ways you can show how you feel. You dont always need a system to tell you expression. Sometime only you and yourself need to know how you personaly feel at times nobody else.
