Aliens and natural lanforms are both explanations to describe the Face on Mars. Some people believe that the Face was made by marsians or "aliens", but then there are also some that believe it is a natural landform. But I have information to prove that it's just a natural lanform.

Twenty five years ago, NASA had took a photo of what looked like a human face. A couple of days later NASA released the photo the the public and people started to describe it as "Face on Mars". On April 5, 1998, Micheal Malin and his MOC took a photo that was 10 times sharper than the oringinal. That showed to prove that it is anatural landform.

Some may beleive that the Face on Mars was created by alien, but there is proof that shows it is just a natural landmark. There is probably still scientist out there researching to find better proof. But it all comes down to what do you believe?
