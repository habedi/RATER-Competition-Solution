A day without drivng your car? who can't do that. Also making the Earth a better place to live? awsome! Taking advantage of a limiting car using its a great idea because people are lowering air pollution and there's no more rush-hour. Getting stuck in traffic isn't pretty nice and most likely if you have a meeting your going to be late. Also people just dont want to own cars anymore.

To start off, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because people are lowering air pollution. In source 2, the author explains "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog .. rivaled in Beijing, China, Which is known as one of the most polluted cites in the world." This means that cars are bad for the enviroment they had to decresse the number of cars so they could stop the smog becuase they didn't wanted to end up like china. But however, not useing cars is affecting car industry like it states in source 4 "since transportation is the second larges source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implication for the car industry." Never the less, air pollution is the main problem like in source 3 in Bogota "The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog." The reason they are doing this is for people to find another way to get to their destination and to reduce smog as it states.

Furthermore, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because there's no more rush-hour. Advoiding traffic is great like in source 3 " Bogota, Colombia- In a program that's spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tok buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic." Colombian's do this to advoid traffic and its a cool way because you could ride bikes and skated. Likwise in source 4 some Children don't get their driver license its not because they're lazy it's because they don't need them, yeah they come in handy but they're not interseted for example in source 4 they stated "They organized their summer jobs and socail life around where they can walk or take public ransportation or car-pool with friends." having a car isn't a teenager main interst, they rather walk to a close by place or car pool with their friends.

To sum up, in my opinion I think limiting car usage is a great idea because less air pollution, rush-hour, and some people just don't want to own cars.
