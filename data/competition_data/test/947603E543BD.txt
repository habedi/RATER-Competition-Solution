Looking at the factors of being able to visit Venus the author has some great points in the passage due to how dangerous it seems, The author is very correct on even asking why scientists are so drawn to visiting this unexplored planet for good reasons alone. The planet Venus has some pros and also cons. it may well once was a planet just like Earth a long time ago but that we only know. and some pros is that maybe that planet could possibly even help scientists with new possible discoveries.

Elon musk is one who is also trying something beyond of what we have ever set our sights on. he is trying to find a way to colonize mars!!, yet we also have plans to visit Venus. The Author also has some very good points on why its so difficult to even get close to the planet at all. When stated "Each previouse mission was unmanned, and for a good reason" in paragraph 2 is almost forshadowing the dangers of the plannet Venus.

Due to a very thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blanket venus is one of the dangers of the planet, so looking at the factors again on why the Author thinks why Venus is very difficult to set foot on or even get close to, We can just look at the planet from a safe distance. for now.
