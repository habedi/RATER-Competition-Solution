If we reduce how often we drive a car it can benefit us, because using a car too often can have negative affects on our health, and our enviroment, and the cost is exspensive.

To begin with using a car too often can have negative affects on our health, because If we depend on cars too much it can cause us to feel stressed and tense. We can not go outside and take a walk because the rodes are too packed. Being able to even walk outside to a store has become more difficult because stores are being placed far away.

But if we reduce cars then stores will become more accessible to us because they will only be a walk away. So that we can excersize and feel less stressed about depending on a car too much to go anywhere.

In addtion our enviroment is being destroyed each day because we are spreading gas in the air that comes from cars. But in a community called Vauban, Germany they are making efforts  to not use cars. There are only two places where you are allowed to park.

Finally, the costs of cars are to high for people to be able to afford them.
