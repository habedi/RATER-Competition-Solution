I am against driverless cars. There are many problems that could come with these types of cars. If cars like these were produced so many things could enter into effect. I am against driverless cars becuase they can be very dangerous, the productions of the cars would cost alot of money,and there could be serious malfunctions.

One reason that i am against driverless cars is because of the serious safety issues. According to the passage it states that the human driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires it. This could cause serious problems. If the driver falls asleep he/she might not hear or feel any alerts. This then could turn into a crash when for example a work zone or a accident appoaches. So many people could be injured.

Secondly, Im against driverless cars because of the cost. These cars will result in spending billons of dollars. What would happen to all of the regular cars? Will they just get thrown away? Throwing away millons of cars would result in mlillons of dollars going in the trash. Can you just add the nessecary parts to make it driverless? If that could happen it would save money, but you would still have to buy the correct parts. What about the cars from the 80's or even the 90's would these cars have the correct parts to make them driverless; If not there goes thousands of dollars going down the drain. Producing the cars would cause serious debt.

Lastly, driverless cars could have serious malfunctions. These cars rely on electricty to keep them going. Say for example we have a serious power outage;think of how many crashes could happen if thousands of cars stopped in the middle of a busy highway. Also think about it electricty and water do not mix; so what happens when it rains or when it snows are the cars still protected. Many malfunctions can occur due to the car having to run off of energy.

So when i hear the words " driverless cars". An large some of problems come to my mind. I Think of the many problems that come with it, the lack of saftey, the amount of money spent and wasted and the crazy malfunctions. These are just a few reasons why I am against driverless cars.
