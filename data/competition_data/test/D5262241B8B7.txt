In the modern world, it's uncommon to see someone without a car. Most people own at least one, and use it frequently. In America, suburban areas have few public transport options available making it difficult to get to work or to a store without using a car. However, cars are a massive source of greenhouse gas emissions. Not only that, car accidents have led to millions of injuries and deaths. While companies are working to procure cleaner, safer car models all the time, other countries are taking actions to lower the number of people using personal automobiles every day.

In Vauban, Germany, cars are actually banned. This town is much cleaner, and its residents are all happy with the rule. Stores and buildings are placed closer together, making them accessable to more people. Many people bike and walk to the places they need to be. Not only is it good exercise, it cuts down on the pollution going into the air and destroying the ozone. By not driving, no one has to be plagued by the worries of speeding, not going fast enough, getting hit, hitting someone else, or paying for gas. The town, finished in 2006, has done well so far. Germany isn't the only country interested in lowering car usage, though.

Recently, Paris was forced to enact a partial driving ban due to smog levels getting out of control. For a while, they were on the same level with Beijing, which is infamous for its horrible pollution. Car emissions have been, as Elisabeth Rosenthal put it in her article, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", "choking cities". Paris' solution to the issue was forbidding cars with even-numbered lisence plates to be driven one day, and then odd-numbered ones the next. Many people were unhappy with this, but the smog quickly cleared up to acceptable levels.

Meanwhile in Colombia, Bogota has a ban on cars as well, though it only lasts for one day a year. Contrasting with the reactions of the French, the citizens of the capitol willingly participate and use other means of transportation. Because of this, the usual traffic jams and wrecks are drastically minimized. This day without cars promotes public transport and lowering smog levels in big cities. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, vocalized his opinion of the event, saying that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." The car-free day has led to plenty of changes in the city, such as safer, better sidewalks, less traffic, and more condensed stores and restaurants that are closer together.

While it's definitely more common to see someone driving a car than biking to work, steps have been made towards a cleaner future that doesn't involve nearly so many cars. More Americans are limiting their car usage when they can every year. With cell phones and the Internet, it's now much easier to make car pooling arrangements, as well as interacting through the internet without having to leave and drive somewhere. The younger generation is becoming less concerned with getting a license, and is taking up organizing their lives around not having a car. With the recession, cars are becoming harder to afford and maintain. If people can get around those costs, they will. By limiting car usage, pollution levels are dropping, as well as the casualties that come with reckless driving.
