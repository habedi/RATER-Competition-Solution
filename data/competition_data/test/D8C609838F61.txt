The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. But is this advcanced system valuable or particularly necessary? In my opinion, although this coding system is brilliant, there is not a need for it in the classroom.

The fact that I live in a time where computers could calculate my mood and or my emotions is nothing short of amazing. But, this coding system doesnt benefit the consumer at all. In paragraph six, D'Alto gives an example of a computer analyzing your mood as you come across an ad. So, if you come across happy or smiling the computer will continue to display like minded ads but, if your computer sees that you are frowing upon seeing the ad it will direct you to different ads. Now this is great for the compant who sells whatever is in the ad, they get to literally profit by this technology. But what does it do for the one viewing ads? Nothing.

Another example given in paragaph six is in a classroom setting. Dr. Haing states "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". I'm not saying that this technology cannot do what it claims but what it does is utterly uneeded in a classroom setting. If a student is becoming confused about a certain topic they should raise their hand and ask a teacher (even online run courses always ave a teacher there to supervise). They should seek out a teacher guidance because, at least in my school district. cirriculum cannot be altered.

My district is made up of is five different highschools. All five teach the same exact math, english, and science curriculum. So, the computer would not even be permitted to change my lesson even if I was confused. So whats so helpful about a notification appearing on my screen saying thay I am about 63% confused? the answer is simply, its not.

In conclusion, although this software sounds very talented in what it is capable of achieving, is not useful in the classroom. This specific technology would quite honeslty serve me and my fellow classmates no use at all. What this software can do is what almost any human can achieve with sight and cognitive skills. Give me valuable software that will give me alternate youtube videos or websites to hellp me if im confused not software that just tells me im confused.
