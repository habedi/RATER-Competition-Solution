Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. There has been an recent argument stating if those projects should be designed by the students or teachers. Some state, projects should be teacher-designed because it will help students prepare for the upcoming school year, widen their knowledge of unknown subjects, and let's them apply critical thinking, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, I believe summer projects should be student-designed.

There are a variety of reasons on why summer projects should be student-designed. One reason why they should be student-designed, is that the projects would be aimed toward their age. This is the case because, projects made by students would appeal more to the other students. It would also make the process of the project more fun because it is aimed towards the students' age. Another reason summer projects should be student-based, is that it would have more modern-based topics and issues. For example, the projects would have relevant issues of their society like, LGBT rights, school shootings, and police brutality. These projects would also have interesting topics students may enjoy. Those topics could be about: social media, celebrities, fashion, and sports. Student-based projects would also include diverse options. Student projects would let students have the option of doing group work. This would develop the students teamwork as well as their work ethic. Another option student-based projects would provide are projects related to students' hobbies and skills. Projects that require hands-on activities or art-like objectives, would strongly interest students into doing them.

There are further reasons why summer projects should be student-based. Student-based projects would be easier to understand. Since the projects were made by students, the projects would help the students understand the information. Unlike a project made by teachers, student-based projects would help students learn at a way easier and faster level. When the projects are easier to understand, this would improve students' attention span. Another reason why summer projects should be student-based, is that students would obtain better grades. Students would improve at a subject at a far better level, because the projects would be topics that they enjoy. Since the project accommodates to them, the students would earn way better grades than something that doesn't interest them. When something interests a person, they tend to want to understand it at a far better level. The final reason, student-based projects are more beneficial, is that it would provide better learning. Students would be more invested in a student-based project, because it would be directed towards them. They would also be more involved, which would inevitably, make them learn better.

I believe projects over the summer should be student-based. This is the case due to: it being aimed towards the students' age and it being more interesting. Those who disagree state: teacher-designed projects would help students get real practice, prepare the students, and help students widen their knowledge. I believe academic scores in school would be at an all time high due to students appliance to student-based projects than ever before.
