Dear,

TEACHER_NAME

I believe children should be able to use and also bring there phones to school. Just for the fact if something happens on there way to school they would be able to call there parents and notify hem what happen. Or maybe after school they get kid napped and they don't got there phone what are they going to do. Like for example i bring my phone to school just in case something happens.

I don't think kids shouldn't be able to bring there phones. What if there parents needs to tell you something like come straight home. Then they would know not to stay after school. If I was the principle i would allow children to bring there phones as long as they don't use it in class. There are lots of reasons kids should be able to have phones the have calculators on them they help you do everything like check your email. Stuff like that there like a little laptop and also teachers have them why cant we.

Schools shouldn't care off of the little things. We text instead of wasting paper. Instead of going to the office to use there phones we could use are own. Its just lunch it wouldn't hurt any one its not like were in class. most kids would probably bring there phones any way I bet if they made it to were we cant bring or phones most of the kids would still bring them. It would probably make them bring it even more. Well any way its not really up to me but if it were i would go with phones out at lunch.
