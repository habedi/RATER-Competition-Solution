In 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus," is a great informative story that tells the readers about Venus and its presents. According to the story, Venus has so much in common like our plant Earth. Not only is Earth dangerous but also is Venus. In the author's story it has details about Venus of it's surface, temperature, and how it is the most relatable planet to Earth. Venus is also like our twin planet for it's density and size. How it relates is so many information that people that travel to Venus have to be very careful at what there going for. At most times Venus is a great planet at its presents but also dangerous too.

The almost negative outcomes of Venus is not only the planet it self but how it is inside being in the planet too. The atmosphere of Venus is 97% carbon dioxide which could be challenging for the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric. It's temperature is the hottest surface of any planet in our solor system. It is every dangerous to even land in Venus surface. People who go to space travel to Venus have to spectate high in the sky to see Venus for it's dangeruos surface. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air presure in Venus would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Not easy condition to be there, but survivable for humans.

The most positive outcome of Venus is many small and big deatils about the planet it self. Venus, sometimes called "Evening Start," is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. It is easy to spot in the sky, even an amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus is most like Earth too. Venus is not only our neighboor but inside the planet is covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar feature such as valleys, mountians, and craters. It is also the nearest option for a planetary visit.

Venus is the most relatable planet like Earth. Because of it's planet being so close to Earth and people going physically to space travel to Venus, we have got great information from them. What sucks it that researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Plus adding that Venus surface is the hottest surface in the universe, who would dare to even go down the surface and risk their life's when it is dangerous. Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk of our planet sakes. Human are curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. It is a great challenge for us humans to get a great look at 100% in Venus with out thinking it is a dangerous challenge and a big risk taker. These are reasons with Venus is the most relatable planet like Earth.

Not even our great technology can stand in Venus without having a curoption. Modern day computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physcial conditions. Researchers have found out that mechanical computers are useful by using gear and lever and how shoking these devices make calculation. and do not require technology at all. All these reasons are why the author tell us of how great and dangerous Venus can be, either for a visit or a great risk to investigate.
