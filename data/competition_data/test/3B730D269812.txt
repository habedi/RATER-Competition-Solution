Hello! My name is Luke and Iam taking part in the "Seagoing Cowboys Program." It is amazing to see how awesome God's nature can be. It feels really good to go to different places and see cool things but know that you are serving God by helping others.

I joined the program for many reasons. I joined because I have a really good friend named Don Reist. He talked to me about how they do things there and how much fun it is. So I thought, if I went and was serving people and helping them survive, would it be good for me, and then I knew that God was calling me to do this and I wanted to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, so I said, "Yes."

Once I got there, I heard that there were 44 nations and that we were going to form UNRRA, wich meant, (the United Nations Relief nd Rehabilation Administration). Don and I had signed up for the "Seagoing Cowboys," where you take care all of the animals. It wasnt what I had expected, but it was still something that I could serve God for.

I had served for many years and I am very happy that I chose to do this. If I haden't then I would be stuck working a bank and grocery store. So that is my story and my many reasons why you should join our group and make the world a better place!

In conclusion, I think that you should totally join. If you are thinking about it then that is just fine. Just think quik!
