The principal has chosen to make each student participate in an extracurricular activity. So now students are forced to join a sports team or a club every day, but not every student is able to participate. Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they may be too busy, uninterested, or they don't have the energy to.

Students may have things they must do that are not school related once they get home. For many of them, they have to do chores such as cleaning the house or walking a dog. Others may have to go home and watch younger siblings because their parents come home late and forcing them to go after school activities prevents them from helping their family. Some students may even have a job such as a cashier at a local supermarket that they have to go to in order to provide for themselves and their family.

Most of the time though, students are just uninterested in participating. Some students feel as if the dont need to stay at school for another two hours or more when they are already required to be there for seven. Although some of the students might not like joining a sports team, the student council, or any of the other activities that are available.

School can also be very draining for students. School is a very social place and the students of a school usually fall into three categories. Many students can be a extrovert which means the enjoy socializing and feel energized doing so. They may also be a introvert and are they exact opposite of extroverts because they prefer to be alone. They can still be social they just prefer to do less. Then there are students that fall in between which are known as ambiverts. So depending on how the students feel about social interaction it will effect their desire to socialize more after school. School is also very stressful to the majority of students. That results in a lot of students being exhausted and just wanting to go home and sleep.

Students do not need to stay after school because they have things to do that are not school related, are not interested, and many don't have the energy to. Schools want their students to be more engaged in their learning but if schools are unable to let students take a break from it then more and more students stressed since they can not do the other things that they are required to do and make them feel like school is a prison.
