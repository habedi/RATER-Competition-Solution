I disagree with the principal in their decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities. I disagree, because some students may have to help their parents after school, have a job, or they might not feel comfortable participating in these activities. One reason, students may have things to help with at home that are more important then using up their time on extracurricular activities. Another reason, other students might have a job, in the after school hours. Lastly, some students might not feel comfortable participating in the activities, and they should have a say in if they want to participate.

Some students have to help their parents, after school, with things that are much more important than these activities. Students may live on a farm, and have to help out with it daily. Other students do not have both parents to help with chores, so they have to help a lot. Some students might have a younger sibling or a pet at home that they have to help out with if the parents need it, or if the parents are not home. So, a number of students have to help with very important things, instead of participating in these activities.

Some students might have a job in the after school hours. Jobs are very important to students, and can help pay for things if their parents are not financially stable. Jobs can teach students important life skills that they will need in their near future. Some jobs will teach you a lot about having a job, you can use that when you get out of school to help get better jobs. In conclusion, if the principal forces these students to participate, then they will have to quit their jobs and lose all of these important qualities of having a job.

Lastly, some students may not feel comfortable participating in extracurricular activities. A number of students may not be social, and do not like being around people. Other students may have something physically wrong with them, and they can not participate in the activity that they want to, leaving them feeling left out. Students might not like any of the activities available, so it just makes their life that much more miserable and stressful. So, if you force these students into participating, they may feel uncomfortable and nervous, when they could just have the choice to not participate.

In conclusion, my disagreement with the principal has many good reasons behind it. I think that it should be recommended to participate, but you do not absolutally have to. The school should think about the important things that the students have to do on their own time. And if a students tries the activities and feels uncomfortable the should be able to stop doing the activity, and not be forced to do it. No student should ever be forced to do something, because not all students are the same.
