Imagine a teenage mom, a junior in high school. This is a glimpse into her everyday life. 5:00 am, wake up to feed your baby and get ready for school. 6:00 am, Go to school.2:00 pm, get out of school and go to your part time job at whataburgers. 7:00 pm, go home take care of your baby, do your homework and study, 10 pm, work your night shift and the 24 hour taco bell. 2 am, you get home take care of your baby and maybe get some sleep. Both of these jobs still don't pay enough for everything that you need, but you still go to school determined to go to college and get a good job. But then you find out that community service is required and you realize that you don't have enough time to be in school because of this new requirement. So your forced to get a fulltime job, that doesn't require a high school or college degree.

Kids who wish to and have time to do community service should do it, but it shouldn't be required off all kids to respect the difference in their lives, and the following reasons.

1. Public school is for all kids despite the situation at home, and their parents are the taxpayers supporting this school, there fore the school should respect every students home situation and not make an impossible requirement for kids who can't meet it.

2. If community service becomes a requirement, it is likely that more people will drop out of high school.

3. Kids who are in sports may have to sacrifice practices for community services, when sports can get kids into college's when otherwise they wouldn't be able to go.

In conclusion if there's a good amount of people interested in community service, then there should be an after school club, or perhaps an actual elective were you can do community service during school hours, so it wouldn't have to interfere with after school agenda. Having Required activities that take place after school hours is not fair to all students, therefore should remain a choice among students.
