Having no car may seem really bad but in all reality it might not be bad at all. People become happier without having to do with the stress of driving cars, and it makes cities denser.

People driving cars have alot of stress to deal with when they're in a vehical. They have to pay attention to they're surroundings and also to themselves. Some people have a lack of attention, and that also makes things harder on them. Walking places would make a person happier not only because they don't have to deal with all the traffic and the stressfulness of dealing with other drivers, but it gets them in great shape. Cars seem to rule the world. They mess with the density and the pollution has gotten out of control. Cars take down so much gas, and it isn't good for the enviorment. Americans are buying fewer cars, and driving less each year.

If we lower the usage of cars the Earth will be healthier, and the people would be happier. And everyone wants a happy, healthy life.
