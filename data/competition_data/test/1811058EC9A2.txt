I think this technology might be helpful for students, but it could also be a bad thing. It could be good for students becase it would show how they really feel about the work so the teacher would know that their confused, bored, or angry. In the paragraph 3 it talks about what it is capible of in facial recognizion and how it could chage a lesson to better suit a student just by their facial expression. I also believe it could be a bad thing. For example would you like someone to know what you're thinking just by your exepression. Lets say your're talking to a friend of yours and they ask you what you think about their favorite song and you know its their favorite song, but you really don't like it all and you dont want to maybe hurt their feelings by saying what you really think, so you might say " it's ok" or "not my style". Now think if this technology was out there that you might not be able to do that, and you might not be able to hide how you really feel. That is why I think this technology could be a good thing and a bad thing.
