The reason we have not got to Venus yet is because all of the dangers that are stopping us from getting there there are many reasons but the main reasons is because it is to hot to land on the surface even tho is is not the closest to then sun it is the hottest planet. So since it is the hottest planest we cant get close to it with out us burning to death. So we cant land there so we willhave to find a way to grt as close as possible without dieing. Another reason it the amount of pressure on the planet is so strong that it would crsuh a submarine that is made for going and being able to stay at a high pressurer and not crush or break but if it where to go to venus it wiuld be crudh like a person crushing a peice of paper. We think we have found a way to get close to it we could use a blimb type of system and stay 30 miles above the planet. The temputrue would still be 170 degrees and thats still hot but if used solor power from the sun it should stay nice and cool inside the blimb. The last reason is our tecnology is not strong enugh to stand the heat it would melt and then there was no point of going to take like pictures and it would kinda be a waste of money so we need tecnology that would help then stay cool and not melt because if we were to go now the temputre is so hot that it would melt ten adn melt just like butter or ice on a hot summer day. So there are meany reasosns that we cant go there yet but if the tecnology gets better and better evry year like it has been we will be able to not just go look at the planet byt to get to go on it.
