Twenty five years ago there was something that had appeared on a Red Planet called Cydonia. An enormous head about two miles from end to end. As the pictures show people think it looks like a face.

Scientists believe that it was just another Martian mesa, these are very common on the planet. But, there was unusual shadows that made it appear to look like an Egyptian Paraoh.

Some people think that the face evidence of life on Mars. Few scientists believe that the face was an alien artifact. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over the planet for the first time, the camera was better than before and had more clearer images of the face. Revealing a natural landform, there was no alien monument after all. Skeptics said that alien marking were hidden by a haze. This landform was most definetly not an alien monument, even though it looks like one. They compare the "face" on the planet to a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. the Middle Butte is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated Mesa about the same height as the "face" on mars.
