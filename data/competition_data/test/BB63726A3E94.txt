Dear Principle

They rules on phones and other devices are very strict, I agree 100% with "Policy 1" i truly think its the best policy for us students. First reason is that its true during class we shouldn't be texting but when we are at lunch i think we should be allowed to text with our friends, I also think we should be able to while not busy like sometimes in advisory or assemblies you know stuff like that.

Now about "Policy 2" I completely disagree because us students need our phone for whatever reason. Not having it at school at all is a bad idea, what if we have an emergency and we need to call our parents or friends after no matter what reason or problem we have. If we ever get our phone taken up we have to pay $15 i think that's a little over board just to get your phone back. So once again i have to totally agree with " Policy 1 " its the least they can do for us and the policy is the most reasonable for me and every other student in the school. so therefore I think every single school in the district or even the nation should have this policy.

Sincerely: Your student
