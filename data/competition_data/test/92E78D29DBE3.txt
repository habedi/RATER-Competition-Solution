Can you imagine what would the future be like if there wasn't anymore gasoline for our cars or other thing that we use it for? We can't use gasoline forever with the cars we have today. There are many different ways that we could drive cars without using gasoline. The sun isn't there for no reason. I'm going to tell why i think i see cars in the future, but made different.

Earth does not have a life time supply of gasoline. We can desgin cars in different ways to make them drive. I think cars should be desgin to take over sometimes, but only at times when you need them. There are probably car crashes every day because someone has fallin asleep on the road, or texting, or drunk. Texting and drinking & driving have became a big thing these days for people these days.

Instead of using gas we could use energy for the sun to drive to car. such as solar power. but just imagine how much those cars would cost. Would they cost way more thsn the cars as of today? Would it have to have less people in the car because what if it takes a sertin amount of people bepending on how much people are in the car. Like i said before the sun isn't there for no reason. Many things as of today live off the energy of the sun's energy.

I believe there are so many ways we could drive cars in the future. I've seen videos where the car was suppose to stop on its on sincer in it. The main two things that i think we could use to keep cars running is solar power in water. The Earth is covered with 75% of water and pretty soon the ice up North is going to start melting and land is going to start over flowing with water in the future.

This is why i think we will still have cars in the future.
