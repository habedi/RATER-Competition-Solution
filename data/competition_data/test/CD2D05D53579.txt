COMMUNITY SERVICE OR NOT?!?!

I strongly agree, that our principle TEACHER_NAME should perform community service. All students need to take a little time out of your schedules and help the earth. Not just students every one who lives on this planet can join and help. He is not asking a lot, speaking for myself,

I will take a stand and do community service. Just think about the oil spill that just happened.

When I was one day watching the news something caught my eyes. There has been an terrible oil spill, in the oceans. Just think about how all the animals felt, when the fish were swimming they were eating and breathing the oil. Over 1,000 of animals have died because of this. Some people just don't under stand they can make a huge difference, just walk along the beach one day just look at all the litter that is around.

People just take advantage , of the situation and just throw there litter on the floor not caring and thinking of what could happen. "Think before you do people."

All that stuff can get washed up on the shore, a jelly fish might mistaken it for a nice little snack or any fish in the water. We all have the chance to make a difference in are world to make are world an better place. Some are just to lazy to do it, i understand on the other behave, will i didn't do it. Just think of if your house was getting robbed and the police said well we didn't do it so there is nothing we can do about it! How would that make you feel? What if Obama the President Of Untied States Of America said well i didn't create all the problems invoking the taxes, and health care, this problems were already here when i got here. You just have to just think of the cost and effect.

I know we are all not perfect but that is no excuse, just take 5 minutes to help out. Maybe just picking up one piece of paper can make a difference. People take life for granted only when they are in trouble or when there kids or something are in trouble they wasn't to bring community service. Don't be selfish being selfish is not going to get you anywhere in life. No offense to the school's i went to in the past, but only two of the schools that i was involved with exactly did community service was, SCHOOL_NAME

Loop Program, also SCHOOL_NAME. We all walked around and picked up trash, around the school and also at Garfield Park. We know it wasn't really go change anything but we know we did something good, and we did our part to save the world. If people just get together and work together we can do anything we put our mind into doing "MAKE A CHANGE" "MAKE A DIFFERENCE.!"
