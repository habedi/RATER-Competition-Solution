I think students should not be allowed to use their phones in school at all because it is to much of a distraction towards that student and everyone else. It wouldn't matter if they could use it during snack or lunch because they are already with their friends during their free times. Letting them use it during snack and lunch will tempt the kids to use it during their periods. The cell phones will distract themselves and their class mates.

When a student uses their phone during class, they are not paying attention to the teacher but only to the text message and will only get half or less of the entire lesson. They would not understand the lesson or might not even remember what the teacher just said. Their grades will drop and the students around him or her will get distracted and might not pay attention to the teacher either. If phones were allowed at school, it might make more trouble then without it. If a student sees their classmate or student next to them use their cell phones during class, that student too will try or at least think about using their phones during class. If this happens too many phones will be taken to the office.

If students were allowed to use their phones during snack or lunch, they would not use it as much because they are already with their friends and their won't be a need to use their phones. If they might not use it during their free time, why allow it at all. Letting the kids use their phones during snack and lunch might tempt the kids to be using their phones during class even more then not allowing them to use their phones at school at all. Changing the rules to make kids use their phones during snack and lunch won't help the kids but make them distracted even more. Problems with phones might happen more often then normal and the parents might not like the idea of letting their kids use their phones during school hours. I think the parents will complain which will make a lot of arguments happen.

I believe that students should not be able to use their phones during school. If students were allowed to have their phones, it will make to much trouble between the teachers and the students. Too many phones will be taken away to the office and it will make a lot of trouble. This is why I believe that students should not be able to use their phones during school even if its snack or lunch.
