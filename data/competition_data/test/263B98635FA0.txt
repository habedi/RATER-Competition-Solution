My position on the arguement is, no, we shouldn't have self driving smart cars. The only reason we would have self driving cars, is to please the wants of drivers now days. People would get worse, and lazier at driving from lack of experiance. The self driving cars are not fully functional either. The cars need to be equipped with hundreds of sensors, and maps that would cost a great chunk of your money too. So, by the time Your finished with the making of the car, it would not even be worth it financially. The self driving car would be a mistake if it does get street legality.

There is no need for self driving cars, unless the people want that luxiory. The is not a fuction that the self driving car can preform that, us as humans, can not do ourselfs. The technology that we have in modern day cars, is almost as far advanced that we need to go, with the exception of fuel efficienty. The manufactures say that the dr0iver should stay alert at all times when they are in a self driving car in case of an emergency, but if we all have self driving cars and are not constantly testing ourselfs on our driving abilities, then how do we know that, when the time comes that you need to take over, that your diving abilities will be good enough?

The self driving cars are also still in the making of being, self drived. For a nessary self diving car, it needs a plethera of sensors and receivers. By the time manufactures do get all of this jammed into a small compact car, the price would be so outrageous, that is wouldn't be worth your money. So, in the making of the self driving car, it would be easier and cheaper to buy a manual car.

The cars themself would be financially irrlogical to produce. An estimate price to buy a brand new, compact car, is about $35,000. Thats just for the car itself. The sensors and receivers that the pland to put on the car, would skyrocket the price of an adverage compact car. Not only that, but im assuming that the cost of labor to make those cars, would also bring up the price. At the end of the day, your paying an extra $10,000 just so you dont have to touch the wheel. Your brain may say yes, but your pocketbook is saying no.

Those are the reasons why self driving cars sould not be allowed to be legalized on the streets in the United States. Not only would they cost more, but they could also Make your driving skills get worse. America should just stay with the tradititonal manual driving cars.
