The challenge of Exploring Venus has been in minds for decades because it is the closes to earth which is why they call it earths twin. Venus aslo has the same density and size in comparison to Earth which in terms occasionally the closets in distance too. "Venus itself is right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spaccraft to land on this cloud draped word". No human has never been to Venus in for good reason, which might be the issue that explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more then three decades. The thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Whats more challenging is the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's amtosphere. Venus's planet surface temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospher's pressure is 90 times than what people experience on Earth. The conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of the oceans and also liquefy many metals. Take note that Venus is has one of the most hottest surface temerature in the entire solar system, though Mercury is the closests planet to the sun. But if Venus is so inhospitable, then why are scientists even discussing to move further visit to its surface. That is because Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it most likely have been the most Earth like planet in the solar system. Venus has probably been the most largely coverd with oceans and possibly could have supported lots of various life forms, just like planet Earth. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes simular features such as mountains, valleys and craters. Venus can also sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, giving the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems "indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive. (NASA) The Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea for sending humans to Venus. NASA's possible solution to the rough conditions on the surface of planet Venus, could initually allow scientists to float above the fray. Put it like this, a huge blimp like vehicle hovering over 30 or so miles above the Venusian landscape. Just like jetplanes traveling at higher altitudes to fly over many storms, just like a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the bad ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Many researchers are working hard on innovations that would allow our advance machines to last a long enough to contribute to our knowledge of Venus. NASA is also working on other approaches to studying Venus. Example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbon have been tested in a chamber which simulate the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for less then three weeks in such condition.
