Dear, TEACHER_NAME

We should allow cell phones in our school. School would be more fun if we were allowed to use our cell phones during our free time or lunch period. Then, turn them off when we get in class. So our teachers won't think we are cheating or being rude to our classmates or teacher. I think kids would stay out of trouble more because students will know the rule is to use the phone during your lunch period or during your free time. Also with these new phones we can get better study time, using the internet. Instead of making the library so busy. A phone can be a good and bad source, but we can think of the positive the phone can bring to our students. Not everyone would have to use this policy, maybe only the students that do not get in trouble as much as the rest of us. When its class time maybe our teachers can check if our phones are off or take them away during class. We can earn our stripes, instead of just receiving the stripes. Being able to have our phones in school would be fantastic.

Sincerely, anonymous
