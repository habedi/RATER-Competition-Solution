Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because not all students like to participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Some students don't like sports because they might not know how to do them or they might not like any sports. Like I'm not good at sports, and i don't really like sports .

Students should be able to do want they want either they do sports or they don't but they should get to choose what they want to do.

Maybe some students like to work on the yearbook and maybe some don't. If the principal is saying that student must join a least one activity and they join the yearbook club and what if they don't like working on the yearbook.

Student council might sound boring to some people or it might sound interesting. If the principal says that you have to join at least one activity and someone does not like to do sports or anything else and they decide to join the student council and what if they think it's boring and if they decide to choose something else then what will they pick because they don't like any other activity.

Over all i disagree because students should be able to do what they want like if they want to do a activity or if they don't.
