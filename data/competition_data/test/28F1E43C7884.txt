The students at SCHOOL_NAME would like you to change the grade policy from B to c' s .Because most of the athletes here are going to games and have practice after school so its hard for them to do there homework because they get home and their tired from running around for a few hours. Then on top of that they have to wary about their game .And that's why the students here think that you should change it from a B' s to c' so that the athletes aren't working so hard.

That's why the students think you should change it from a B to a C so that we don't have to work all the time to keep up with grades and sport at the same time .That's what the students have to say about changing it from a B to

C

thank you for your time and we want u to thank really hard about this.
