Well if My Principal Was To Require All students to Perform Community Service Well im going to Have to say i really Don't Agree Because To Much Work And , Health Problems .

Well to Begin With , in My Opinion if That was to happen i Wouldn't agree Because We already have Enough Work with school , And if that was to happen then we wouldn't have enough time to be with our family . I Also Wouldn't agree because There's Many Different ways in where we could help the community Without being in the sun to much , And ways Where we Don't have to do Much . Secondly in my opinion Community Services is Just to Much We Already Struggle Enough With School So i think we Should have time Off Where we could Have fun with our Family And Friends .

In Addition in my Opinion i Wouldn't Agree Because There's people With Health problems such As Asthma , Back Pain , Leg Pain , Some May be Allergic to the sun . Being Out There doing Community Services is Just to much for middle Schoolers Like Us .

In Conclusion i Think Community Services Aint Such A good Idea Because We Deserve to Have Some time Where we don't Have to worry about School Or nothing like that . But in My Opinion This is My Reasons in Why i Wouldn't Agree if it was ought to Happen .
