The author says that venus is "worthy because it has value and not only because of the lnsight to gained" as the author said in pargaphe 8. I belive that Venus sholud be pursuit because if we cant be on there then whats the point of present. Even thouht Venus is the second planet from the sun it still not safe to go over there. Earth and Venus are some what alike doesn't mean we can go and do some teast on there. Even thought it has some of the same features as Eath. Venus is still not the same. NASA can send people to study Venus put they dont last up there they can died if there out there for more then 170 degrees. The air pressure is close to sea levle on Earth. 97 percent of carbon dioxide is blankets to Venus . The temperatures is over 800 degrees and the atmospheric is 90 times greater then experience on our planet. Venus has one of the hottest surface ever. It also has a rocky surface.
