The making of the FACS was not to good of an idea because what if somebody want's to be left alone and does'nt wan't you to know their emotains? It's kind of cool but eveybody is'nt the same this might affend people because your going into someones personal life now. It states that "Hold on! Can we actually "calculate" emotions like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?" That was a great statement because, i could smile in a picture but actually be hurting inside how can a computer tell that?

I don't think that this will help in schools, or the future. Why would we need FACS when you have your own mindset that can tell you how your feeling? Also friends can tell when one is up or down there are many ways to know the humans emotions without using a computer. I think it's just going into someones personal life without asking and thats never ok. There are many things that we need on Earth but, the creating of FACS is not one.

My introduction is respect others the way you want to be respected.
