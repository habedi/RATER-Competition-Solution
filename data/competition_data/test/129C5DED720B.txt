Summer projects, we all hate them but have to do them at some point. There is no getting around it, so why not design them better? Summer projects are becoming more and more common but a lot of students have concerns about their break being over loaded with work. Is it still considered a break when you have to do home work every night for a solid period of time? I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work, Also its a good use of students time to design and complete a summer project.

I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work over break. If a project is made by students they will make it as simple as can be while also having all the requirements to still learn the information properly. There should not be anything wrong with having a project with the minimum amount of work needed to still learn the topic. Sometimes teachers create projects without realizing how much work must be done to complete the project. If the project was student created with teacher approval a lot of issues would be solved. Student designed projects that have been approved by a teacher will make the work load go down while the students learn the same information. This is all because the project was designed by someone with relatively the same amount of knowledge of the topic.

In my opinion summer projects should be student designed because its a wise use of time to have students create and then later complete a project. Students will learn a lot when designing a project because they must know what the project is on. Creating a project will teach them the info needed to complete the project so they will learn the information and have it stick in their minds too. The students would be able to complete the work reletivley fast because of the fact that they designed the work themselves. I dont see a problem with getting work done faster do you? Having student designing projects for peers to complete a great use of time because students will learn while creating the project. They will also get the work done quicker since they created the assignment.

An opponent of my view might say that a student created project would be made too easy for the class. A flaw that I can immediately point out in this argument is a teacher would have to approve the student made project before assigning it. A teacher would never approve of a project that didnt make the students actually work. While this opposing view makes sense there is a way to make sure the work load is appropriate. I think that teachers should have a strict set of guide lines for the project the students are designing.

Summer assignments should be created by students in an effort to make sure students do not work too hard while on summer break. It's also a good use of time for students when they create their ow assignments. The time it takes to complete the work will go down while the amount learned will grow. Summer vacation is a precious time and should not be spoiled by large and work heavy projects. more schools should consider student designed summer projects, its a smart idea.
