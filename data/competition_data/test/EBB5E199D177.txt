Dear Principal,

We know it's important to do community service to help out others that have there hands full with other responsibilities. We know that we could really help out but some of use just don't really want to give up more of our free time we've got after school. Since we have to do daily homework that our teachers give us, we know we have to do it but we also want to hangout with our friends. We can do our homework before or after we go some place with our friends. The problem is that sometimes we have a lot of homework in our hands do the next day and we sometimes don't get it all done even if we spent all day working on it and not with our friends. Something that could work for us is that we can do community service during school hours. It could be taken as one of the classes we have to take so we can learn how sometimes people really need help with what they do since it could be a lot of things they have to do or a lot of things they have to deal with. It would really help us learn more about what we want to do when we grow up and choose a path to follow for the rest of our life's because we don't want to make a mistake and have to stick to that type of work for the rest of our life's. I say it would be cool to have to do community service during school but not after school. It could be a class were we go to different places and learn more about what the person does like the day that parents come to the school and tell us what there job is, but the difference will be that we get to watch and try it out it would really help us choose more wisely what we want to do. I know that some students wouldn't like that idea at all but maybe after they have tried it out they might like it and would like to do it again. I personally would like to try that idea out and maybe it will be fun to do after all trying things helps us become wiser and know more about the things we want to do about how good our choices are. Like example we wanted to be a doctor and we did community service at a hospital watching and learning more about it and we learn that after that we really want to try something else because being a doctor wasn't what you thought it was. So you try something else like Modeling or taking Pictures and you find that you really love that. It would mean that after all that you have found something that you really like and want to do when your older or maybe you find something else you like better than Modeling and or taking Pictures like cooking, being a Chef. My point is that community service can really help us out to find what we really want to do, our true calling. Since some of the students really wouldn't like to lose there after school time it would be really cool if it was during school that students could go to different place like, restaurants, hospitals, pet stores, stores, and other places.
