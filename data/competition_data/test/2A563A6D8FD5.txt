I don't agree with this decision because a lot of kids may not want to be apart of a sports team or work on the yearbook or be on student council because they may not be good at sports or maybe they are not brave enough to walk in to a classroom with 30 or more kids in a romm and give news about new things or updates on whatever is going on in school.

Kids may not want to be part of a sports team because they may not be athletic or don't want to do winter training. I love sports don't get me wrong but in not about me. I know what i want to do, you shouldn't have to force a kid to do something they don't wanna do or be apart of. A lot of coaches during the winter will push there players especially if they want to be the best or win a ton of games.

Kids may not be artists or good at coloring or anything artistic. Kids may want to focus just on school and that is ok because they want those good grades. They don't want to worry about get a cover for the yearbook or get drawings in when they may have a school project they need to work on. They may have other things they are interested in that is not drawing for the yearbook.

Kids may not want to stand up in front of thousands of kids and talk about good thing but they may not have the courage or the bravery. If they mess up on an announcement they may get laughed at or they may even get talked about not in a good way about it. They are not gonna like it get bullied for it and then they might get scared of coming to school because they don't want to get laughed at or bullied because of it. That is why I don't agree with this idea of having all students do a extracurricular activity.
