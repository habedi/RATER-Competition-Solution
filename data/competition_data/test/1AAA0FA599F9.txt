I both agree and disagree with this change in policy. I believe that both sports and school are important, but that even if you aren't the smartest person ever, you can still compete in sports. I think I'm mostly against it.

I agree with it because, school is important to not just you, but to your family, and your community. Most likely, you're not going to become a famous sports player, and I'm not trying to discourage anyone, but why dump something really important for something you'll probably not succeed at. Not everybody, but most people would agree that school is more important than sports, and that sports should be a privilege only if grades are acceptable. Anyway, B' s really aren't that hard to get, as long as you do your homework, and study for tests.

I disagree because, If sports take up your life and you love them, then a lousy C shouldn't keep you from doing what you want to do, your dream! However, It's a problem if sports are so much that they keep you from doing school, then you shouldn't be allowed to do them. Both are very important, and neither one should be neglected.

Another reason why I disagree with it is that the school shouldn't be barging into our social lives. A student should have the right to or not to do sports, and shouldn't get to be bossed around by the school. What if a little girl or boy with a learning disability wanted to go out for sports but had to be turned down because of their problem. That is discrimination against mental people right there. Also against anyone who grew up wrong and didn't learn how to read or write, or they just never had enough attention to. Back to my earlier reason, the school shouldn't have any say in whether you get to do sports or not.
