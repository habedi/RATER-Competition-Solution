I think drivless cars are great to our future, Having to hold onto the steering wheel while driving this car is accurate , the safety in this car should be built great if not better than a automatic car we drive everyday. This car is a serious and deadly situation , you have a car driving you around and you are not doing just about anything. This idea would benefit alot of drivers for the future , espcially older people that do not long to put there life in danger nor others.

The greatest of our future is evolving with new things as in this car. It will be half the price for gas because it will only be like half a tank price as now days. Genreal motors has a made a test track and it seems to be doing great. In order for this smart car stuff to happen though we will need smarter roads to deal with instead of the roads we have today. These cars will be built and ready for your safety.

The driveless cars will have a video camera mounted on the rear wheel which is safety right there. These cars will have a lot of sensors as in for safety. But today the word is all about safety just image the future as in how much safety will be a concern. For the General motors to come up with such a smart idea we should take this idea and see how great it is. This future car should stop car accidents also. Not to sure on how the car will do on ice or other probiems but im sure General motors will figure this out and get the show on the road. This invention is great and should deffinailty get you happy just thinking about it. I hope this car becomes a invention before i die , i would really love too see it and i hope you would too!
