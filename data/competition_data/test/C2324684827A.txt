Dear principle,

I believe that policy 1 is the better choice. I believe that policy 1 is the better choice because students should have some freedom in school. If a student was using there cell phone in the class room this student should get there cell phone back after class is over. IF there cell phone makes a noise with the teacher is talking, while students are taking a test, or if the cell phone just makes noise in class the student should be reminded that all cell phone should be turned on silent during your class times. School should not be like a prison to children. School years for a child growing into an adult should be the best years of there life not the worst. The students should have there rights about be about to have a say in certain things.

If some student in the class room gets extremely hurt like brakes an arm the students should be able to call that students parents and call 911 if needed.

These are just a few reasons why i believe that policy 1 is a better choice than policy 2.
