Dear Principal,

I believe it is not a good idea to change the policy on sports. I myself do not play sports, but I speak on behalf of those that do. A grade C is considered average. Athletes should not be punished because of an average grade. Also, grades do not directly affect the ability of an athlete. If a student has a C average and they are the best swimmer in the school, a B average student that can barely swim should not take his or her spot. A more logical policy for the grade prerequisites of playing sport could be above a D average. Or perhaps no missing assignments in any of the student's classes. Being average academically should not tell whether or not an individual plays a sport. Or even if you decide to keep this policy, what about those participating in orchestra or drama club? They should have the same policy as athletes. It would be unfair to the players. I hope you rethink the policy. Many great athletes that are average academically would be kicked out. That may cause our team's ability to decrease.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
