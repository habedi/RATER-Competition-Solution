The face is a natural landform for many reasons. I am going to tell you those three reasons.

The first reason is that all this time from when they first took the picture to the last time they took the picture it has never been touched or even looked like it was messed by anyone. Proving that the so called "human face made by aliens" was not only unrealistic but also doubting Nasa, who has been in work since the first time the United states landed on the moon. Reason two, why would you be doubting a group when they have been working on new technoligy for modern space traveling for a long time. Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the "human Face". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do. Nasa even had qualified scientists to make sure it was't an alien face and even confirmed it. The third reason is because on April 5, 1998 when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped pictures ten times sharper and confirmed it was just a natural landform. Once again in April 8, 2001 Nasa proved that it was not a an alien sculpture once again. Garvins said " it reminded him the most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." Once again proving that it was not a alien made sculpture.

People still might believe that it was an alien made sculpture. But multiple times it has been checked and everytime it was checked with a better camera. Multiple Nasa teams went through checking this out and still proved it to be a landform.
