On Mars we have discovered a landmark that seems to resemble a face. Some believe it was made by aliens. People believe this because of how much it resembles a human face. However they do not have evidence to back that up.

Scientists can prove that their claims are inaccurate. They can prove this because, there is landmarks like this in the Midwest of America. Scientists belive that it was just another Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia. The only difference was this one had unusual shadows which caused others to believe it was made by aliens.

Astronauts from NASA went back up again to get another picture. They had took a good picture. Although peoplethat believed it was made by aliens argued it was a cloudy picture. NASA sent another mission up into space to prove them wrong once again. They took a picture on a clear day and still found no proof that it was alien made. This time they used a better camera so people who believed could not say it was because of the picture this time.

In conclusion you can't prove that it was alien made. Scientists have proven again and again that aliens did not make the Mesa. It may look as if someone, or something has made it but that did not happen. It is just an odd shaped Mesa like the ones in the Midwest.
