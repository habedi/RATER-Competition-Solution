Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students do need cell phones at school at some occasions. But, phones are distracting during class and should not be allowed during classes. You should enforce Policy 1, let students bring phones to school, but make them turn the phones off during class, because if you enforce Policy 2, not let students have phones in school at all, students may need phones but won't be allowed to have them.

In times of emergency, students may need to call their parents, the police, the fire department, or other people while in school. With Policy 1, students would be able to take their phones out, turn them on and make a call. But, with Policy 2, students won't be able to make any calls and things could be very bad. Letting students use their phones during lunch or any free blocks will not hurt that student or other student's studies and should be allowed. However, students should not be allowed to use phones while in the library. The downside to Policy 1 is that students may try to use their phones during class, but you should instruct teachers to confiscate any phones that they see on during class.

I hope you agree with me on my choice of phone policies and that you do enforce Policy 1. It would help students and any other people in the school if students could use phones outside of class.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
