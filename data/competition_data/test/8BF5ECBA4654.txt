In the text " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the aurthor tells the reader allot about Venus. From the temperature to how close it is to earth. " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid". This shows that the aurthor is supporting his text wioth facts by giving the reader an idea of what Venus is like. " Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us". In this paragraph the aurthor lets the reader know that there has been scientist and Astronomers that tried to land on Venus but they werent successfull because of the dangers on Venus. It also shows that because the scientest couldnt do this it wanted them to want to do it even more.
