Dear Principal,

The two terms given are policies that both have reasonable pros and cons to each subject. Allowing students to bring phones to school and obligating them to use such devices during lunch periods and free times as long as the phones are off during teaching periods is one possibility. On the other hand, banning cell phones from school at any time and at any hour is another choice.

Although these policies hold different views and opinions to them, letting students carry cell phones in school should be authorized.

In any case of an emergency, students who are allowed to have a cell phone during lunch breaks and other free time can contact those in times of an emergency. Parents have always been concerned of the fact that in times of genuine trouble, they are not able to reach their child. Lock downs and fires are always a huge possibility during school and parents always stress that they must be the first to know the condition of their child. In case of any emergency, a student can call for help using a cell phone, arousing the awareness of others, such as teachers and students.

In addition to emergencies, schools that let students hold cell phones show a basis of trust and understanding of the student's predicament. Trust is an immense foundation that children need to learn to have and form with other individuals in society today. By letting students realize that they can be trusted, they themselves will show more respect and credence towards adults. To be responsible in life is a goal that each individual must achieve. Starting with trust, students will learn to be responsible. Their understanding of the rules and regulations that go along with privileges will be made clear and those who break such rules will face the necessary consequences.

Allowing cell phones in school during appropriate times is not necessarily a necessity, but a privilege that should be given to responsible students. For emergency purposes, the use of cell phones may lessen any casualties during schools hours. As a life goal, our community must instill trust with each other and hold the responsibilities with such privileges.

Therefore, the first step is to allow cell phones in school for the use of rational purposes only during specified times.

Sincerely,
