In the picture that you were showen looks like a face on Mars that many people believe was created by Aliens, Scientist call the face "Face of Mars". "Face of Mars" has been a pop icon, it has starred in many films, books, radio shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for over 25 years!

Many people believe this "face" has been created by aliens because of how far it it and how barley visible it is, would this prove that there is Human life on Mars? many people believe that their is human life on mars but some people are skeptics. I truly believe that this is just a natural landform. Some believe, like scientists figure it was rock forming and had unusual shadows that made it look like an illusion with a human head, eyes, nose, and a mouth. Authors have reasoned it is a good way to get attention to mars, which has worked. There are three different photos from seperate years that show a face but you can clearly see the face has slowly dissapeared by 1998, by 2001 the face looks like it has faded slowly. Nasa scientists were starting to dissagree at some point but that is okay, people have there own way of beliveing stuff. Most scientists on Nasa believe it has been natural rock formation over the years, they seem to be pretty positive. most scientists like to keep information to their selves instead of saying infromation to conspiracy theorists which can give false information.

Natural Landforms are common around the American West, it makes more sense to prove that it is just natural rock landform coming together forming rock and the shadow illusion of a face, as scientists predict. As many more years come around there might be more information about the "Face of Mars".
