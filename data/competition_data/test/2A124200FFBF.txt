Schools out! Summer time! Summer projects?!? I'm sure that's not what kids think about during their summer break. Being a kid that has had many summer projects I can say from a students point of view that when it's finally summer time I forget about school and summer projects. Summer is time for the brain to take a break from studying, projects, and tests. However, teachers have the job of making sure that we can take a break but not forget all the knowledge retained throughout the whole year. They are in charge of getting us ready for the next year and new knowledge. A students top priority is not worrying about the next year and how to keep their mind ready to retain new information. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because some students are not mature enough, old enough, or knowledgeable enough yet to designed the projects to prepare them for the next year.

Although some high school students are mature enough to know what's best, most aren't. High schoolers range from ages 14-18 and people mature at many different times in life. If I had the decision of designing my summer project I would make it easy so that I had more time to relax rather than do school work. That would not prepare me at all for my next year of schooling. However, if my teacher made the assignment then I would do it the way she asks it to be done. Even though I consider myself more mature than a lot of kids in my school I am still just a kid. I am, however, still mature enough to admit it, the fact that I would design my project easier, because I do want a good education for myself. Teachers designing the projects would benefit the students because most students aren't mature enough yet.

Summer projects that are assigned to elementary and middle school students would need to be designed by their teacher because younger kids don't see the importance at such a young age. I talked a lot about high schoolers but they aren't the only ones getting summer projects assigned to them. I can speak from experience that before I was going into high school I didn't even get why I needed to learn half the stuff they were trying to teach me. I was too unintelligent. This is why I speak to the fact that some students aren't old enough to see the importance of keeping your brain thinking over the summer break.

Students aren't knowledgeable enough yet to know what to put on their school projects. Summer projects are assigned to students by the curriculum of their classes for the next year. Therefore, if a student is put to the task of designing their own summer project for their classes next year they wouldn't have enough knowledge to do the right thing for their project. The teachers would be the most helpful in creating the project for the students to do before school the next year. However, if the teachers made guidelines for the project and what was needed on it then that could work.

All in all, teachers designing the summer projects would be more beneficial towards the students due to students not being mature, old, or in the know enough. Summer projects are more of a priority for teachers than students during summer. Although, they are still needed for the student to prepare for the next year.
