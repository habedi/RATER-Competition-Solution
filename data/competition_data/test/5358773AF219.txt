Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It think you should allow policy number one. It think you should allow policy one, because students get bored in recess, they use it to have a social life in school, and they can use it on their free time just in case there is an emergency. Some students like to use their phones in recess, so they will stay out of trouble and be calm. Also a phone is used to be socialized in school, to the drama, fights, and other stuff updated. The phone is used also in case of emergency's, like if you where to ripe your pants or something like that would you like to walk all the way to the office just to call home. Or just take your phone out your pocket and call home in 30 seconds? It think i would just like to call home in 30 seconds. See this is why i think you should let policy one happen. at other school's students have no problem with this policy as long as students use it for accurate things. I know you don't want to bring this policy back, because sometimes students use them during their learning time, to record fights in classrooms, and to text their friends when there like right next to each other. If you can trust us this one time we promise you that we will won't take advantage of this privilege. I hope you change your mind, and allow this policy one more time!
