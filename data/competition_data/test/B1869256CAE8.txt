Dear, principal

I think you should consider letting the students have their cell phones out during free time or lunch time. I think it would let the student feel better about school, and make them want to come more. It would also make the students more interested in school. Letting the students have free time with their cell phones would also help them focus more on their school work after letting them have their free time.

Students that cannot use their cell phones during all school hours are just going to use their cell phone behind the teachers back any so why don't you just let them have their time with their cell phones during school, Then in return they will give you time to teach them and let them learn. I Think that this would be a better change for the students and the teachers. It's the education we care about right? So when making this policy Available Would make the student care about coming to learn at school while they can always know they will have fun at school.

You should really consider this change in school. If you want smarter and better kids of the future then you will make this change. Education is our main goal. Make the change know. It' better for everyone. It's now or never.
