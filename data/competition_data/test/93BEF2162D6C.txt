There is some consensus of when it comes to if student should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Although some people think student should not take online clasess, neverthless, there is some people who agrees with that situation in education. Because, the online clasess are time limit so they can use their time wisely in other things and student who have to face transportation problem every morning, clasess from home will make their life more easier.

To bging taking online clasess from home is much more valuable because those clasess are time limited, so that student can use their other time wisely. For example, usually online clasess have seseaons which is fixed time. One course must have to be done by that seseaon time. In that case student can plan their study in a day and do a job in their free time. In USA most of the student have to take loan to finish thier education. So doing a job while taking an online course will help a lot with those loan terms. Clearly, it is binificial to take online clasess and agree with the offer of distance learning.

Farthermore, student who do not have own transportation, online clasess are the best option for them. For instance, in USA it is a big problem for people who do not have own transportation. Most of the time its the student who suffers most. Every single morning they have to rush for public transportation to go to the campus so that they will not get late for class. Some time it effects thier attendence, depends on institute and thier professors. This proves that taking an online class solve most of those problems easily. And student will be able to focuse on study more than handeling little problems like those, which is alomost turning into a part of their daily life.

Overall, it is much more imprtent that taking a class online saves time and let student do other jobs to earn enough and a oportunity for them to be on time when there is a possiblity of being late to the class only because of transportation problem. This shows that student should attend clasess from home by way of online or vedio conferencing and accept the offer of distance learning.
