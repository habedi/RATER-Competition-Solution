Dear Principal:

The policy change is unfair and unhealthy for the children who do not hold a B average. This will make it difficult for them to stay in shape and to stay healthy. A lot of children stay in on there commuters, watch t. v and don't get the right amount of exercise. School activities make shore that these children get the amount of exercise to keep them at least healthy and active.

Yes, this policy might make children motivated to increase there average, but some children fiscally or mentally can not. This policy puts presser on these children and will most likely make them feel left out or that they have a low learning ability.

I do not feel that these consequences are necessary to get your point across. There are other ways to enhance the B average level that do not have consequences like these. You could require teachers to stay and work with the children who have a lower average than most separately from the rest of the children on certain times or days. So as you can see this policy should be changed and rethought due to the reasons in this letter. Thank you, and i hope you recon sitter this policy change.
