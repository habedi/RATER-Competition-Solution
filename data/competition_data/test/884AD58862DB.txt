Car -Free Cities cars cars cars everyone in the world wants a car to themselves since now they are cheap and easy to manufacture but all those cars emmit poisonous fumes causing a green house effect ( over heating of the planed due to heat not able to escape) has any one imagined about one's life without cars ?

i can say i have cars are one of the major lazyness causing mashines one now a days drives 3 blocks to the gym to work out why not leave the car and jog/ walk there you'll get more fit and the environment would be a slight less poluted if everyone stops driving cars for a short distace and take a bike or take a walk it would affect the environment positively.

now here is a city that lives on without cars the city is VAUBAN and its in Germany. street parking, driveways and home garage parking is generally forbidden is experimental district. owning cars is allowed though you'll have to buy a space worth  $40,000 Ö_o now thats a lot of money just to park you car !!

As result 70 % of people dont own cars and 57% sold their to move there one of the residents Herdrun Walter said "when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," so folks of you want to live in citu without cars thets a place to go.

did you know paris had banned driving cars due to the smog and the pollution  caused by the blamed disel emmition as the tax policy favors disel over gasoline miking it 67% of vehicles in france  compared to 53.3%  rest of west europe  if you diver you were fined $31 typically paris har the highest particulate matter in the air to be precise 147 a lot higher than Brussels -124 and london- 79.7 and paris  rivlled  to beijin, china one of the most polluted cities in the worled in pollution amounts.

To counter act that people of BOGOTA, Columbia are celebarting a car free day where people walk,bike, hike or skated to work violator were fined $25 despite the rain the people still did not use cars and participated in the car free day this has been going on from the mid 1900s and the city has seen constructions of 118 mile bicycle paths in many latin american cities.
