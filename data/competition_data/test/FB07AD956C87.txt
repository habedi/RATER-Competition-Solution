Every student has dreamed about the idea of attending classes at home. Unconditionally, this very thought has already been emphasized ever since the invention of homework. Now, with the advancement in computers and technology, homework can be transformed into classwork that students can do throughout the day from the bed they sleep on. Many benefits are offered to both students and teachers when using online videos and conferencing for students at home. Almost every student has online access, encouraging sick and injured students to still do work at home without missing class time. Though a few problems exist with attending class from home, the benefits ultimately outweigh the negatives.

With current day technology, students have access to the internet almost everywhere they go. With the introduction of

Google's Chromebook more than 5 years ago ,

students are able to use their schools laptop for completing online work at their house. This encourages the idea that students don't need to have a phone or a home computer in order to complete work online. Even with no internet at home, students have the ability to go to the library to get free public WiFi. Thanks to another Google based website;

Google Classroom is a website where teachers can create private online classes where they upload classwork and other useful information students can view via an invitation code to the class. With a site like

Google Classroom, students have an extremely high chance of doing online work without much hassle, such as needing hard copies of the missed classwork and lessons. Theoretically speaking, hundreds of millions of students around the world already do this. This enchances the idea of "Online Classwork" instead of just "Online homework, which many of us are already familiar with.

Additionally, the incredible online accessiblity grants students who are sick, injured, or missed school because of snow days, the option to do work online. When students are sick or injured, they are highly advised to stay at home. This brings up the still occuring problem of missing assignments and lessons. By offering online lessons and assignments, these students are able to complete their classwork without being behind and having F's put in for assignments, even with an excused absence. Furthermore, if school is cancelled because of snow or even the spreading of the Coronavirus, teachers have the ability to assign online work to their students. Teachers also have the ability to post videos of the lessons, which may help the students in need. With that added benefit, both students and teachers have less work to worry about. This introduces the idea of saving time. With the addition of online lessons and classwork, students and teachers are being granted the ability to not miss a certain unit or lesson, limiting many students from falling behind on classwork and other assignments.

However, there are a few negatives that come to play when it comes to online conferencing and classwork. As many adults are aware of by now, laziness is common amongst many teens. Students who don't feel like completing their online work will instead: play video games, hang out with friends, or do non-educational activities. While this is completely up to the student, online assignments can be brushed off and seen as useless if given many opportunities to fix that mistake. Along with laziness, students are more capable of cheating by looking up answers or asking friends whether or not they have completed certain online assignments. This limits students from learning and not taking classwork seriously, which possibly limits their potential of passing future tests. If a student does not understand an assignment they are doing even if their teacher uploaded a video of a lesson, the student will need to schedule a time to have a video conference with their teacher. This can be a problem due to the teacher being unavailable until a certain time, or unvailable the whole day.

Even with the few added negatives of attending online classes from home, students are offered the ability to keep their grades up by doing school work online at home. Teachers can also save their time chasing down a student for missing assignments as long as the student is able to complete their work online. In conclusion, attending classes from home is a great idea for students in need, as they get the opportunity to complete their assignments without hassle, stay on top of class lessons, and save both their and their teachers time.
