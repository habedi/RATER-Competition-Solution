I disagree with the principal because most people can not do extracurricular activities, because they do not like the activities that are given to them or they do not like working with others, or they are overweight and can not do any sort of exercise most overweight people can barely run, or walk without breathing hard/ heavy but to be clear i am over weight but i can walk a decent distance without breathing heavy i can run for like 5 or 8 laps to be honest but back to the prompt, then there are people that are skinny but do not want to do anything and they do not like socializing with anybody they only want to be alone thats kind of what i do but i socialize from every now and then but we should not have to do extracurricular activities because the principle wants us to it should always be our decision and only ours and the principal should just respect that.

in my personal opinion we should always have a choice on what to do like if we want a tattoo or if we want to quit school the decision should always be up to us no matter what anybody says it is our life we shape our own path to destiny, and we may need the help of others on the way and that is just fine okay because everybody needs help in life even i do with somethings like i need help with my math, and i need help with my science because math and science confuse me now because math involves letters now and science i never really got but most people get everything about these 2 subjects but not me, and that is why i ask for help because we all need it like some people need help with sleeping or getting up, it is an odd process to me but to be honest but we need to have our own choices and our own say in the matter that everyone should hear and then voice their opinion, that is what we need to do now we could put it up to a vote but I'm absolutely certain that everyone will vote no to being forced to do extracurricular activities because, nobody wants to and if the principal does not agree they can suck it up because they got outvoted and that means the people have spoken that is what the majority of the students have voted on because, it is their right to make their own decisions and do what they want to do and everyone should respect that in my opinion and if they do not then say i do not care it is my opinion not yours and thats that and they can not say no to everybody's opinion, they might say it to 5 or 10 people but not all of the people and thats the beauty of the world because this is how the voting system works and it is a great system that we should not change it at all it has gotten us a lot of good presidents and a lot of great senators but the voting system got us my favorite president john f Kennedy, he was one of the best presidents for like 2 years then he got assassinated that was a pretty sad day i felt bad for his wife, but still the voting system is almost flawless so we should keep improving it and not get rid of it because i think getting rid of it a long time ago would have been crazy and we would have not ended up with the type of system we are stuck with today.
