Many times we as humans study things that have been studied hundreds of times. Amost like we think the we might be able to prove the findings wrong or something. Why don't we study things that no has ever studied before? Why don't we try to strive for more. The only reason why Pluto is not a planet no longer is cause we know there is more planets beyond.

Venus is one of the things that we really have never studied. Even though the odds are greatly against humans with a extremely hot 800 degree surface, and much more we should try to create a space craft that could reach and survive the elements. Spend time in the lab, andtry to find a new material that could with stand the elements.

We had flew to the moon hundreds of times, and circled the sun many times to. Expand the possiblities, and raise the bar on what the human raise can do. Challlenge ourselves, and expand dreams and knowledge. Make another planet possible if we ever do need to leave planet Earth!
