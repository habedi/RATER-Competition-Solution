Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. in the fourth paragraph it says venus is the most like our solar system. "long ago, venus was probably coverd largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth". i believe scientests should go to venus or at least try. if they can get there and study the planet, we will find out new stuff. what if scientists figure out there can be life forms in the planet. that would mean we could have a whole new world. in paragraph 5 it says "The national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) had sent a human to venus". when they sent that person he/she survied. "not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. every day people are studying this planet. i think maybe one day people will be able to live on venus and that venus might be our new planet. this is why i think studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
