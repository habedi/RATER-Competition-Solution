Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that community service would be a good idea. It would help people out that are less fortunate then us. It would help elderly people or people that can't do much. It would also maybe help us learn about how lucky we actually are to have a house, and clothes, and food to eat everyday.

It would be a good idea but a lot of people wouldn't wanna do it. So if you made it small things or things that didn't take a lot of time to do then it would probably work. And maybe like each month if you got a certain amount of hours or did a certain amount of things then you could get a prize. I think more people would do that if they knew they could get a prize.

Plus you shouldn't tell the kids when they have to do it, you should let them pick because a lot of kids have sports like me. And when i get out of practice I'm tired so I would not wanna have to do community service. And a lot of kids are busy so letting them decide when to do it would be a good idea. And that would encourage more people to do it.

We could do such things as rake leaves, shovel snow, help out elderly people with needs, or even pick up trash on the road. We could even do things here in our school like help stack books in the library, help pick up trash in the hall ways, or even help clean up the lunch room on Fridays like some people do.

In conclusion I think it would be a good idea and many people would benefit from this. I think that it would also change our lives as well as many people that we would be helping. We would also be making our community a better place to live in and many people would be thankful for our help.
