There are several advantages in limiting car usage. It helps the environment, lowers the chance of crashing, removes stress, and also congestion.

A reason why limiting car usage is beneficial is that it helps the environment. In source 2, France reached several days of "near-record pollution". This is mainly because of the substantial numbers of cars in France. Since France is dependent more on Diesel rather than gasoline, it emits more pollution causing smog to be more evident. In paragraph 14, it states, "...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.". China has far more than triple the population of France. Yet, France is able to reach the same level of smog as China. If an abundant amount of people continue to drive cars as the way they do, every country is going to have the smog problem Beijing and France are having. Also possessing so much smog is a safety hazard being that it limits your ability to see from a distance.

In addition, limiting car usage can reduce stress. In source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said " When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.". In source 3, Carlos Artuto Plaza quotes " its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution". It is not only one person who can vouch on the reduction of stress by limiting car usage. A woman in Germany and a man in Colombia can both agree on the idea that limting car usage reduces stress. When you dont drive a car as much you have less things to worry about. Like, Fearing the possibilty of crashing, running out of gas, dealing with traffic, and several more problems. If someone drives less you would have less stress (in theory). The idea of stress reduction is an amazing advantage someone recieves if they limit their car usage.

Reducing car usage can also lower congestion. In source 2, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after 5 days of intensyfying smog...". The implication of limited car usage brought the congestion down 60 percent. That is a major advantage since there is a decrease in the number of cars on the streets. This reduces traffic and allows people to reach their destination sooner than they would if it was more congested. The drop in congestion means that there are less cars on the streets so there would be a lesser chance of crashing. This is a factor that can reduce stress. The reduction of congestion is a positive product of the limitation of car use.

In closing, the limitation of car usage gives the advantage of aiding the environment, reducing the likelihood of crashing, stress, and congestion.
