The Face of Mars

The face on Mars has grown popularity over the idea of exterterrestrial life on mars. The face on Mars has many scientists taking sides if the face is exterrterestrial life or is it a rock land formation. Conspiricy theorys are spreading that NASA is hiding something from the public. Why would NASA hide anything about the face if it would fund NASA to grow and explore more, NASA has made 2 trips to identify what the face really is and both trips they ave come to the conclusion that it is a rock, There are few scientists that actually believe that it is exterterrestrial life.

Why is NASA being accused of hiding something from the public if they would benefit from discovering something that has to do with exterterrestial life? The Conspiracuy theories are ridiculous and it is completly idiodic to think that people would hide something if they wold benifit from it. NASA has also made 2 trips to prove that it is a rock foramtion on the suface and not exterrterrestrial life. NASA has researched the face and proved that is is a rock formation because it is similar to the land formation here on earth. There are also few scientists that believe the face is exterterrestrial life. The scientists that work for NASA have studied the face and it has been scientifically proven that the face is a rock formation.

The face is a rock landform but I could see why NASA would keep it a secret if it wasn't a rock landform. NASA might keep it a secret to avoid mass panic throughout the world, but that is very unlikely that it would be alien life because we have similar land formation to the face on Mars. The conspiricy theorys are ridiculous because NASA wouldnt hide that because it would benefit them and their space program and would earn money to adventure further into space and have better technology.
