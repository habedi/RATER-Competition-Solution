i think this should be a thing because it would help people work when on a computer. it would help people becasue it would make them more enjoyable for the person that is working. it would help because if th user is not satisified by the way a lession is performing the computer would know that an change the application to make it more interesting to the spicific user. also it would be diffrent for everybody and everyone has a diffrent way of learning certain things. doing this would make studfence preform better because th appilication that they are using conforms to them specifically. the only bad thing about this is that some people would say that it is invading peoples thoughts and that it should not be able to know everything down to emotions in a person. the othe rthing wrong with this is that we dont have the capeability to have that in the common computers that we have today , simply because they would have to be way bigger just to have the space to hold all the facial recognition codes for every emotion. those are the reasons i think that facial recognition in a school computer would be helpful.
