Dear The Principal,

Most students here at SCHOOL_NAME

would enjoy to use there phones. I think it would be a great idea to let students use there phones during passing periods, lunch, and any free time in class, as long as the teacher allows it. A couple of reasons i think it is a good idea is because if we are not in class then what is the point. Around campus i see kids using there phones anyways, most students don't even listen to the rules about no cell phone at school. And another thing what if there is an emergency at home and your parents need to get a hold of you. Most kids text at lunch so u should just allow it.

At our school there is always a lot of kids using there phones even if there not aloud to. If you deicide to let students use there phones then they wont be worrying about getting in trouble. I think there would be less stress on kids because even though they are using there phones they would not have them out during class. But letting kids use there phones when they are not even in class is a good idea. Its not like they would be distracted because they would not be doing anything.

Lets take an example, lets say there is an emergency at home and your family has to go the emergency room. So, they cant pick you up from school. They need to tell you that you are going home with your neighbor. But since they cant get a hold of you how would you find this out? Instead of spending many hours waiting for your parents to come get you, you can be at home watching tv, or hanging out with your friends. And then your parents wont be worried that you didn't get their message.

I have witnessed that during lunch most kids use their phones to text anyways. Most kids just look out for teachers or have their friends cover them up. If students aren't going to follow the rules anyways then what is the point of having those rules. most students believe that the rule about cell phones is stupid. They just disobey and still get away with it. It is also not fair when the teachers pull there phone out in the middle of class and start texting the loved ones.

As you can see i strongly agree that cell phones should be allowed at school. All students should have the right to use there phones during passing periods, lunch, and any spare time in classes. As long as the teacher allows it. I think this is a very good idea and should be unforced at all schools.

Thank You for your time,

Student
