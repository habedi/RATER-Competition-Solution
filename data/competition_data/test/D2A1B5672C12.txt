Dear principal,

Many students enjoy playing sports and/or taking part in other activities.

However, not many students enjoy school or working hard.

Students sometimes skip homework and paying attention and instead, focus on other things such as sports, activities, or hanging out with friends.

I believe that requiring at least a grade B average to take part in sports and activities is a reasonable idea because a grade B average is not that difficult to get or maintain, it will boost scores and the knowledge of students at our school.

A grade B average is not a very difficult goal to reach.

It is easier than a grade A average but still harder than a grade C average, providing a challenge for the students.

The students will have a great incentive for wanting to get grades and will work very hard to be able to reach that grade B average.

A grade B average is just an average, meaning that the student doesn't need to have an A in every class to get it.

With this in mind, the students will realize that this is possible and a reasonable policy.

This new policy will greatly benefit the students at our school.

Almost all students love sports or activities with their friends.

With almost all students aiming for a B average, the students will be studying harder and really pushing to get higher grades.

This means that the school will receive a better overall grade average and will rank higher amongst other schools in the state and country.

Students will become smarter from studying and paying attention more in class leading to higher student knowledge and understanding.

In the long-term, the students will have a better understanding of every subject and will grow up to be smart and have bright futures.

A grade B requirement policy will be a wise choice and prove very beneficial to both the school and the students.

The school will be recognised more and receive higher rankings than other schools around the country.

The students will learn double or even triple than other students in the state and country.

Students can mature to be wise and strong-minded adults and could make a name for themselves out in the world.

Having high level businessmen or scientists or mathematicians coming from our school will boost student enrollment and fame for the school.

I believe that this is a fair and very possible requirement for all students at our school.

Sincerely,

Student
