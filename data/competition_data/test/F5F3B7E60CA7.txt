Cars may have some advantages, but the world, would be a better place if we limited car useage. The benifits of limiting our usage of cars is, it will help improve the enviornment, there are healthy alternitves, and not useing cars as much will decrease stress that people have.

Decreasing our car usage will emprove the environment. In the artical "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, he says " Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."  In France they banned even numbered liscence plates from driving, for one day, and one day was all it took for the high levels of smog to decrease. In another Artical "The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal it talks about the decrease usage of cars throught the years, paragraph 34 says " If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment." If the people keep slowing down on using cars, which scientist believe it will, there will be better carbon e,issions in the air, and the air will be better. Limiting car usage will help make our environment better.

Walking, biking, and skateing are all excercises that help you stay fit, but they are also a healthy alternative to cars. A artical published in the

Seattle Times called "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky describes the day that is trending all over the world, the day cars are banned. People in these countries, in this case Colombia "hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work" Banning car usage enchourages people to get up and walk, run, or bike because they can't use their car. In the town Vauban, Germany a car free town, people walk everywhere, because the town has no cars. In the town "...where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor." The people in this town are walking and staying fit everyday.

One last benifit of limited car usage is it causes people less stress. Heidrun Walter , a mother of two who lives in Vauban, Germany, says " When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now." Once Walter sold her car she was relived, she didn't have to worry about making her next car payment, when she would have to get gas again, or how much money gas was. Getting rid of her car relived her stress. Not using cars will decrease the amount of stress in society.

Over all, limiting are car usage would greatly benifit us, it will help keep the environment clean, keep our people healthy, and it will cause people less stress.
