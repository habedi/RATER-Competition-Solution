Dear Principal,

As a student here at SCHOOL_NAME, I feel all students should be required to perform community service. I have a couple reasons why i feel that way, and I hope you consider them when you decide.

Most people to not realise how easy they have it. Our society is filled with people who only think of themselves and not how to benefit everyone. By performing community service it will give each of us a chance to realise how important it is for everyone to contribute to our community. It will give each student a chance to gain responsibility in our lives!

Another reason why I feel that we should do community service is there are many people who give up there own time to help others. If we do that it just shows how selfless our generation can be! If we participate in community service, we will have gratitude that we did not before to things we just took advantage of in the past. We each will be able to say we helped out with something big! Our community is the reason why each of us live the way we do and we all should participate in it!

I do hope that you realise that performing community service will better each of us in the future in the fact that we will be more responsible, be selfless, have gratitude, and pride! Thank you, for listening to my opinion!
