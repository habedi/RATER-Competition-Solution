Dear,

Mr Principle

Some of the students and i have been thinking it is not fair that we cannot play sports i have a c grade and i do all my work in class and is never getting in trouble i think it is not fair i think you put that you need a b to play sports i think you should change it to failing because many students work hard to get there grades when other students have it handed to them also behavior should be part of it to because many students have been very bad and others have been good all year so TEACHER_NAME i think it is not fair and i think your should change it many students are very respect full when it comes to staff member's and others are disrespectful and that should be put into play at our middle school so TEACHER_NAME can you please change the rules a little also when it comes to activities i don't think we need good grades thank you and one more thing other people make a mesh and other people have to clean it up that is also not fair thank for taking the time to read this.

From, STUDENT_NAME
