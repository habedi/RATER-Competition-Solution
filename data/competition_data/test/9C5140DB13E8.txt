Dear TEACHER_NAME;

Imagine if a student has the best grades and is the most outgoing and logical student. She has just got excepted to Harvard Law school program but is unable to go because she has no community service records. Community service is very important because you are supposed to give back to your community and help out once in a while. Also it is the right thing to do because you feel good about yourself after it's over. I think all kids no matter what their grades are should perform community service because it is important for our futures. Kids have way to much free time, kids get in trouble when there not watched and its great for collage.

It is very important that kids perform community service because kids have way to much free time. Yeah there is your athletes who play five different sports but test have proven that two out of ten kids play sports. The other eight sit around and do nothing. The problem with doing nothing in this society is that kids have way to much access. Most kids have had facebook since sixth grade and get in a lot of trouble for it. Other kids sit home all day and play up to thirty hours worth of video games in one week. That is crazy because x-box and wii are not teaching you anything about the real world. Community service shows you have important it is to give back to people who have less then you do. Studies show that the worst thing that kids do after school is watch television. Most kids watch up to sixty hours worth of television each week. I highly doubt the Kardashians and Jersey Shore are teaching us the importance of helping our community.

Also kids get in trouble that is a natural thing in life kids get in trouble for fighting and cheating, but never smoking. Smoking for middle school's have gone up 20% since last year. Kids feel like they have nothing better to do in their lives so they just try a cigarette or even worse marijuana. But if kids donated more and helped out their community the number would go down dramatically from last year. Also, we are kids we make mistakes but so we don't make the same mistakes as the homeless people we need to learn how hard it is the make a living an do work, and this will teach us. I got in trouble last year for cheating on a test and instead of yelling at my mom took me to the homeless shelter and showed me how I was going to end up if I cheat and don't learn the information. I swore from that moment on that I would never cheat again, and I haven't. My mom scared me into studying and that is exactly what these kids need.

Lastly, community service looks great on a collage recommendation. My cousin didn't get into Princeton, Harvard or Yale because she didn't have a collage recommendation because community service wasn't required in her school. I know in our grade about 30% of kids aren't going to collage because they don't feel like they earned it and they don't feel good enough. That number can go down only if community service is required. Community service is not just helping clean up garbage or helping out in a soup kitchen, it could change someone's life. One of us could change a life forever but that is only if you agree to make community service mandatory in this school. I understand that kids are busy playing sports and in other activities. But that doesn't mean kids can't take one Saturday a month to help the community. I ask you TEACHER_NAME what do you think is the right choice to make?

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
