Dear State Senator,

I think our country should choose the president by popular vote. So the people get the president they think is the best for the job. But to do this we will need people motivated to go and vote. Because not many people normally go and vote during the election. or any election for that matter.

It will help with the problem of canidates going to a certain state to get the votes. But they can just go to densly populated areas. The flip to that though is they will need to spend more time convincing and/or explaining what they will do in office. Even if we need to find a way to break a tie if a tie happens with popular vote.

The only way to fix the Electoral College vote is not all of one states vote goes to a canidate that way they can't abuse the strategy of going to the states with more votes.

From your sender,
