Would you make a choise to do the Seagoing Cowboys program? Well if I were Luke I wouldn't go beacuse there are alot of other things he could do. He could stay in his home town and do the job he already has.

If I went I wouldn't be able to see my family every day. I like to have an oportunity to see my family a lot like you do most of the time. We go play cards and go out to eat all the time. When you aren't with your family for a while, don't you get scared? I like my family and I have them by my side to help me with what I need.

If I went on the trip and started a job on there, I could probly make more money than working at a store. It would help me with things like getting a new car because I would have a lot more money. I could make a lot of money but it is a dangerous job. I could die from it if something goes wrong with the boat or if I fall off the side of the boat. Would you really risk your life just to make more money and buy nicer things for my family? I know I wouldn't.

If I were on the boat, I wouldn't have much of anything to do. I would have my friend but what could I do with my friend. I would be awake while my friend would be asleep. If we were up at the same time we couldn't plat football or anything like that. So that means we couldn't do a lot of things to do together.

After thinking about it I still wouldn't chose to go on the Seagoing Cowboys program. Think about all the things I talked about. I wouldn't be able to see your family. I can probly make more money but risk your life. I can't do anything on the boat. So I would not chose to go on that trip.
