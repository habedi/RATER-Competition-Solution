Phones and Driving

Should people be allowed to have a cell phone when driving is a no. I don't think that people should have one on them when driving. People already have a hard time staying off they phones without driving a car, they are already many cases of texting and driving, and lastly people who would be texting and driving would not just risk the lives of themselves but for other people as well.

People already have a hard time staying off they phones without being on the road. Any noise or vibration that they phones makes people stop everything just to look to see what's on they phone. While on the road, people should put they phones on silent mode to stop them from being distracted when driving. They are also other free apps that people can download to help stop them from looking at they phones.

They are many of police reports about people getting into bad/life threatening accident. It is a proven fact that 11 teens each day from texting and driving. It's also a proven fact that 9 out of 10 accidents on the road are caused by people not paying attention to the road. People that are on they phones when driving are not only putting they lives at risk, they are putting the other people on the road, people in the car with them, and also putting who are walking down the road also.

The people how would be texting and driving are not just risking their lives, they are also risking other people around them. When are not paying attention to the road and the people around them they tend to more accidents. They are many causes of people not paying attention when driving and then hitting somebody else's car.

That's why being on your phone when driving isn't safe for people who already have a phone problem, the people who have already had accidents when driving should have learned the first time, and lastly when driving and on a phone puts a lot of other peoples lives at risk.
