To the Principle,

What is community service? It is an outwardly showing of concern for the place that we live and care about. But it is much more than that. It is a way to show that we care about our community and the people in it. A way to better our lives and the lives of others by sacrificing our time. And although community service is wonderful way to show awareness of others and to better our world, it should not be made mandatory.

All communities, whether in intercity New York or rural Kansas, matter to the people who live there. And it is out of the goodness of their hearts that they use their time to improve the lives of other citizens. Making community service required, you would not only rob the students who perform it on their own of the self-satisfaction they get from serving their country, but make helping our nation more of a chore for those who are forced to do it.

Strong communities make for a strong nation. And if you see that there is a need for more community service work, I encourage you to motivate your students. Make community service fun! Have food drives for the needy. Set up dinners for the homeless hosted by the school. Initiate peer tutoring programs to help students with special needs. With programs such as these in place, you will see that your students will begin to motivate themselves and each other to continue this service. By giving your students the means to help others, you will not only start them on the path to helping others into adulthood, but give them the feeling that they are contribut to make a brighter tomorrow.

Sincerely,
