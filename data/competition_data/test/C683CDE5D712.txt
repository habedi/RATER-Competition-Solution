Dear Principal

Students should not be mandated to perform a service to the community. A community service is an action performed by students voluntarily. If students are forced to take part in a community service the job that they do will be half done. If you the principal feel at least a few should do this then create a club or class where the students have a choice. As I said before the job will be half done if they are forced. I myself are a perfect example. When I am forced to do something such as daily chores, I don't give it my all. I consider my parents lucky that I do it at all. If the students are forced you may have a riot of students and parents alike.

Please consider my argument before doing anything drastic. Another little detail you might have missed was the time it takes to do the community service will rip the students from their daily after school activities like homework. The quality of their answers on their homework will drop drastically. They will have a liable excuse. The constant use of the excuse might drive the teachers to insanity. Homework is no fun for students to do so they will use this as an excuse. Community service might take away many students learning opportunities. When they don't understand a subject in school they go home to read up on the topic. With community service they don't have the time.

Sincerely yours,

A concerned pupil
