Dear principal,

I think students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school under your first policy. Students love their phones, it gives them a sense of being in touch or connected with one another while their friends are in different classes. I believe that if you give them a little more freedom with their phones, they will respect your conditions of the policy.

To them it's a privilege. And instead of them breaking the rules and causing a disruption, they will work on their assignments knowing they can talk to their peers later after class.

I take this position because usually, the students will be more joyful, and they won't feel like their in a prison with too many rules and restrictions.

They will feel like attending school more and participating. But i posses, that if they do not hon the policy of putting the cellular device away and off during class hours, their privilege's should be taken away so that they understand that they cannot manipulate your authority.

You should let students have their cell phones out during free time before and after class so they can talk to their friends, be social, and not have to wait until the day is almost over after school hours. In my point of view, if i was a student and i had an opportunity to have this policy, i would be happy and thankful that the school administrators have given this rule a look at and some thought. I would not manipulate the rule because i know it took trust from the principal that we could handle this type of responsibility.

Students will also get a taste of responsibility with their items. They will be aware of their moral obligation to follow your rules and policies.

I agree with your thought of letting students use their mobile device during free time between, before, and after school. And i hope you will grant some thought about the idea.
