To require a student to participate in activities is wrong. you probably want to know why i think its wrong, your probably thinking its a good idea that it would get kids to move more and get out of the house, but I completely disagree with it because, the student might have to help their families when they get home, they get to spend less or no time with their families, and they might participate in other activities not through the school.

The first reason it's wrong is students might have to help their families after school. For example they might have to take care of someone who is sick and cant take care of themselves or maybe a younger sibling who is to young to stay alone when their parents cant watch them. maybe they live on a farm and they have lots of chores to do like feed and walk the animals, but the activity they are being forced to do gets them home late with little or no time to do all of their chores. they get in trouble and their animals could starve and not be fed till the next day. what about another student who doesnt live on a farm but their parents work all day or all night and it really tired and has to cook clean and take care of their kids. they usually have their son or daughter to help watch their younger sibling or just to help clean and cook but the activity the principal is requiring them to do is keeping them at school, so they cant help their parent and their parents gets upset and flustered and doesnt know what to do. and thats on the principal.

secondly, the student would spend less to no time with their family. what if the student has a parent who works a lot so the only time they get to see each other is dinner, when they get home from school, or get off work, but now that they are doing an activity they never get to see each other, but not only do they not get to see each other but because the parent works a lot they dont have a ride home form what they are doing. so they have to wait on someone to come get them which could be for who knows how long this isnt fare to the student or the parent. who would have to call someone to go get their kid or to have to make a trip to a school that is completely and utterly unwanted.

And lastly, what if the student plays travel sports, they do community service or they do other stuff thats not tied to the school? Then, they would have to miss on of the activities, But just for arguments sake lets say they can do both, then everything works out right? Wrong, they would get home super late with no time to do their homework and get a zero. Or they do stay up to do the homework, they get it completely done. nothing wrong with that either? wrong again, they stayed up all night doing the homework. Now they are restless cant hold still, they cant pay attention at all, or are just going to fall asleep to get a bad grade anyway.

Forcing kids to participate in activities is wrong because, students might have to help their families, they might not spend anytime with their families, or they do stuff thats not through the school. by making these kids do activities that they probably dont want to do in the first place, you are taking away their family time, their sleep, their other activities, and lastly your taking their free time which should be theirs to waste or use productively not the principals to make them do school activities. So I'll leave you to think about it. Should the principal take these things from the students at her school?
