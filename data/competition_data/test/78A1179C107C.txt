The effect of cars in our world today has grown tremendously. As companies create new models of various cars, buyers don't often think twice about how these cars hurt the environment and cause serious global emissions. The production of "Hybrids" is the first step to solving this problem. The advantages of limiting car usage can result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community.

Pollution amounts have skyrocketed in the past several years. Due to the increase in the amount of people on the road using motor vehicles, pollution has increased and is becoming more of a threat than ever before. In Vauban, Germany, a new community has been constructed, and contains suburban pioneers that have given up their cars. They are devoted to taking public transit, such as city buses, or even personal vehicles like a bicycle. "As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here." (Car-Free Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.) The residents of this community are committed to preserving Earth by limiting their car usage to reduce pollution. Pollution is a harmful matter that can cause negative effects to an area. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States." (Car-Free Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.) When you limit the amount of time you use your car, not only does it reduce pollution, but it also saves you money, now that you are not paying a monthly fee, or taxes on the car, or for gas every month.

In the exquisite community in Vauban, Germany, many of those people have gotten rid of their car, and are now probably saving extremely high amounts of money. Between highway tolls, gas, oil changes, insurance, and the overall monthly payment on a car, these residents are saving so much money because they are not paying for all of these necessities. When they travel, they use public transit, like the city bus, which costs a fraction of what car owners pay. Paris is trying to limit the amount of individual transportation due to the smog in the area, so they made a deal. "Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC." (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) People taking public transit are saving even more money now. Due to the intense smog in Paris, and the busy streets, a limit was set for the amount of drivers allowed on the road throughout the week. "On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters...Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine." (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) Compared to the amount of money car owners spend, people without a car save a lot more money.

With the reduction of car usage, a safer community will result as well. The amounts of accidents will be substantially lower. With fewer cars on the road, the risks of car crashes greatly decrease. Many accidents result in impatience at the wheel, and careless drivers. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..." (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) Bogota, Columbia created a day for no car usage and it turned out to be a very big success, spreading across borders and leaving an impression on other countries about how limited car usage positively effects the environment. "It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines." (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.) Countries across the globe are attempting to limit car usage, and it will begin to greatly help the environments. "Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." (Source 4: The End of Car Culture.)

The effect of cars today is not a positive thing, except for hybrid cars. Countries are beginning to limit car usage and soon we will see the impact and changes in the enviromments due to car reduction. Clearly, the advantages of limiting car usage result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community.
