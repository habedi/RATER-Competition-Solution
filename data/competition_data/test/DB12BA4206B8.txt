Dear Principal,

Community service. It's what prisoners and volunteers do each and every day. Personally, I don't think you should require us students to do community service. The service takes up what free time we have to do what we need and want to do.

Imagine: kids go to school each day, full of energy, come out tired and hungry, and are then forced to more work even when they don't want too. Doesn't sound like a perfect world, huh? When we get back to our homes from school, a majority of us still have homework left to do, and on top of that, chores. After we finish all that, no other thought of work even worms its way our mind, as we have free time to text, play games, hang out with friends, or just be lazy. Taking this away would result in the failing of many students, as they would be overworked and tired.

Students aren't slaves in any how, which, where, when, or any way. There are those workers out their that could handle a full days' work, but other than that, none. Some, like myself, prefer "Brains over Brawn" in many situations. Do brains get tired? Yes, every day, but adjust quickly and form a pattern of it. Our bodies, however, can only take so much punishment. They adjust, yes, but some aren't used to as much work as others, like mowing a 40-acre backyard on a hot summer's day, 10:00 to 1:15. Half would adjust, half would leave. It's a 50/50 shot, willing to pull the trigger?

This is why community service should not be required within each student, only if they volunteer to do so.

Sincerely,

Student
