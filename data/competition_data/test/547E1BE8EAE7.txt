Howdy there partner! I'm Luke. I'm one of the Seagoing Cowboys. The first thing is you'll be getting to see are the horses and taking care of them. It's really an adventure! Being a Seagoing Cowboys, i've done nine trips and each one of them was amazing. I went to China, Greece, Italy, Europe and many other wonderful places aroud the world. Each trip was amazing! Well here's a list of what are the advantages of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

1. The Seagoing Cowboys is a corperation that gets horses from all around the world. If you join today we could make our ship bigger to carry more horses and that would mean, new horses and new people on board!

2. When your on board you'll get to take care of the horses, play games after the horses are dropped off and see the scenic view! It's an opportunity of a lifetime! But be careful, you can slide off board! I once almost slid off board, but luckily I was careful and didn't fall into the icy, cold ocean!

3. You'll get to meet new people, you'll get to explore new lands and you'll get to help new people. Plus, if we go to Venice, you'll get to go on a gondola, like me!

Well I hope you become a Seagoing Cowboy, like me! And if you do sign up, just have fun, do your work and remember, you'll have to clean up after the horses!
