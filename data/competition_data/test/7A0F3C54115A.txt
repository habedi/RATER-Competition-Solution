I think is not a good option that the students take classes from home because we need to have a social life and to meet new people everyone need to talk with someone and I think this is not good way to take classes, Some people like to take classes behind a computer but I not agree with that because they make their life boring without friends and they prefer to use their cellphone besides to talk with their family or friends

I know some people like stay in home in his phone or watch

TV but, I have some reasons why I not agree that the students take classes from home.

One reason that I do not like that students take classes from home is that they can fall in depression because they can feel alone without nobody who can they talk about their happiness or sadness also, they could not understand all the things or problems by a computer for me is more easy that a teacher can explain me what I have to do besides a machine, for example right now I have to take a class online because I want to have all my credits at the end of this semester but, I do not like to take this class from home because there are many things that I do not understand so I would like to take this class in the school because my teacher could explain my what I do not understand.

Another reason is why I disagree is because one time when i was in my country El Salvador I broke my foot and I had to take my classes from home and those months were the most worse months in my life I do not understand why many people like stay in home all day because I realized that I liked to go to school every day because I missed my friends, teacher and, my boyfriend too, but the point is that take classes from home is not a good life style for any teenagers or kids.

I have a cousin that she live in North Carolina she do not like go to school because she do not like talk with other people besides her mom and her brother she said that she would like take her classes from home but I told her that is not good idea stay all days in home because we need to share with other people and I said to her I know you are shy but you have to try to make new friends and pastime in the school because the life is not stay behind a computer or cellphone, the life is to have some funny moments with the people we love.

In conclusion I disagree that students being able to take classes from home because is not a good way to learn or have a better life only if we have some problems that we could not go to school for some reasons we can take the classes from home but if it's necessary to do it because some kids want to take their classes from home only because they do not want to share or talk with other kids and is not good for their mental healthy.
