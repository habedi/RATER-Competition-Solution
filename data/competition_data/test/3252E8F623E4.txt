How can extracurricular activites be benefical to students?

Have you ever wondered why people try excurricular activites? Extracurricular activites are often before or after school or even on the weekends. Some examples of extracurricular actiivities are sports or clubs.Â I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things.

The first reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help boost students mental health. Studies have shown that more excercise is benefical and improves overall mood. Extracurricular activitives,especially sports, have a physical component that gives students the chance to be active. Being active has shown in studies that it improves sleep cycles and overall improves mental health. Being in a extracurricular activity can help boost mental health.

The second reason why it would be benefifical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help improve social skills. Making friends doesn't come easy to everyone and joining an activity can give students the chance to meet new people. Joining an extra activity can introduce you to many people who over time, will get to know you and possibly want to become friends. Being a part of an extracurricular activity can help you meet new people and can make it eaiser to make friends or just talk to people in general. An extracurricular activity can help imporve social skills.

The third reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can give students the chance to try new things. All activites have a main focus like soccer or art club, but all activites have a little thing they do that is unique. Having the chance to be part of a club is a new thing in itself and you should take advantage of that try a new thing. Being in an extracirricular activity can give students the chance to try new things.

In conclusion, I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things. School is a chance to try new things. So take advantage of the oppurtinites that you are given to try something and see how it goes. So how can you take advantage of extracurricular oppurtinites?
