Dear Principal,

I think that the best solution for this problem is to let everyone use there phones at lunch periods or any other free time. My reason for this response is because if you don't then their just going to look at the phone when you aren't looking. A simple text message is very hard to ignore at our age and wouldn't you rather have kids doing this outside of class instead of inside class? No matter where we are, and no matter what we're doing, we are always distracted by the simple sound of a text message.

If you tell kids that they can't have they're phone in school that's like telling them they can't go to a party. And the worse thing about it is that they will give you the same response; bring the phone to school and just use it when your not looking or whenever they can. We're just going to deny your request, ignore what you say and give you problems if you or anyone else tries to confiscate it. Most of us work hard and we should be allowed to do what we like when we have free time or whenever we are finished with work.

Now we all know cell phones can be distracting must of the time but that's only because we cant look at them in school. If we even have the smallest amount of time to use with them then maybe we would be more on task. And in addition to that, if you let us use them then we wouldn't be as tempted to look at then. Just try it for at least one week and i promise you that everyone will be happier.

Sincerely,
