Driverless cars

Driverless care are a great idea for people who cant drive on their own and would like to get some wher, but has not yet came out. I think it would be a great idea if this was made legal, but its important that when will it be perfected and also we'd like to know what's keeping us from crashing.

So when will it be legal? Didn't google already start putting cars out there to driven? Well yes and no, its uncomfirmed on when will it be comfirmed that it will be legal, the governmet is manly concered about the passengers, pedestrians and lawmakers safe base off of paragragh nine. Isn't it already out ? yes it is but only had to had permission of the state and people who wanted to test it, but this is not a garranted of your safty so when will it be perfected?

In paragraph ten it is predicted that it will be near to perfect to have this proble solve in the year 2020, top of the line on most modern vechical started to join in with google on their self diving cars such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have their cars on the road on the year of 2020.

So what will it be that we're putting lives in such trust? Is it more trust worth then us are selfs? In the sense of actually yes it is. it communicate with a gps sattilte that tracks all the movement and its location in this sense its never lost, not to mention it has the beautie of motion sensers that dectect anything that lies ahead will be notice right away. keeping you away from harm based off of pragraph six.

Google is to be awatied at the year of 2020 when they release their self driving vechical and big brand names to release in the open world. the self driving car will be legal when proven to be safe to the open , and whats behind all this magic? A gps sattilte and motion sensors that dectects bizzar movent to keep us safe. We all await a better future.
