There are a lot of students that like to stay after school for extracurricular activities . Other students go home and don't even stay after school at all. I strongly disagree that students should not participate in a extracurricular activity if they don't want to. Some students have responsibilities at home for example. Taking care of a younger sibling, cleaning the house, helping their parents out, etc... but on the other hand if students are going home to play video games,not interacting with other people in the outside world then they should,because they can't be inside all day they need some fresh air and interact with other human beings.

But heres the thing students already have school for about 7-8 hours half of the time either listening to the teacher or taking a test so obviously they leave school tried and exhausted.

Many students don't even like coming to school and still show up I think if the principal forced students to join a extracurricular activity the percentage of students skipping will increase and students might not even show up to school.

We also have to think about the teachers ,you are obviously going to need a teacher to stay with the student for whatever curricular activity they get assigned to but believe it or not teachers have a life outside of school. They might have kids that they need to take care of , they might have a parttime job and they also need to look out for themselves too. What if they want to go to the gym but they can't because they have to stay after school with a couple of students so honestly it wouldn't really be fair to the teachers.

The majority of students wake up really early to go to school and when they arrive at school they are tired and exhausted so when they leave they wont be thinking about stay for an activity they will be thinking of going home and laying in bed. We all have the right to do what we want as long as its legal so as a citizen the students have a right to make the choice of joining a extracurricular activity or just going home and do whatever they want. There are many reasons why students should participate in an extracurricular activity but there are also many other reason why they shouldn't.

There for I think students should not participate in extracurricular activities because at the end of the day they are just kids and they wont have much energy after being in school for about eight hours. We should think about both teachers and stduents. I really think that students should have the choice to join a extracurricular activity or not and not have the principle choose for them.
