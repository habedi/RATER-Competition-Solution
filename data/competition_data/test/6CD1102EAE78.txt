Cell phones has become very popular over the past few years. Almost everybody who is old enough to drive have a cell phone. Cell phones are good to have and you have to know when to use it and how to use it. For instance using your phone while operating a vehicle is not ok.

Reason one drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because it causes accidents. When you're using your phone while whether you are on Facebook or texting you are now giving your cell phone attention instead of paying attention to how you are driving. General cell phone statistics states that "cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year". They also states that "1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving".

Reason two is it costs you money in the long run. Everybody knows it's against the law to use a cell phone while operating a motored vehicle. You can easily get a ticket and have to go to court. Or if you get to many tickets you can have you license suspended. It can also cost you your life or someone else life.

Therefore no, I don't think it's ok to use your cell phone while operating a vehicle. Even though cell phones are addictive there is an appropriate time to use them. That appropriate time is when you are home, not while operating a vehicle.
