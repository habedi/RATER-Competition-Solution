Dear School Principal,

It has come to my attention that you have been considering changing policy on participating in school sports from needing a C average to needing a B average. In order to think in the best interest of the students, I firmly believe that this policy change would be an incredible mistake. I think that the school should definitely not change their policy.

First, the majority of students at our school that are participating in sports and maintain a C average are doing the absolute best that they can do. Schools always want students to do their best when learning, and I don't see why any student should ever be punished for that. By forcing them to have a B average, its almost like punishing children that cannot sustain above average grades, and that would be unfair to students.

Next, by punishing students for having a C average, the school is sending a message to them that a C, which is an entirely acceptable grade, is not okay. This may unsettle several children within the school walls and cause more trouble than its really worth. I'm sure that we can all agree that students do not want violence in school any more than the faculty does, and that encouraging violence in any way would not be a good decision.

Also, students often times make mistakes in classes and accidentally end up with a C average. Many of these children are normally A and B average students that might have had a problem with a test or forgotten to do homework once or twice. These children are among the best that this school has to offer, and it would be a shame to see them paying for a mistake that they made once, especially since they have worked so hard in the past.

Finally, if the policy is changed, then the number of participants in sports will drop drastically. Depending on who might be affected by this change, our school may not have enough players for each sport, and it would be a shame for our school to lose the chance to participate in sports competitions with other schools. For some students, playing sports helps keep them grounded and out of trouble. Without the positive influence that sports provide, those children may begin to give in to negative aspects of their life, and recruit other students along the way.

In conclusion, I believe that changing the policy on sports to requiring students to have a B average instead of a C average would be a poor decision. Not only do sports help keep students grounded, but they also help students focus on their grades because of eligibility. By changing the policy, it may force students to give up on maintaining good grades, and that is not what the school would want in the end. In keeping the students' best interests at heart, I think that the school should definitely not change their policy on participation in sports.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
