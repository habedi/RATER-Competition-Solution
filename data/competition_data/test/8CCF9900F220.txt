why is having a cell phone better while you in school and using them when we have free time or have a free period ? Having a cell phone with you while you in school is good because what if there is an emergency in our family or something wrong happen to some one. Policy one is the best choice to have because if the teacher can trust while we have our phone we wont break that trust.

There is nothing bad we can do by having our phones with us, we cant kill or do nothing bad with them just talk and text that the only thing we usually do with phone. If we had policy 2 how would our family know were we are and what time we coming home. With out cell phones in school it would pretty much be unsafe to go or come back from school. If there was a drill where some one came into the school or had a gun while we where in school how would we be able to contact the outside world or what place we by where and what to do. The best part about having cell phone is we can text with out talking with out teachers getting mad because we talking or yelling that way they wont be mad all the time and have some quite time to her self or him self.

My final thought about all this is that student and teacher if teachers want we should be able to have cell phones. If policy 2 is the best choice how would teachers feel if they couldn't have cell phones not just because they are teaches means they could have one but if it was equal for every one. the same goes to every one what if they were all student of there job and they couldn't bring cell phones to there job it would be bad for them because they have things they need to do and people to contact. That's why policy one is our best choice to maybe even improve our education if they tell us if we finish eary we
