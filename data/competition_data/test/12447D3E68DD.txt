Throughout the years, humans have always had to get from point A to point B. To make this easier they use cars. But with air pollution and traffic being an issue in most countries, mayors are deciding to put down the car keys and pick up their walking shoes.

To begin with, air pollution is becoming a big issue on the Earth. Greenhouse gases are being released and most of them come from cars alone. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States" (Section 1, Paragraph 5). Cars and trucks are causing our Earth, our home, to waste away because of the gases they give out. If more people decided to walk to where they need to go instead of driving, then it would reduce the gases that cars and trucks give out. With more people walking rather than driving, it would make the air more clean and the Earth a better place to live.

Further more, another reason people should decide to put down their car keys is because of the traffic that cars cause. Why France was trying to get rid of smog, they banned people from using their cars. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog" (Section 2, Paragraph 14). If more people walked or used public transportation rather than their own cars, traffic jams would decrese and also crashes. When people drive their own cars they tend to lose focus and they might hit someone. With less people driving then there would be less deaths from car accidents. Putting down your keys and walking or using public transportation, would be beneficial to not only you but also everyone else too.

In conclusion, people rely on cars every day of their lives. To get you to where you need to go, but if we continue to use cars every day and destroy the Earth then there will be no where for us to go in the future. Polluting the air and causing car accidents and deaths is not what we need to be doing. Put the keys down, and walk!
