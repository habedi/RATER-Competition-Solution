In Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author describes a new way technology could identify human emotions. This new technology is called the Facial Action Coding System, it can tell what emotions people have by scanning their faces. In this article he states that this could be applied to classrooms. I do not think this is a good idea in the sense that they are spying on kids and adjusting to how they feel.

One of the main reasons I do not think this is a good idea is because it would not make any sense. You would spend a bunch of money on something that would not really help kids out that much. We have programs for kids like that who are slower at learning than others. When he says that kids are going to get bored and it will change the lesson, but he does not know that kids are going to get bored of school no matter what.

I think that it would be wrong to have this in classrooms because they would be in-effective. I think that it would be in-effective because they would not care about it in the first place, or they would wait for something they know and could use to their advantage. Some kids would wait for it to change if they do not know the answer or do not know the lesson, so they would be able to get it done.

One thing that this could be used for is it to help out countries to figure out what other nation leaders and enimies are thinking, or how they are feeling. It is a nice program but I think it will not work for in-school applications. I think it would get in the way of kids learning. The system is actually pretty cool but I do not think that it should be used in education.
