Dear principal

I have heard that you may be considering changing school polices that students may not participate in sports unless they have at least a grade B

average . But many off those students have at least a grade C average. I believe that students with at least a grade C average should be able too play in sports because a C average is not fail it is passing but it is passing on a lower level of passing but it still counts . I think that if the student is failing one or more classes then he or she should not participate in sports until he or she gets his or her grades up. I understand you may think that the students should have a grade B average because it is important too keep your grades up even if your playing a sport but i still highly recommend that you make it a grade C

average because it will allow more students too play the sport that they would like too play but the catch is that if they do not keep there average up they can not continue too play that sport that they choose they will just have to focus on grades so they can play that sport . I have stated my opinion on what i think you should do you may take the idea or leave it but if you took the time too read this i thank you for listening to me idea.
