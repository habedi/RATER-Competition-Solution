Dear principal,

Hi~~~ my school principal I write this litter to you because I want to talk about the school policy that you want to change, I think this idea is wrong, because this rule make many people angry. they are people who like to play the sport , but the grade average not in B, they like the sport very much, they spend many time on sport they like, sport help them to community to other people. some are the people like to play the sport and average are on the B, they play the sport with their friend all the time, but the rule is change, some of they friend can't play the sport now, they fill is not fare to them. I'm the people who play sport too. maybe I know the their filling about it , they might fill sad and helpless, so please don't change to this policy, thank your.
