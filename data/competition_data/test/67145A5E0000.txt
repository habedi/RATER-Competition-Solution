The goal of this program is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog. The plan is so effective that even the rain won't stop the people from participating. This plan is set to spread to other countries. Beijing, China is one of the most polluted cities due to smog. Paris is said to have more smog than any other European capitals.
