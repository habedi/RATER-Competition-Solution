Dear TEACHER_NAME,

All students should be required to work at least 10 hours of community service each semester. Many students don't do a lot to help out the community. This is a good way to get kids more out there and wanting to be helpful. Some students don't do anything other than sit at home.

Another reason why i think students should be required 10 hour of community is that they can meet new friends. For example at nursing homes the can go out and entertain the elderly. There are also places like animal shelters that need kids in there walking dog or helping clean cages.

My final reason is that our earth is polluted badly and we need all the help we can get to help pick up trash. By cleaning out lakes and river we can be saving wildlife. Another way to help our earth and doing community service.

Students can plant gardens and grow fruits and vegetables. Those food grown can be given to a local homeless shelter. And you could volunteer to serve food. And be proud of how you helped people in need.

Many kids need to be more active physically. So if more kids get out and do more they can also get healthier.

Helping people in need or are lonely at the hospital or nursing home could always use company. And if you help anyone out with mowing lawns or painting a house for an elderly person that can count as community services.
