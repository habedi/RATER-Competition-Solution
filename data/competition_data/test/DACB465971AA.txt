Why should we do community service? We should do community service because to help our Country with the litter and to make it clean. We should help old people cross the road.

Picking up litter is good for our environment and helping people carry there stuff. If people dropped there stuff I would help them pick it up and take to there car, and there homes. If you look at the desert you see a lot of bottles and plastic bags and you want to make it clean so other people can know that we are a clean city. I would think that and I would go pick up as much as I can.

If i saw people struggle with there things I would help them take it were ever they need to take it. If that was you wouldn't you want some help you. I would and that's why we should have community service. If my dad was here he would told me "Always help one another." I love to donate stuff to the people that have ruined life's. i would love to help the people that are at the Hospital.

If my friends said that community service is the waste of time i would of told them just imagine you were one of these people and no one wanted to help you wouldn't you be mad.

They probably just want to play some video games and want to get fat. I would let them Know w
