Dear Principal

I really thank that students should have there cell phones at school cause what if they went somewhere in the school that no one can hear him or see him and he got trap he can get his cell phone and call someone or send a text. I leave mines at home cause it might get stole on the other hand. I really want to have phones out at school but you need to have them out class cause it take you from your work. During your lunch or break you can have them out and text but can't talk on them.

We can have the teachers to take them up before they walk in the class that how you do not have to worry about who phone was ringing or who texting. We should make a rule for cell phone to be brought to school and make sure they are on silence so when the teacher hear them they can take them then but if its on silence and you are at lunch or break and they hear them they can't take them from you. Our principal need to let us bring phones to school so if we got an emergency on the bus or when we get home and no one is there we got our cell phone to call someone.

Teachers should ask peoples to put there phones in a box with there names on it so when class is over with she would pass them back out. I had my phone took up before cause the teacher caught me with it. But if we had the cell phone rule i will have my phone right now but i got a new phone now and i'm not going to bring it to school until they say we can have phones out at school then everybody will bring there phones to school. My principal might let us have them cause his is a nice man and he know that some people walks around know with there cell phone if he see them he will tell you to put it up or if that's you second time he have told you he will be like bring it here or hand it to me and come with me to my office.

i just wish that they let us have them out at school so i can start bringing mine to school. So if you are reading this principal please let us have our cell phones out at school and just make a couple of rule so we won't just be doing anything when we have them out.
