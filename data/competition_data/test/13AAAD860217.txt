As we get older there are more things we want to acomplish. Taking home classes doesn't always benefit students because the social enviroment is not being developed in a possitive way. Although, some students will feel more comfortable if they recieve distance classes and have video conferences online because whether they are not prepared to atttend to a regular school or they just don't like other students. It is true that being expossed to interact with other students can sometimes be tough, but having the opportunity to learn from a regular school can also be benefitial and some ways attending to school can helps us learn better than taking home classes are having a profesional teacher, meeting new people, and able to show leadership.

First of all, we can find a lot of stuff online now a days, but there is when the issue starts. Not having someone to explain and provide specific information can be difficult in our path of learning. An example from my experience could be when I was still living in Mexico and I had to recieve English classes at home, but the online resources weren't the best ones to learn from. However, when I moved to the U.S., I started going to a regular school and it was easier for me to get along with the English language because the teachers helped me having a better understanding of what it was about and how to overcome in a short period of time.

Another way that attending to a shool can be benefitial is, getting to know new people. As it has been said, becoming a teeneger leads us to want to afford new things. Meeting other students is so helpful because our social enviroment is increasing and the chances to succeed are maximied. In my case, interacting with other students helped me create a better social background and grow in a high standar community as well as having friend because friendships are essential in a teeneger life.

Additionally, being able to show leadership can help our selves as well as others. At a certain moment, most of the teenegers have to go to college and it is difficult to get accepted in because many of the colleges in the U.S. want students that are capleble to maintain in a possition to represent them in their community. For example, from my school there are a lot of after school activities as well as clubs where we can share important information of what is going on in school and out of school. They also prepared us to know how to talk in front of others and without a doubt clarify why we are standing there. This is what most of the universities want to see from a reguar high school student that attends to a regular school.

As shown above, creating new opportinities to grow in our learning skills can be found in a school. Which it is a more possible way to acomplish our goals, rather than being at home without a light of success. In fact, having the opportunity to stablish a stable learning growth it's not something that can be dissmissed because attending to a school can be helpful in ways such as having a profesional teacher, meeting new people, and able to show leadership. Once we take the step of taking classes in a school, rather than taking online classes at home, our lives will be easier.
