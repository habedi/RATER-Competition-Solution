On the driveless car I think that they should full test them out before they make more. Like to see what's safe or what's not & they should have rules for the cars like don't go to sleep while in driveless mode cause that mode may turn off it self. Someone should have likea training car place for driveless cars so when they actually get on the road they'll know what to do. Like if they had got tired or something the person teaching them would tell them or show the what will happen. Driveless cars should be more worked on because we don't know if they fully are safe. Enginers should have a full experince if the driveless car stops working or something is wrong with it so they know that the driver & the driveless car are safe and fully sucure. Google makes cars that drives on it's own but needs help parking it so it ain't all the way driveles. The brakes on the driveless car should be checked every month cause if It's not it can have crashed into something and camera's should be checked and other things that are important to car should be checked and made sure it's working the way it should be .
