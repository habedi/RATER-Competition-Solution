In today's society I think phones should be prohibited while operating a vehicle. Every year there are about 6 million car accidents dealing with teenagers between the ages 16 to 19 years old. We as people don't understand that when using a phone while driving they are taking their eyes off the road, people are more worried about their conversation which makes their concentration severely impacted, and it causes more accidents. In order to fix this problem, we as a unit need to break the habit of using phones while driving.

Due to people being on their phones its putting other people's lives at danger. When you're driving in your cellular device start going off that become a distraction. People are more urge to text back. In spite of the fact that picking up or taking a glance can increase you getting into an accident. Entitled to this problem people should put phones on Do Not Disturb or driving mode.

Their reaction time is slower. Resulting in the fact that they are on their phones. For an example, when you are on the highway in a song comes on that you don't like you take your eyes off the road to change it. This means the reaction time is affected by not being focused. Instead of changing it while driving wait until you come to a complete stop then change it.

So many car accidents happened in this day of age that people are being taken away from families. Many people lose loved ones or close friends, because of careless drivers. Most teens don't think about the causes that can affect others. Not to mention adults and teens don't think about their actions when putting other people live at matter. As a result, in making bad actions we as a whole need to think before driving recklessly.

Here are the given reasons to why phones should be prohibited while operating a vehicle. There are too many people losing their lives, reaction time is not as fast, and most of the accidents caused by ages between 16 to 19 years old. Parents should teach their children the do's and don'ts while driving, because there are a higher risks of their concentration being severely impact.
