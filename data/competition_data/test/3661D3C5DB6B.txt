I disagree with what the princicapel says since students here shouldn't be made do an curricular acitivity, it's uncostitutional.

Making Students do an extracurricular activivty will not work out since not all of the students at our middle school want to pick an activity to participate in.

This would looked at to be forced, since for the thew that don't pick an activity the school would have to choose a random activity for them to enjoy. I think if the school makes all the student do atleast one extracurricular activity it'll be like the school is forcing them to do it. Us students shouldn't be forced to do anything that's not part of the edjucation our school gives in the first place.

These activitys might be to much to handle for a student physically or mentally. Physically a student may not be able to compete in an activity such a an phisical sport due to a phisical or a mental condition. This is probably why the student didn't play the sport before the princaple made their decision.

Mentally this can also be rough on a student to particpate in an particular activity since it'd be more work for them handle arleady added on to the school work they already have. For example working on the year book all year and completing it before the deadline.

If a student doesn't play a sport or do anything woudn't they become lazy or even somewhat unhealthy. If you are asking this question you forgotten about the GYM class that all students are required to take at our middle school. Our GYM class activitys should provide every student to stay healthy and in shape here at our school. If a student wants to participate in an activity like playing a sport or joining a club it should be their choice and their parents choice to decide if they want to join in on an the activity or not. It shouldn't be the schools choice!

Students might improve socially and could have some fun their activity. Yes that is true but what if some or even most of the students don't enjoy their activity they're in. The proof for this is that this would happen a lot since the principle made the decicsion to have every student in a extra curricular activity whether they like it or not . I think that us students would be better off we can choose what we want to do, so we enjoy what we want to do.

I think that students shouldn't have to particapate in a extracurricular activity in they don't want to. This way everyone gets to do what they want to do. According to what the first admendment in our consititution says.
