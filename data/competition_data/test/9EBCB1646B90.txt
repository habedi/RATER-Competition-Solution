As adolescents become more reliant on technology, so does their strong need to multitask as well. Many believe multitasking benefits one to become more efficient and accomplish more tasks. Although this sounds good in theory, the outcome can produce multiple errors. The constant shift of attention causes drivers to keep their eyes off the road, which leads to constant pullovers. In addition, the driver can exceed the speed limit and not be able to see stop signs or traffic lights. This will lead the driver into an unwanted accident and cause confusion and delay among drivers.
