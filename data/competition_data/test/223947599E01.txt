Dear Principal,

I am here today asking you to have cell phone to be allowed in school to be used at any free time such as lunch, SSR(but students still have to read), free blocks, study hall, and in the hallways at school. For example, what if I want to talk to another person at another school and were both in free time I'm going to want to text him or her to see what is going on and if they want to hang out after school or something like that. If i wait for school to be over I'll probably forget or it will be to late they have other plans. I want to be able to not getting in trouble for things that i should be able to do. If you are worried about people sending people nasty text messages it's still going to happen weather in school or not. The time to change this bad rule is now so go with policy one because even though you must think that your students aren't texting in class the are most likely are you just haven't caught them. i believe that if we did a ratio that 75% out of a hundred kids are texting each other in class but you just don't know it. Students know that teachers look for a little light to see if there texting but the kids aren't that dumb. If the teachers didn't know this already you can dim the light on your phone so that the teachers don't know if your texting because they don't see that little light. All I'm saying is that you will never stop your students from texting in class so why don't you give them all the time they can get from walking to other classes in the hall, free blocks, SSR, and study hall and you will not have to worry about them texting in class because they can just wait every hour or so to texting the hall. I promise you that if you go with policy one there will never be a texting problem in your class again.
