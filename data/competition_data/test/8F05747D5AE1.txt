Dear Principal,

I think students should have to do community service .In my opinion community service helps kids become better citizens.

First, lets say someone is cleaning up litter as community service. By cleaning a park or the playground at a school the community would seem like a clean place to live. More people would be interested in moving here. They would think, 'Look at how clean it is!' or, 'What a great place to live'. Cleaning up trash as community service wouldn't only benefit our community, it would benefit our planet. We would help reduce pollution in the air and global warming.

Someone who disagrees with me might say that kids should have an opinion on whether or not to do community service. But think of this: how many kids actually want to do community service. Would you have done community service as a kid, i think not.

Lastly, community service would give kids something to do in the afternoon. More kids would stay out of trouble. Less kids would spend their afternoon playing video games. I honestly think that community service would have a positive effect on students.

Sincerely,
