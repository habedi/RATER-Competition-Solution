I think that the policy is unfair because many students want to participate in the sports .It is really not good to do that because we have to be fair in ever thing .So what i think that students could participate in the sports by a C average it would be fair for that not and for people that have F and D they could not because they are not trying. The students that have C they try to get a C or B or A

and it will be fair with that because many people try and other don't try at all. So it would be a fair . I really don't wont this policy for that reason . Were very good and we try our best to get a C and there are a lot of people that don't even try to .So we really want to be in sports and it would be a very strong reason which is that we don't want this policy at all . there are more students with C

and not a lot of people with a B or A

but no we try our best to do good bout you have to not put that policy . Will we don't accept this change because no one would participate if they don't change it back so that is what i think about thus policy. We don't need this we wont something we just want to keep it the way we had it . I think that is not the way to see it when you are about to make something new . People wont like it because it is un fair . That is what i really think about this unfair rule . Th at people would not accept this rule no matter what. There are many ways you could
