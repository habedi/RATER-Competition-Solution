The rate of of people dying in automobiles has increased 300% because of people using their phones while driving. Using a phone while driving should NOT even be debatable. The consequences that could come with that are way too dangerous. It could cause distractions, an accident or even worse, death. Being in any of those situations could be very harmful not just to you but the others in the car with you. The government should get involved by making laws.

Using phones while driving should be illegal everywhere.

To begin with, using your phone while driving could cause a distraction. For example, if you're driving and there's an ambulance or a police officer trying to get through because of an emergency, the driver may not hear or see the sirens because they are distracted on their phone. Someone could be critical conditions in the ambulance but can't get the hospital because of the person that's distracted on their phone. Sometimes you have to use your phone for an emergency. Just wait till you get to your destination. Cell phone distractions can also cause problems to a pedestrian or even a driver that is swerving. Being distracted by a cell phone is similar to being drunk and driving.

Another consequence that it could have is an accident could occur. It could be the slightest accident but its still considered an accident. Which means someone has to call the cops to report the accident and the cop will take at least 45-60 minutes just to arrive which is a waste of time and money because if it was your fault your insurance cost rise up 60+ more a month. Depending on what the driver already pays it could be way more. That's just for a slight accident. All of that for using your mobile device.

Last but not least, the use of your phone while driving can cause death. The driver could be so distracted that they are unaware of how fast they are driving. If you get into a head on accident at a high speed it can cause death or even crashing into a tree at high speed it can do the same. If you have others in the car with you, you're putting others lives at danger. That could affect the people that love you and love them as well. All of that because you forgot to shoot someone a text back.

Yes, we get it, sometimes using your phone while you're driving is needed for an emergency. Don't just use it to text your friends back or to put music on. Do all that before you take off. Because remember all the bad things that could happen just for using your phone while driving. Keep your eyes on the road.
