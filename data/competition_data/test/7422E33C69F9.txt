"Facial expressions for each emotion are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expresions", as observed by Dr. Huang. A new software called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The process starts when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the person's face. Each characteristic movement of our facial muscles is associated with six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The use of this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it will help teachers know when their students are confused, awares the teacher if the students are going through something, and help the teachers make learning more enjoyable due to them knowing when the students are bored.

This new software can be useful in a classroom environment because it will help the teachers know when their students are having difficulites or are confused. There are times when students are too afraid to speak up about not knowing the material because others might find it more simple than them. The Facial Action Coding System will allow teachers to know when their students are confused about a topic, and it will help them give that student the assistance they need. Some students can have difficulties when it comes to learning new material and take longer than others to grasp it. This new software will be of great use in the classroom because teachers will be able to offer help to the students that need it or direct students who do understand the material to those who don't. The system could also be used to notify the teacher when their students do understand the material, so they don't continue to go over it and be able to move on. Overall, this system will benefit both the students and the teachers.

Another reason to why this new system will be valuable in a classroom is that it will allow the teachers to be aware of other emotions the students are having besides confusion. Some students could be dealing with issues at home, and when they come to school they aren't in the best mood. When students of any age are dealing with an event or issue, it can affect them when learning.

The Facial Action Coding System could be used to detect a students emotional expressions, and in doing that it will allow the teacher to give his/her students the attention they need. When students have the right mind set, they are more prepared to learn and give it their all. When students are filled with sadness or even anger, they will not make the best decisions both in and out of class. Making sure the students are an environment where they feel safe and comfortable is important, and this new software can be of great help with that.

The Facial Action Coding System could also be helpful of letting the teacher know when his/her students are bored, so they could find a way to make it more enjoyable. There are students who have more trouble learning when the material is presented to them in a lecture format. Many students learn easier with more hands on activities or discussions. When students become bored in class, they can tend to get distracted or stop paying attention. The Facial Action Coding System can be used to recognize when a student is becoming bored or unamused with the lesson. This will notify the teachers that they may want to try new ways of presenting the material, so that their students don't get bored and stop paying attention. The system could also let the teachers know when their students are actually entertained with the material or how they are teaching, so they can continue to do it the way they are. When it comes to younger children or teenagers, it becomes harder for teachers to keep them involved and listening, so it is important to keep a classroom and teaching simple and enjoyable for the students. The more they want to learn about the material, the more they will understand it.

Although this new system is of great use, it is possible that it is not the most reliable. As humans we are a more complex system to understand at times. Emotions are difficult to control at times and even understand. As individuals, especially at a younger age, we can have trouble understanding our own feelings and how to deal with them. At the end of the day it is a machine that is telling you how you feel, and it cannot always be accurate. It can be helpful in many situations, but we should still be carefu with how credible the data is.

The use of this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it will help teachers know when their students are confused, awares the teacher if the students are going through something, and help them make learning more enjoyable when the students are becoming bored. This new software can be of many uses in a classroom environment, and it can better prepare students for the world around them. Technology has changed and advanced over time to the point of being able to recognize emotional expressions on people. With new advancements being made in technology all the time, it will lead to more changed and hopefully help solve problems and better the world around us.
