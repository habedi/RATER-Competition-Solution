As a student i believe phones are helpful. A reason why i think this is because when there is an event at school we would like to stay for we can call our parents to tell them, without having to go to the office. Another reason why I think cell phones are helpful, is that if there is an emergency you can call almost anyone you need to. Though cell phones can be a distraction they are more useful then anything else. I think all students from sixth grade up should have a cell phone. They are very handy \and have a lot of tools on them. An example of tools that cell phones have are: calculator, alarm clock, stop watch, e-z tip calculator and many more helpful tools. If a student brings out a cell phone in class a teacher should have the authority to take it away. Policy two is better in my opinion because a student should have the right to bring it to school. But if it is interfering with this students learning a teacher or principle can confiscate it.

The defects of letting a student bring a phone to school is that if he/she was to use the cell phone in class it will disrupt the learning of this student and others. Another reason why it is a bad idea is that a student can video tape or take a picture of an embarrassing event that happened about another student. One student can record voice of another to hold against them. Phones these days are so high tech that you can access internet on your phone without using the schools wifi. If a student has a phone like that he/she can browse the internet during class as well for answers if he/she needed it. Over all in my opinion cell phones are more of a help then a bad idea.
