Dear Principal,

I do not think students should be required to do community service because, some students might not be physically fit enough to do it. Also, others may have a very busy life that they may not have the time to do it. And others may not think it's fair if other schools don't have to do it and they do.

A person that's not physically fit enough may hurt themselves. If they are picking up rubbish, they could strain themselves if they have to bend down too far. If it's during the day, they could work too hard and get a heat stroke. With this happening, it could cause death or lifetime pain.

For people that don't have time it might make life a whole lot harder. These people could have other activities that were scheduled before being told that they must do community service. If so, they must go through either rushing to get to the place they need to be or not even be able to make it there. Then sooner or later, they might turn out to be very gloomy adults because they weren't able to enjoy life as a child.

Because it's the principals choice, some schools may have to and some schools may not. The students may get mad and move to another school. It then may lead to a school closing because it doesn't have enough students. If that happens, the principals should let the students decide if they want to do community service or not.

These are my reasons why I don't believe students must do community service.

Sincerely,

Student
