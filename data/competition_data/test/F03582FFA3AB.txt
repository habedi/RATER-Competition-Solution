Dear Principal,

I think you should not make the students do community service. For these three reasons: make it a contest, question the students, and figure out some ways the students can do community service. If they truly care about their community and was not selfish they would consider or all ready doing community service. This should be a option for the students. please consider these things in this letter.

One thing you should consider before making community service a requirement. Ask the students why they aren't doing community service and see if they have a good reason. Like, See if they want too. Maybe, if you encourage them more they would consider it. Even ask the parents. Give both the students and parents some suggestions to help.

The other things is you should make it a contest. Like, make the contest like whoever has the most community service hours; Those students that decide to do the challenge would get rewarded. The students would feel better about themselves for helping out and might even do more community services.

I'm sure that would get more students up and doing more things for the community.

The last thing you should consider is take it in consideration that some of the students may not like getting up and being active. They may like to stay inside playing video games or they could be allergic to something outside. Find some things you can do for the community while being inside. Like, you could babysit some little ones while the parents have a get together or if the community is throwing a barbecue. That would be one example of doing community service but still be able to be inside.

I hope you take these things in consideration. There may be a lot of students wishings they could help out but just hasn't found out how they could help. Give the students some examples of how they could help. Like i said before please think hard and clear about this decision then making it official. i would really think this would be a good idea and make a improvement on children in the community.
