From ballet to yearbook, there are many extracurricular activities you can take part in, but there are more benefits that come with extracurricular activities than meets the eye. Some people don't do extracurricular activities because of fear and uncertainty. Avoiding extracurricular activities can have a negative impact on your life. There are many benefits, long term and short term, to doing extracurricular activities. If extracurricular activities are made mandatory, it can help students overcome fears and find things they're passionate about. Making extracurricular activities compulsory for students will help them by creating new friendships, helping them get into collage and giving students new experiences.

Making extracurricular activities compulsory will help students make friends and build relationships. Engaging in extracurricular activities will help students find people they have something in common with. For example, last year I was in the green eagles club and I met a lot of people I might not have hung out with otherwise. Going to clubs and after school activities will help student meet people they would not usually be friends with and help broaden your perspectives.

Many students are shy and have a hard time making friends, but if extracurricular activities are made mandatory it will help pull them out if their shells and develop social skills which are incredibly important throughout life. Having all student go to extracurricular activities will also introduce kids to many different types of people so that they have a better view of the world.

Engaging in extracurricular activities can help you get into a good collage. While collages will look at your grades, they will also look at your extracurricular activities. Collages want not only smart people but also well rounded people who have many interests and will bring something to their school. When I asked my cousin, who goes to Generic_School, about when he applied for collage he said that collages will look at tons of people with good grades but what makes you stand out is your extracurricular activities and the extra things you do. Therefore, if it's mandatory for kids to do extracurricular activities, they will have a higher chance of getting into a good collage and this will help them in the long run.

Taking part in extracurricular activities will give students new experiences. Whether it's being in an uncomfortable situation or just hanging out with your friends, your experiences are important because they are part of what shapes who you are as a person. If students take part in extracurricular activities, they might even find something they truly enjoy doing. Being in an extracurricular activity will expose students to other ideas and cultures which will in turn broaden their perspectives and make them more empathetic. When I was in sixth grade and I told one of my friends I was vegetarian, she said sorry, looking at me with pity. After a while she learned that I chose to be vegetarian, and that I enjoy it. This changed her perspective on what vegetarians are like and has made her more aware. When you expose kids to ideas, especially controversial ones, it helps them start to formulate their own opinions bases of of what they think and not what others tell them to think. It is very important that all people are exposed to others who are different to themselves and if all students take extracurricular activities, they will benefit through learning about their peers.

Building relationships with people is an important skill that will be used throughout life and extracurricular activities will force students to be in positions where they will make friends. In the long run, extracurricular activities will help you in many ways such as getting you into a good collage which will eventually help you lead a good life. Taking extra curricular activities will make you a more well rounded and aware person and might even help you discover a passion. On top of this, by taking an extracurricular activity, students will gain new experiences which will broaden their perspectives. It is vital that students are exposed to other cultures and types of people because this will over all help to shape their out look on the world and make them more empathetic human beings. If extracurricular activities become mandatory, students will benefit because, they will make friends, it will help them get into collage, and give students new experiences.
