ello fellow citezens , we are here to inform you about limit car usage. First driving to much can cause harm to the population . Second Germaney continue their lives with out cars . Last but not least driving to much can cause smog .

First let me say every minute of this day a type of car or truck is causuing damage to the wolrd with its gas . For example every morning I drive to school I see gas coming out from the exghust pipe from multiple cars . Every time a car turns on there a chance the world breaks down . Plants and tree dies slowly .

Next let me tell you about Germany how they live everyday with out usuing cars . For example , Seventy percent of the Vauban's family does not own a car . 57 percent sell their cars to move to a new area . How do they live or get to their destinantion ? Well let me tell you they either walk or ride bikes there . There are even commercial about tranpostation . They say it low emmisions and imprives safety .

Last but not least cars can cause smog . For example , In Bogota , Colombia people either hike , bike , skate , or even took buses to work . Colombia had bannded cars for the tird year . With only buses and taxis that were permitted only . The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog .

Violaters would face a twenty-five dollars fine.

To wrap it up limit car usage can cause harm and effect the world . First driving to much can cause harm to the population . Second Germaney continue their lives with out cars . Last but not least driving to much can cause smog .        Â
