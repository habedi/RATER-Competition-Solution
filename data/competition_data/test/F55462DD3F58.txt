The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers it presents because ''...may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system''.

If that's the case, we should most definitely try to explore Venus. It would be hard but possible because NASA has ''compelling ideas for sending humans to study Venus''. Their idea was to ''allow scientists to float above the fray''. Meaning they would be about 30 miles or so in the air avoiding Venus's harsh ground conditions. Since their about 30 miles above the surface, the temperatures would be a cozy 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the air pressure would close to that of sea levels on Earth and radiation would not exceed Earth's levels. This isn't easy conditions for humans but it's survivable.

However, hovering over Venus from a ship above the planet is safe but it can't get us certain information that we'll need like samples of gas, rocks, or anything else. But the good news is, NASA is working on other alternatives to study Venus. An example of this would be, ''...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks...'', Another example would be, mechanical computers. Mechanical computers are devices that make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics what so ever. Though modern computers are powerful, they tend to be weak when it comes to extreme physical conditions. ''By comparison,systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces''.

In conclusion, We will eventually get to Venus and when we do, we will not only gain insight on the planet, but we will also get to see what human curiosity can lead us to. Our travels in space should not be limited by doubts and dangers because without doubt and danger how will we expand our horizons and learn?
