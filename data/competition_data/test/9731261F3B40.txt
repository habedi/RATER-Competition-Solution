Cars are a major deal now of days because we are dependent on getting somewhere with a car. Little do you know that it damages and hurts our environment. Limiting or even getting rid of cars would be the smartest thing we will ever do. It would not only help us now but it will help the generations after us.

Have you ever wondered what would happen if we limit vehicle usage and only used tranzits and taxis? What would happen would be miraculous. The greenhouse effect would stop, smog would be no more, and pollution would be cut to a minimum. It can be done we just have to set our mind to do it like a the few cities and countries have been doing.

If the world only used tranzits or taxis to get to places the differences would be endless. Traffic would go down and the transportation your taking wouldn't even take long to get to your destination. It would also save you money instead of $20 every day for gas you would spend $2-$3 a day. Life would be easier and safer if cars were limited.
