Venus is the closest planet to the Earth and despite its challenges scientists need to explore Venus to study the worst condition in the planet to see if its a managable place to go for a planetary visit so that in case of danger in the Earth there is a closer place to run to and be safe in.

The author explains how Venus is a challenging planet by telling us how it has been the only planet without a single spaceship landing on it in three decades because no one survived the landing more than a few hours. Venus also has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid with temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is 90 times hotter than the earth. beyond that it suffers a lot of natural disasters.

Even with all of this

Astronomers sre facinated by Venus because it might as well once been the most earth like planet in our solar system.

NASA's possible solutions for making venus survivable for humans was to float above the fray to avoid the harsh conditions on the ground. Through this the air pressure would be close to the sea level on the earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiatio would not exceed earth levels.

To acheive this scientists have to refrain from bringing things like rocks or gas or anything from a distance, so to change that, NASA is working on how to make electronics with silicon carbide and also using old technologies that dosent require electronics to prevent them melting and causing radiation.

In conclusion our travels on earth should'nt be limited by the dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet edges of immagination and innovation.
