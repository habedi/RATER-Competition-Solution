Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't agree with the grade B average, many students have C's and B's. It's not easy keeping it above at least a 80. Things change in class easily and new things start so it drops our grade. Most of the students like to play sports and a lot of us can't if you change it to B average. We would also more then likely loose some of our best players. And we need them to help us win our games. None of the students agree with this rule, some of our best players have a C average and you would be kicking them off the team by doing this.

Many of the students and I are trying to get you to change your mind about making us keep above a B average, it isn't fare to our good players even our ok players we need our players. And if all the players have at least one C there wont be a team since you kicked them all off of the team. Then what will we do? We wont have a team to represent our school, and we need that we can't not have a team. As I know many of the basketball players have a C average and also our best player does too. And we need them and him.

We are asking you please not to change the grade limit. We want to keep our good players. And if you must make the change, will you give the team time to make that grade higher? Because it wouldn't be fair if you just made it the rule and not give them time to make it higher. I think that how the rules are now are perfect no failing grades you can be on the team. If their not failing then it shouldn't be a probably with them being on the teams.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
