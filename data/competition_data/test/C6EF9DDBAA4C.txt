Put yourself in a position were you are a student at school and you principle recently announced that every student is going to have to take an extracurricular activity like sports, working on the yearbook, serve at the student council, etc. How would you respond to this and what would you do to defend or argue against it. I argue against it and say that all students should not take an extracurricular activity because they maybe have interest into it, be clueless of what do to in the activity, or maybe have more important things to do instead of that activity. In my paper hopefully I convince you to argue against why students must participate in extracurricular activities.

First thing I say a student in some case may have no interest into the activity because he has experienced it before and didn't like it or had a bad experience. For example if the school has only three sport activities like baseball, soccer, and football the student just wants to do a sport. The student doesn't want to do football at all because he couldn't throw as far as all the other kids and got bullied for it having a really bad time. And since there is a little amount of sport activities he will be a lucky guy if he got baseball or soccer. The next day he finds out everything has been filled for soccer and baseball and he doesn't want to do anything else either than a sport so he just has to choose football. What would you do if someone bulllied you for not doing something properly and be afraid to do it again.

Second thing is maybe the student has no clue in what to do the activity he chose but has to try to do it because his parents think he should try something new in something he or she doesn't like but just wants them to feel happy. If the student joins a science club but enjoys doing coding on computers he or she has to try to do it because he wants to make his or her parents happy. Also the student parents do a check up on him everyday to see what he or she has learned in the science club but doesn't know that much in science so the student can't say much about it. Eventually the student gets tired of it and tells his or her parents he or she doesn't like it but its to late for the student now, every other club is full and can't take anymore now he just has to deal with it. If you were in this situation were you didn't like something and you wated to change it what would you do?

Third thing is if a student has more important things to do like study for a test, finish a big project, or finish late homework but at the same time he wants to practice soccer because he wants to become a soccer player when he or she grows up what can he do to balance things out between school and sports. If there were more activities throughout the school that had both in this case like one week about working on school and another on just sports that would be his or her top choice. So he is going to have to make a difficult choice and both of them can lead him or her to bad things if he doesn't do one or the other. How would you handle this situation of balancing important things out.

In conclusion I argue against it and say that all students should not take an extracurricular activity because they maybe have interest into it, be clueless of what do to in the activity, or maybe have more important things to do instead of that activity. All I'm saying if you want to make students take extracurricular activity mandatory have more clubs than you can think of so each student can be satisfied or rearrange students after the process of them selecting clubs. Think about hard desicions will be and how will you solve problems that appear out of nowhere.
