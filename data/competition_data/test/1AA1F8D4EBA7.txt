The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. The "Face on Mars" isn't anything but a landform. We have scientific proof that it's just a landform. This essay is going to show 20th cetury tecnology wasn't what we have now, landforms around the area they were looking at are actually quite common and, you don't always need to buy into what others are selling. In this essay I'll give you the answers you need to believe the truth.

In 1976 cameras didn't have good quality picture unlike now. Our technologies are changing and they're changing fast. The 1976 version of the Face was blurry and you could barely see what the picture was. Even the 1998 version was pretty bad, but you could make it out a little more than in 76. The 2001 clearly states that it was in no way a face or an ancient civilization on Mars.

The scientists themselves even felt that what they were seeing was a Mesa. And the second paragraph of the story explains," Scienctists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." Plus in paragraph 12 Garvin says," It remind me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plainof Idaho. That's a Lava dome that takes te form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." Scientists information is usually pretty credible, you can usually trust that what they are telling is the truth.

Don't believe every news healine and story you see. Everyone has seen the magazines you find that pulls people in with hazardous rumors and lies, things that just aren't true. The '' Face on Mars '' happens to be a pretty big deal. Its been in movies, radio shows, magazines and a whole lot more. But is all of that really something that you can take full trust in. Not every writer, newspaper and magazine is right. They don't always get good information thats why you stick to someone you know who will tell you the truth like a scienctist.

So in conclusion, " The Face on Mars'' isn't really a face at all nor a ancient alien artifact. It's simply a natual landform most likely a mesa or butte. Trust me its not a face its just weird shadows that make it seem to look like a face. If there was really something to see by now we would have seen it and the facts are not in favour of silly conspiracy theorists. Now you know " The Face on Mars'' is more like a mesa on mars.
