As the school year comes to a close, countless students look forward to spending their days relaxing by the pool, going on vacation, and hanging out with their friends. For some, however, the beginning of summer break also means preparing for the next school year. Summer assignments are common among advanced high school classes, and are equally dreaded by most high school students. Moreover, teacher-designed projects do not spark much interest from those who must complete them. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should allow students to design their assignments because it promotes responsibility, keeps students interested, and provides more opportunities for students in school and in the future.

When completing an assignment over the summer break, students are responsible for setting time aside in order to work and study. A good sense of responsibility is an essential part of designing a project and making sure it gets done. When crafting a project, students are responsible for creating their own ideas and implementing them correctly, in order to create an interactive and challenging assignment. Without good time management skills, a student may fall behind, leaving them with a sub par project, and most likely a disappointed teacher. Allowing a student to take the lead on designing a project will promote the necessary components of learning good time management. As well as time management, a student also learns how to balance priorities. Yes, summer is an amazing opportunity to have fun, but it also provides the means to be better prepared for the school year. When a student decides to prioritize a summer project over a video game or TV program, they set themselves up for future success in the form of a high grade. Focusing on one's priorities teaches them a great deal of responsibility, and can be applied to many different situations in the future. Allowing a student to design their own project teaches them how to effectively manage their time and understand their priorities, leading them to become more responsible.

When a student learns or studies about something they are interested in, they are able to absorb more information. Letting a student design their own project will assist in a more powerful learning experience. If a student who was interested in trains received a project about frogs, chances are he/she would quickly become disinterested and bored. A student would perform far better on an assignment that their interests can be applied to. A student designed project promotes creativity, as well as sponsoring individuality. Moreover, it is almost impossible for a teacher to design a project that caters towards all the needs and interests of his/her students. A student-lead project would return higher grades and provide a way for a teacher to further understand each of her students, the way they learn, and their personal interests. This allows for a stronger relationship between a teacher and /his/her class, and creates a more beneficial learning environment. The decision to allow students to design their own projects will make for a more impactful, enjoyable, and interesting learning experience.

Lastly, a student-designed project will provide more opportunity for students to expand their network, and discover what they want to study and achieve in the future. When working on a project or assignment that is based off the personal interests of an individual student, they could be inspired to study further into their chosen subject, and provide them with an idea of what they want in the future. A student who studies trains could soon realize that he/she is more interested in planes, and now wants to be a pilot. They could also be influenced to join a school club or get a job that pertains to their chosen subject. The ideas that they create when designing their own project can be applied to their goals for the future. As well as providing ideas for their career and future studies, they will also be able to expand their network of people who have the same aspirations as them. Designing a project allows for one to work with many different people, such as a partner or group, and offers the means to build new relationships and acquaintances. The idea of a student-designed summer project is more effective in expanding a student's knowledge of personal goals, and provides an environment with many opportunities to meet new people and discover new ideas.

In conclusion, the benefits of a student-designed project are far greater than those of a teacher-designed project. Students learn new skills, such as responsibility and time management. They are also provided with opportunity to expand their knowledge, discover their interests, and discover themselves as an individual. The people they meet and work with throughout designing and completing a summer project will benefit them in school, further studies, and possibly even the work force. The idea of a student-designed project proves itself to be a more beneficial, rewarding, and fun experience.
