Most people might want to get rid of the Electoral College and change to popoular vote, because of how unfair, voters have no say so in who gets pick president.

One reason you might want to change to popular vote is because of how unfair they can be all because of the winner-takes-all system and this this system is in easch state, and because of that candidates dont spend time in states they know that wont vote for them. Just like you can't pick who you want your president to be.

Voters can't pick who they want their president to be its all the Electoral college. Voters don't even get to vote for the president thay vote for a slate of electors. just like if you live in Texas and you voted for Kerry you didnt vote for him you voted for 34 demcartic electors.

The only argument against the Electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. Americans should feel lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest problem electionÂ  in a century.

Given that most voters vote one party for president and another for congress they do this becaus ethis think a tie or deadlock will happen but, consider this. In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 voters would of dead locked the election yet in 1976 a tie would of happen but 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii voted the other way.

This right here is the most basic level the electoral college is unfair and should let the voters have their voice when voting.
