Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think your plan to change the school's policy is just fine. I love the idea of you making the student body work hard for something they want. Not everything should be handed to them. If they wish to represent our school they should keep their grades high enough. We wouldn't want someone who can't keep their grades decent to represent our great school. Even though most students in the athletic department have a grade C averages, we should make our students work hard enough to make it to where they want to be in life.

If the students don't work hard enough, how will they know to work for something they want? If we hand them everything they won't learn a life lesson they need. They can't keep thinking that everything will be handed to them when they please. If they have a grade C average, they will know that its not good enough to represent this school. That will tell them that they need to work harder. Not only will them making higher grades will benefit them but our school, too. This action you could take will put our school in a higher category than most other schools in Texas. This will make our school as a whole, a better place. This could keep our grades a place where other schools wish they had them.

In conclusion, I hope you come through with this decision. This will benefit us in many ways. This could make our student body care more about what they're doing. It makes them want something even more. It will also teach them a good lesson, always work hard to get something in return. If they work hard in school, they will be rewarded with an out of school activity.
