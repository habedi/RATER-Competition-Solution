Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Good morning TEACHER_NAME. How are you ? Me ? Oh, I've been pretty good just trying to stay on top of school work to full fill my dreams.

So I heard about how you wanted to make sure everyone had a B average in order to play sports, well I have to say it is a very good idea, but I disagree that it's fair.

Some students may be really athletic and may not have a lot of intelligence. So I Disagree because of the fact, I Know what it's like to be behind on everything, and yet still be good at a sport, the sport is what made me keep trying my best in school, but sometimes, a student may have a bad day, and one bad day is all it takes in order to make the B go down to a C.

I agree we want the best for children, but sometimes children need a break, no ones perfect, and if they get the one thing that they are good at taken away, they might loose their patience for everything.

I Believe if the students trying their hardest and keep it above a C, then they should be able to play sports. Being active is something a person needs in life, and if they're to busy with their studies then they won't have time to get active.

A child needs to be able to plan there schedule out, including study time, and play time.

I also believe if you were to change the average that we wouldn't make as much money for SCHOOL_NAME because of the fact, students wont have a good average, which means they won't be able to try out for a sport, which means no money given to the funds from the child.

We need the best we can at SCHOOL_NAME, and change, it's just something we don't need.

I apologize if you don't agree with my words, but SCHOOL_NAME is doing great already. It's rated excellent, so why try to change it ?

I believe that children need sports to get that big test coming up off their mind, if they don't stress about it then they will have the opportunity to do well.

Take it from a child herself, just because we're young and careless, doesn't mean we don't want the best in life for ourselves.

People make mistakes, and you changing the average would be a big one.

I know a lot of cheerleaders and basketball players, who barely pass to stay in their sport, but when they're on that court, or on that field, etc, they look as happy as can be and they do a great job.

If you take the chance on having a good time in school, then students will start skipping, not wanting to go, and before you know it, we have 10x as many homeless people who could of had sports careers.

I'm not saying that every single student is going to fail if you make this a rule, but i promise you, students will stop coming and stop even trying to make something out of life because you took it away.

I'm only 13 myself, and I have been in a sport called High-Steppers'. It was the best thing I ever did in my life, I got fit, had fun, didn't have as much time on my hands as if I would if i wasn't in the sport.

Oh, and what about the fact that it takes up students time, and there's less of the chance of students experimenting with drugs, sexual content, and tobacco usage.

So as you can see, I have a lot of reasoning on why you shouldn't change the schools average for sports. I love SCHOOL_NAME just the way it is, and so do many others.

Well here is my argument and I hope you take time and think, actually think before you make any decisions. Have a great day.

Sincerely,

-STUDENT_NAME
