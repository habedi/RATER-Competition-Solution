There have been many claims out there that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. This idea seem very crazy since aliens don't exist. I think the that the Face is just a natural landform.

On May 24, 2001, the day the face was discovered, people said that the Face resembled a humans face, not an alien. A few days later NASA unveiled images for everyone to see while captioning it "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth." The landform was just formed by shadow, which means this just gives others the illusion that it's a face, but it is just a natural landform. There were no alien to create this and it is only made naturally. Many out there have created movies, books and magazine article on the Face but this is all just bandwagon, trying to just sell their products and make money out of false theories. Later on, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew to Mars to take more photgraphs of the Face, when thousands of people were waiting for the end result to confirm that the Face was just a natural landorm. Since people were'nt satified, Mars Global Surveyor flew back to Mars in April of 2001. With many photos take, the Face did indeed look like a human or alien face, but there are no sitings of such things.

In conclusion, all the Face really is is just a naturally created landform with shadows that create the illusion of a face of a human/alien.
