Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is an opportunity of a life time. The places you get to go, experiance you gain, and the fun to be had is all to much to pass up. It opened up a whole new world to me and a lot of other people.

If it weren't for the Seagoing Cowboys Program, I wouldn't have visited half of the places I have in my whole entire life. While on the job, I had time to visit Greece, Italy, China, Crete, and many other countries. I even got to sail the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean 2 times!

Another reason that you should join is the amazing experiance you'll gain. When I first joined, I had a tiny bit of experiance with animals from helping out at my Aunt Katie's farm. But even if you don't have a little bit of a backround with helping out animals, you'll have all of the knowledge you'll need just by taking one trip. Being in the Seagoing Cowboys program also taught me about all of the dangers there are at sea.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is the fun you get to have. Yes, you do have to work hard and still get the job done correctly. But after the job has been completed, you can play games with the other cowboys. For instance, I used to play a lot of baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Other stuff that helped pass the time were table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Now that you've read why I recommend you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, (especially for the places you go, experiance you gain, and fun you get to have) I hope that you will consider my point. It really cahanged me for the better, and I thing it will change you, too.
