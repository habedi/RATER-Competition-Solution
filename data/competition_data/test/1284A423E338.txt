Dear Principal,

Policy one is the best decision other than taking them away permanently. what if there was an emergency and the student can not reach a phone, what would they do if they had no cell phone. What if the power goes out and they need to go home early but the phones don't work. Cell phones are a necessity in life, without them how would someone contact there family or the authority if they where injured or if they were being robbed by a criminal. Every day could be your last but if you have a way to contact someone of the situation then it might not be as bad. Even if you think your safe you can never be sure.

Some kids have family that are in the U.S Army, and those family members can only contact their families at certain time periods. That small time could be the last they ever talk to them and if they don't have a cell phone how will they talk to them. This is only one of the many reasons why the students should have cell phones. This is a very important subject that needs to be dealed with quickly and should be thought through.

If the students do not follow directions and take out their phones severe punishment should be followed. Cells phones are useful but it is a privilege to be allowed to use them. To ensure that the rules are followed signs should be put up where it is alright to use phones and where it is not.
