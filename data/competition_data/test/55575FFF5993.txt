Dear Principal,

I am asking you can you please let us bring our phone to school. We will never text threw class. The only time that we will used our phone is when we are going to the next class or for break. That's why we are asking you can bring them. Let me tell you why.

The reason why we need them is because we are bored when we go to other class. You want have no more fights at school. The kids will be more quite. Everybody want say that no one stole there stuff they will have there own. We will learn more into school kids will start coming to school everyday. There will be no more drop out. You want have to tell the kids to be quite or don't do this. You will be resting your nerves.

The other reason why you should let us bring our phone to school what if there's a emergency and we cant get to the phone. What if there something important is going on with family and they get hurt there self because they was not there for there family. What if we are sick and the teacher want let us out of the classroom and we are hurting real bad then what that lead to mess and i know that you don't want that on your hand. So what you going to say. That is the reason why you should let us bring our phone to school.

Sincerely,

Your Student
