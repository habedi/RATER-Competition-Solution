The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. There are more facts to prove that aliens have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. There are less facts to prove that aliens did it. Use commen sense. Don't assume somethig without having facts to back it up.

The first fact that tells us that it was not aliens is, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth." This tells us that aliens didn't make it, and that it just formed from shadows that made it look like a face on mars when it was just an illusion.

In the text it states, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

Furthermore, the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. "it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

Those were some facts that tell us that aliens didn't have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. It was just an illusion. It made people wonder if there was life on Mars or if there use to be an ancient civilzation on Mars. But, in the end it was just a rock formation. There are more facts to back up that aliens didn't do it. There are less facts to prove that aliens did do it. People saw the picture of the Face on Mars and assumed it had to do with aliens since it looked so much like a face. But, its best to not assume something before you have strong facts to back it up. The Face on Mars isn't forgotten though. It's still something amazing that happend on Mars. It was the first time that something so amazing was caught on camara on Mars. It might never be seen again. We can always remember it as the Face on Mars.
