In my opinion limiting the usage of cars would be great. Some people use there viechles for the stupidest reasons when they could walk or even ride a bike. It would be better for our enviorment and even people. some advantageas of limting car usage would be cleaner air and people would get excercise.

Alright we'll who wants to be in town and smell the nasty fumes of a car? Not me i would love to smell the fresh air. When you limit the usage of cars  this could happen not only would you hvae clean air but the people around you would be satified with the results. According to the article"Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" they claim "Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." With this being said happier people may give people a chance to get job or even have a better enviorment to be around.

In addition people could get excersise from limiting car usage. when people get excersise it means the obiesity levels can go down and make the place better for everyone. also from people having an activity they dint have ti sit on there butt anymore. They can actualy get up and attemp to find a job to benifit their family and the community.

In conclusion people can benifit from this no car usage rule from having cleaner and get exersise. those all play a factor in each other.
