I think policy 1 should be allowed because they can us there phones but during class everyone is fine without texting or whatever there doing. If we didn't have phones at our school there would be nothing else to do at lunch or when you have free time to do what you want to do. But if they get caught with it out during class then they would have to play a fee to get it back. Also if we could use it all day no one would pay attention in class they would be on there phone all day but we should be able to use them most of the day. An plus if we did have our phones out all day people would be cheating on test an texting friends in other classes an distracting them from what there doing, but that's why we shouldn't have them out all the time just sometimes like lunch and in the hallways, but if like someone's mom calls we should be able to awnser it in case if its an emergency.

I think that policy 2 is kind of over board because now days people cant stand not being without there phones so its like our baby's to us. if we didn't have them today our technology wouldn't be like it is today, but as i was saying we should be able to have our phones because its all us kids do is play on our phones an we have nothing else to do. Also we could use our phones for like emailing a teacher for our homework or asking how were doing in class if there's something wrong that i need to fix.
