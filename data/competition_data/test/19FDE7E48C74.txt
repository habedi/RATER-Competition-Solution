Extracurricular activities are a way for students to express their interests, build relationships with their peers, and be active in their school community. Unfortunately, the school day and homework take up a large portion of the day, and not all students have the time or energy to participate in optional activities. There might be pressure from people at home or at school to preform well in a specific activity, or the school might not offer a program that fits the interests or needs of a student. Even though downsides are apparent, is there enough positive aspects to extracurricular activities that they should be required?

At Generic_School, there is a wide variety of activities and clubs offered for students from grades seven through twelve. Many students are able to find a club that they enjoy, and make attending that activity a part of their weekly routine. However, there are some students who just can't find the right club for them, or don't have the motivation. Sometimes they are busy with other activities outside of school such as sports or practicing a hobby, and they can't find any room in their schedule for more activities. Requiring everybody to participate in extracurricular activities would give some students the motivation they need to find a club that they really enjoy, but it could also force others to give up an aspect of their routine at home so they could have time to participate in activities at school. This would be especially devastating to a student who is training hard to become an athlete, or practicing a hobby they really enjoy, because they would have to give that up to choose from a variety of activities that they may have no interest in participating in.

Extracurricular activities can be very productive and enjoyable for any student, but only in the right setting. When a student decides that they want to commit to a club, they are more likely to work hard and enjoy themselves while participating. A student whose parent or principal tells them they must participate won't enjoy themselves, and will probably make the experience worse for everyone else around them. While an unmotivated student is wasting time in a club, they could be exploring an interest at home, or developing a skill set that one day could turn into their career. A student might select yearbook, but have no interest in journalism. A student could choose to participate in the student government, but not have any ideas for the school. While they aren't being productive, there could be another student who was denied a spot in their favorite program, all because someone who wasn't interested in the topic was required to sign up. Requiring extracurricular activities could take time away from productive activities elsewhere, and deny passionate students a chance at their dreams.

Students should all have a chance to be an active member of their school community, and have the freedom to choose what they participate in. Not everyone is aware the benefits of participating in extracurricular programs, and schools should make the student body aware of them, but they should not be required. Schools could encourage participation by offering a variety of activities, getting feedback from students on what needs to change, and advertising that extracurricular activities can be a fun way to meet new people, and learn more about a subject you're interested in. Providing students with a way to expand their knowledge and practice something they find interesting is a great way to inspire them to work hard. As soon as it becomes a requirement, students will begin to loose interest. Schools need to strongly encourage extracurricular activities, but not require them.
