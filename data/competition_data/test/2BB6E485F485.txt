Texting And Driving Should Be Banned

Every year distracted driving causes approximately 1.5 million crashes, 400 thousand injuries, and nearly 3000 deaths, but there are still some states that feel it is unnecessary to ban texting and driving. Fourteen percent of all fatal crashes involved cell phones, but there are still some states that feel it is unnecessary to ban texting and driving. Distracted driving costs approximately $129 billion per year, but despite all of this, there are still some states that feel it is unnecessary to ban texting and driving. It is absolutely necessary to ban texting and driving to prevent the deaths and waste of resources it causes.

Texting and driving is dangerous. A vehicle travelling at 60mph will move 88 feet in just one second. This means that if the driver looks away from the road for even a single second, they will have moved 88 feet by the time they look back. When moving at high speeds in a vehicle, a lot can happen in a single second. The vehicle could drift off the road, hit another vehicle, or even hit a pedestrian. When a driver sends or receives a text, they're not looking away from the road for just one second, or even two seconds. They're looking away from the road for five seconds.

Five seconds at 60mph is 440 feet. That's 440 feet the driver has moved without even looking at the road. This is something that happens every time someone looks at their phone to send or receive a text. This is unsafe and should be banned.

Texting and driving, though it is banned in most states, is not uncommon. Three quarters of drivers who own a cell phone have admitted to texting and driving, despite the overwhelming majority of them knowing about the dangers. At any given time 7% of drivers are using their phones while driving. The knowledge that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to deter most people. Simply informing people that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to prevent them from doing it; texting and driving must be banned everywhere in the country.

Texting and driving significantly increases the risk of a car accident, and accounts for a significant amount of actual accidents. Fourteen percent of all car accidents are associated with texting and driving, and it is the leading cause of car accidents, even more common than drunk driving. When a driver is texting while driving the amount of time their eyes are off the road increases significantly, by about 400%. Avoiding texting and driving could reduce the amount of time the driver has with their eyes off the road to a quarter and reduce the chances of an accident.

Texting and driving causes 3000 deaths per year in the United States alone, and costs $129 billion per year. Every year many of the people that die as a result of texting and driving are drivers other than those who are texting. Often it's passengers, pedestrians, and even other drivers who are killed by distracted driving, but most deaths are the drivers themselves. The resources that have been lost because of distracted driving could have gone to something that could help people. But instead it is wasted because distracted driving has caused car accidents that cost a significant amount of money. Distracted driving causes many deaths and wastes a lot of resources that could be used to help people.

Distracted driving is a major issue, but unfortunately, there are still some people who feel it should not be banned. It is still legal in three states and there are no national laws making it illegal. Despite 3000 deaths per year, $129 billion wasted, and it being the leading cause of accidents it is still not banned in some places. Texting while driving should be banned.
