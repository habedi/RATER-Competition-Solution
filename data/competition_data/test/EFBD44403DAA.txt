The face of Mars is a natural landform. It has become what they call pop icon. There was an alien sight theorolists say on Mars called the NASA. But i disagree with them.

The NASA on Mars would rather hide says theorists.

But i think they can't hide. You must have water to survive and if their is no water on Mars then nothing can live on that planet. Earth has water so humans, animals and plants can survive but not Mars. The picture in the passage looks like a face but it could just be a bump on the planet that somehow looked like a face.

At some point Mars might of had living creatures but not anymore. I personally think that Mars might have had something living thousands or hundreds of years ago. From all the research shown i think they might have had a few humans then they maybe died of thurst. We might need more evidence before the world will believe that their was life on Mars.
