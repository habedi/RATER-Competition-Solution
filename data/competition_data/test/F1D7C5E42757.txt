Dear TEACHER_NAME,

How are you doing today? I would like to give you my opinion on kids doing community service. I think it is a good idea for kids to do community service despite what they want to do. Community service shows discipline, dedication, and leadership. Today I will be explaining why I think community service should be required for all students. Please sit back, relax, and read along.

The first reason why I think students should be required to do community is because it teaches discipline. It teaches discipline because it keeps you focus and not letting you get caught up. For example, there is so many negative things going on these days, and if you are doing something good with your time, you don't have time for the negativity. It also shows discipline because community service is something that you have to do consisting, so community service is something that you have to do, and be dedicated to doing it. This is my first reason why I think all students should be required to do community service.

Next, community service teaches students how to be a good citizen. By doing community service for along time, eventually students will start picking up trash, helping people, and things like that when their not doing community service. They do those things because that is just the person they have become from doing community service. Community service teaches a lot of good things and how to be good citizen is one of them. Citizenship is a great quality to have.

Lastly, community service shows leadership. It shows leadership because some of the students friends might not be doing it, but for a student to still do it, that is showing leadership. Also because in your neighborhood your being a leader by, picking up trash, helping
