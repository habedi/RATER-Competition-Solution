It would be an amazing experience to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it would be an opportunity of a lifetime. According to the text, Luke said, "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water." The text also says that he toured a castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Also, if you worked on one of those boats, you would be helping people in need in other countries. The text states that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. And lastly, being a Seagoing Cowboy changed Luke's life. In conclusion, I think it would be a good decision to join the Seagoing Cowboys and go on a life-changing adventure.
