Participation in Extracurricular Activities

"Click, click." That is the sound of a camera being pressed in yearbook club. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can learn new skills, make new friends, and it is a way to use up time.

Students can learn a lot of new skills. If a student has never even touched a camera, they can learn. The student could be in photography club and now have a great picture taking technique. Being in a extracurricular activity will surely improve their social skills. They will be able to hang out with kids who have the same interests as them. Another reason is that your kid might even be the best kicker to ever kick but they have no idea how to play soccer. Enrolling them in the sport is a good way for them to make use of their talent. Children can discover new skills everyday, so helping them master it in extracurricular activities will help them be successful.

Joining an activity after school is a great way to make new friends. Students will be with people who share the same interests as them. Their current friends might not understand their passion for certain things. Doing something they love will people who also love it will make it a better experience. Experiencing something with someone who can't appreciate it would not be fun. Sometimes students don't have any friends within their class. Making friends with kids who they don't have to see everyday would be nice for them. Students in activities will make long lastingÂ friendships and be able to express themselves.

However, sometimes it might seem like a hassle just to get to the activities. Having to get back to school from home would be hard for most families. This is why they set up a system where the students can stay at school until their activity is over and then get picked up by their parents or get dropped off by a late school bus. This way, parents don't need to stress about getting them back to school. The school cares very much about the students and wouldn't want them to feel left out if they can't get a ride.

Students should all be enrolled in extracurricular activities for various reasons. Learning new skills and making new friends is a big part of why having students in extracurricular activities is so crucial. Kids need to be able to have a time where they can do something fun of their choosing.
