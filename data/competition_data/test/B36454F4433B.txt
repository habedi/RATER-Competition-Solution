I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea. It can have it's pros and cons but I think that the pros overdue the cons. Three reasons why I think it's a good idea is because it tells you how someone might be feeling, if they are lying about how they feel or not, and that if they don't want to tell you, you can figure it out.

First of all, do you ever wonder on how might one person might be feeling? I bet you have. using the Facial Action Coding System can help with that. It can be hard because if you really care about someone and you might wonder how they are feeling. You can ask but what if they don't want to talk about it because it makes them uncomfortable.

Second of all, what if you ask a friend on how they are feeling and they say they are fine, but clearly they are't. People can lie about how they are feeling. They might show something but deny they are feeling some type of way.

Lastly, what if they don't want to tell you but you really want to know so you can help. the system can help with that. It would be much easier because now you don't have to ask and make them feel moe of what they are feeling.

In conclusion, I think that the Facial Action Coding system is a really great idea. It would probably take a long time for mostly everyone to have that system. But in the future there will be some type of system like that, that everyone can afford and have.
