TEACHER_NAME,

I think that we should be aloud to bring our phones to school as long as we don't use them during class. There are many reasons why and why not to bring our phones to school. But i think that option one is the best option to be used.

If we don't take our phones to school then teachers and students don't have to worry about many things. Like if the student caries their phone in their purse or pocket while they are in class then they would be taking the risk of having their phone go off and having it taken away by the teachers. If there is no phones at school then the students wouldn't get in trouble for their phones going off.

There are a lot of students with phones now a days and a lot of them take their phone to school. Witch would be alright if they didn't text during class. I don't know how many people i see in my classes that have their phone out texting. Then the teachers get mad because they are standing there doing their jobs and teaching when they students aren't even listening.

But there are reasons for students to have their phones also. A lot of students have their phones at school because they have parents that work all day and their parents need them to contact them if they need something or if something happened. A lot of students take that in advantage though and start texting their friends during classes.

I disagree that there should be no phones at school, but the students need their phones off in their locker or in their purses or pockets. Then the problem of phones going off during class would decrease. And the students would actually learn what their teachers are teaching them.
