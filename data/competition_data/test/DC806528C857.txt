Driverless cars are going to be a hassle. People would have to first, learn how to use all the different buttons, and learn how it all worked. Then, if there were to be a wreck, whose fault is it? The driver's or the driverless car? I have a feeling that the so called "driver" would get blamed, unless they actually have it proven right that it was the "driver". It would take longer for people to get places, because it can only handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. I feel as if these cars will be a distraction to society, and more wrecks may be caused. People are not going to be alert with driverless cars because they are going to think that because it has all of these warning signs and sensors, that they won't neccessarily have to pay an attention. So, therefore I do not think that driverless cars are a good idea.
