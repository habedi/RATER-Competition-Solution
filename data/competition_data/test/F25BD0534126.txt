Yes I do feel that kids should do sports but this isnt my choice to make. The principle should not be able to ethier it is against are laws. In this cuntrey we have the right to have a choice and vote, and that cant be taken away.

Now I do feel that kids are not getting out into the world enough. This is because of technolgy, kids dont want to go outside with there friends. kids are staying inside playing video games, and that is a fact. Now a mix of both is great and brings the best of both worlds to are comunity.

People have the right to chose, and if you are taking away this then you are taking away from rights. It is a great idea, but it won't work all of the time, because kids have things to do when they get home. And if they are already playing sports outside of school, how are they going to fit this into there schedule. The school does not know what they do at home so how can they expect them to do homework and everthing else in just one week.

This issue can be fixed, by sending home a letter. This letter will ask the parents if they can make the kids play sports. This will eliminate the issue because parents can say if they play a sport already. And if they already are busy, and cant, then they dont have to do a sport or an activity after school.

All in all this is a great thing and a horrible thing because it does not always work. Kids need the right of choice, it is an essintial right, that we even as adults need. But kids also need to get outside into the world and ,sweat, workout, and play. with this comprimise I have shown teachers, and parents can figure this out. With my take on this issue I feel I have coverd all ground, and have shown what needs to be done to make the parents and the principle comprimise.
