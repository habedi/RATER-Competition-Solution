Are students given enough freedom in school classrooms? Students attend school for approximately 180 days each school year. However, the work does not stop just because summer break begins. Teachers often assign specific projects to students at the end of each school year for them to complete by the time they go back to school in the fall. These projects can include reading a book, writing an essay, or completing worksheets. While some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more freedom, it is best for teachers to design these projects because they know what will benefit students the most and it is less inconvenient for teachers and students.

Teachers only assign students work that they know will benefit the students. Students may view summer projects as useless, extra work, but teachers always have reasons for assigning assignments. Many teachers' reasons for assigning summer projects is to prepare students for the following school-year. A vast majority of schools offer advanced placement courses which are very challenging and rigorous classes. In order to give students an introduction to what the class is like, teachers often assign summer projects. This helps the students in the long-run because they are given exposure to the course ahead of time.

Having student-designed projects is too much of a hassle for teachers and students. Adopting student-designed projects would require each individual student to brainstorm ideas for their summer project. Not only does it take even more time out of students' summer lives, but it also creates more work for teachers. If each student were to design their own project, teachers would have to grade each project using a different set of eyes. Each project would be unique, meaning teachers would not be able to use the same set of standards for all projects. Without having a standard list of requirement, students would not know if their project met the requirements and it would take teachers forever to grade the projects. Having one uniform assignment for all students would relieve much stress from teachers' and students' lives.

Some may argue that student-designed projects give students more freedom. Each student is creative in their own way and some may say that students are not given enough opportunities to utilize their creativity in school. Allowing students to design their summer projectsÂ would make it more enjoyable while also still learning. However, students do not always do things that are in their best interest. Instead, they take the easy-way-out.

Overall, it is in everyone's best interest to have teacher-designed summer projects. It creates less stress for teachers, and it prepares students for the next school year. Students are given freedom in the classroom in many other ways, and adding student-designed projects would make classrooms even less structured. Teacher-designed projects are beneficial to both teachers and students, and they should be used in all classrooms.
