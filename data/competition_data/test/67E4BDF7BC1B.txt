Dear Principal,

You and your co-workers have been considering to change the policy regarding the grades a student has to earn to be able to play sports. The grade average will be changed to having at least a B average to play sports, instead of the prior grade average, a C. In my opinion, I agree that the policy should be changed.

There are many reasons as to why the policy should be different. One argument that you could make is that it would encourage students to work harder on their education. If they are not able to make the grades that are required, then they will not be able to play the sports that they enjoy. Giving the students this extra push to succeed will help them later on in life. For example, colleges are concerned in not only one's athletic capabilities, but also their academic qualities. I believe that a college would not accept someone who is an amazing athlete, but can only maintain a below average grade. Exchanging the grade average from a C to a B to play sports can help the student body in the future.

Another reason that the grading average should be changed is that it could help the sports teams out. If the team has players that can asses a situation and think things through, then the team will be successful. One thing that teachers can all agree on is that to make it in this world, you have to be able to analyze a situation and find the best resolution for that problem. For instance, if there is a soccer team and the forward is dribbling the ball, and he/she asks themselves whether they should shoot the ball to score a goal, or pass the ball to another player, they will need to be able to make the better choice. Being able to quickly think things through will allow them to make the proper decision. This skill can be taught by our thoughtful teachers in the classroom. The capability of making decisions that benefit everyone is a skill that the sports teams could learn by keeping a B average grade.

Some people may disagree. They say that it is unfair to not include players with a C average. People argue that some of the best players have those grades, and that it would hurt the teams to reject them. When they say this I would like you to ask yourself this; "Do the players with a C average deserve to be on a sports team?"

The average grade to be on a sports team should be a B. It could benefit students in the future and it could even help the sports teams think more efficiently. It would be extremely foolish to allow a low grade such as a C to be tolerated at our school.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
