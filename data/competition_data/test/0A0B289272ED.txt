Have you ever come back to school after a long summer break and forgot everything you previously learned? Than you probably had an easy summer project if you had one at all. Many teachers let their students off easy for summer thinking they need a break, but what they are really doing is setting them up for failure for the following year. Although some may believe otherwise student preparedness, teacher support, and students using previously learned information prove that teacher should design summer projects.

If a teacher designs a summer assignment it will most likely introduce students to things they will learn the next year. This will provide students with an opportunityÂ to be ahead at the start of the following year and make it easier for teachers too. Teachers would not have to spend as much time teaching the students things they already learned, they can just review it and go onto harder material. This will also give students a base for the start of the following year and they will already know what to expect. Some people believe that students should have a break during the summer although I agree, you are going to have to do an assignment even if it is made by students or the teacher, so why not get a head start on the next year. This will also allow students to pull from knowledge they already have.

A good summer assignment will allow students to use what they learned the previous year. If a student is able to use what they already learned their is a much higher chance that they wont forget it. One of the worst feelings in school is when the teacher is reviewing things you need to know from the previous year and you forgot most if not all of it. Why would you want to take a class for a year and not retain the information you need to know. Doing an assignment in the summer, even if it does not pertain to the information you learned will keep your brain active and give you a better chance of remembering what you learned. Some people would say that if a student really learned the information in school than they do not need a summer assignment, But many students do not learn everything to the extent that they need to to be able to remember it the next year. One of the main reasons students dont complete summer projects is because they cant. If the students create the assignment than the teacher can not help.

If a teacher creates a summer assignment than they can give the students videos or websites that can help them. This can support the student since there will be no teacher present to help them. If students create the project than the teacher will not be able to help them at all. If students create the project some students may believe the project that they created is easy, but it is difficult for some students to learn without the support of a teacher or video. Teachers creating the assignment will make it so they can complete their project in a timely manner and still enjoy summer. Some people would say that students should have easy summer assignments that dont require assistance but this is proven wrong every year by students who do not remember previous information.

Many students do not do the summer assignment assigned to them or cram it all to the last minute because it is normally just busy work. If summer projects were assigned by teachers than they would most likely be work to help you with the upcoming year and help you remember. If this was the case than most productive students would realize the value of them and work on them in a timely manner. If students did their part by completing the assignment and teachers gave out assignments that help summer projects will no longer be looked at as busy work but as a tool to recall information and give you a head start. If students created the assignment than it would continue being looked at as busy work and a waste of time.
