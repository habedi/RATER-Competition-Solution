With the advancement in technology increasing, many once manual tasks have become digitized, and more and more places are beginning to incorporate technology into their surrounding. Schools have been impacted the most by this surge of technology, and many schools are taking advantage of it. The idea of distance learning has been introduced to some schools, and allows students to learn from home and take courses online via online or video conferencing. Many wonder if distance learning would be beneficial to students, and some even argue against it, claiming that learning should not depend on technology. Distance learning would be beneficial to students, because it allows for fewer distractions and creates a more personalized learning experience.

Firstly, being able to take classes at home provides less room for distraction. Often times, a classroom setting can be difficult to focus in, and many students are unable to complete assignments. Teachers spend a good portion of classes either trying to teach over the noise of students' conversations, or trying to calm the class down. While there are many students that want to hear what the teacher has to say, the sad truth is that there are also many who don't care. Some even go so far as to make unnecessary outbursts, or try to start conversations with individuals around them, without taking into consideration that they might want to learn. In the case of distance learning, students can learn from home, which means that they can learn in a peaceful environment, free of disruptions caused by obnoxious kids. Another example of distractions within the classroom is comfort level. Many students find that it is more difficult to perform in class if they are uncomfortable. Considering how many kids are usually in a school, it is understandable that many students are put in uncomfortable situations. For example, some teachers won't allow more than one student to go to the bathroom at a time. This creates an issue, because some people ask for a bathroom pass and never come back, which in turn means that no one else is allowed to use the restroom, even if they need to. The distraction of discomfort would not be as much of an issue in a home, because students are free to do what they need, to make themselves comfortable without many of the restrictions found in schools. Learning at home eliminates a majority of these distractions, and allows students to learn in an environment where they can focus easier.

In addition, the more personalized learning experience that comes with distance learning would allow students to be taught information more effectively. With distance learning, students can work at their own pace and focus on the areas that they are having trouble with. In class, sometimes students feel embarrassed to ask questions, or ask for help when they need it, because they don't want to seem 'dumb' to others. Learning online may make students more comfortable with asking for help, because they can do so in an environment free ofÂ judgment. On the other end of the spectrum, some children do exceptionally well in certain areas, so distance learning can allow them to move on to other areas, without having to wait for a teacher. In both cases, distance learning would be beneficial, because students could work at the pace most comfortable to them. Another aspect of personalized learning is a one-on-one setting. Many classrooms only have one teacher to teach a class with twenty or more students. This means that the teacher has to find a way to communicate that accommodates the most amount of people, and as an effect, a good portion of students do not fully understand the topic, and may not be able to get the teacher's attention in time to clarify. Taking classes online will enable students to make sure that they understand the topic, because they can clarify things that they are confused about, and have however much time that they need to process and retain the information.

In conclusion, many of the issues found in a traditional school environment are mostly, if not entirely, eliminated with distance learning. Students can learn within the comforts of their own homes, free of distraction, and can create the optimal learning environment for themselves. The flexibility of online courses will also allow students to work at their own pace and ensure that they understand the material, because they are free to put extra time in areas they need more help with and not have to allot equal time to all areas, even if they've mastered it. Distance learning would help students learn more efficiently and effectively and should be in place at every school.
