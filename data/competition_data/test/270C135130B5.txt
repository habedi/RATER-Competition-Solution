To my principal,

I think policy two is the best way to go.

The use of cell phones in school would be a great idea.

I feel it gives the students a better advantage in their social life.

It is fine to have the phones in class, but the students should not be on them while the class is going on.

The use of your phone during free time seems like a wonderful idea. It gives the students something to do during the break period in school.

But with this opportunity comes rules that will have to be followed, if the students wish to continue having phones. The phones are allowed but they shall remain off in your classrooms, they are not to be ringing at any point of the day. It shall remain on silent or vibrate. If theses rules can not be followed this privilege will be revoked. If you will have the students and their parent sign some type of agreement. Stating that they are aware of these guidelines, everything shall be all good.

The use of cell phones would be a wonderful thing for you students. If you allow this, we will try our absolute best to follow the rules and regulations that you have set.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
