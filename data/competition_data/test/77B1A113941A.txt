Some schools think it is a good idea to require students to complete a project over the summer. Many people would probably agree with this to assure that all students continue to learn over the break. The main question is weather the students should design the project or the schools and teachers should. There would be pros and cons to both decisions but what would be best for the students. Most students would likely would dread this project because it is something that is required to be completed over the summer when they should be getting a break. I think that if you wanted to ensure each student completes it then they should be the ones that design it, so it is in their best interest and it will be something that they want to do well on.

Summer break is something that is needed for students to get a relaxing break from all the stress of school; one thing that would make it less so is having them complete a summer project. A summer project is obviously something students don't want to be worrying about during a break. If teachers designed the projects students will have much less interest and it will be looked at it as something that needs to be completed as a school project. If you have the student design the project it will be looked at in a totally different way. The project would now be something that they would want to complete for themselves. They would work harder on it and be proud of the work they have done.

Another reason making the projects student designed is the best option is because some students coming from low class families don't have the materials at home to complete it or even possibly the money to buy them. When designing the project the student should and will keep this in mind so that they can ensure they have the right materials at home and if not they will make sure there is a way they can obtain them. Another problem they could run into is that there might not be adequate internet at home or even none at all. Research is a primary resource when trying to complete a project and without internet connection that is a very difficult task. Students with this issue would ensure that no research is needed or that they already know lots about the topic of their project.

One main reason that summer projects should be student designed is the students could pick a topic that they have a passion about or a hobby they enjoy. If the teacher designs the project then it could be on a topic or about something they student doesn't enjoy or has no interest in. With a summer project the students designed themselves would have a drive to complete it over the summer, and not only would they complete it they would do their best work. Having a project that students designed they would want to see it completed and see it done the best way possible.

With everything meticulously thought about and taken into account student designed is for sure they right decision if teachers want properly completed projects. With the students designing the projects there are many benefits from students actually completing it to being able to afford the materials. With student designed projects it will ensure that they complete them and enjoy the process of completing them, and once they are done they will be proud of what the have completed.
