Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this letter regarding all students pitching in on community service. I however think that every student should put in 3 hours of community service each week. Students should be rewarded by a pizza party or something special. Students who do not put in 3 hours of service should miss out on the fun. Instead of going to the party they will clean up the highways.

I do not think it is that hard to put in 3 hours of community service. Students should like helping their community and making it better. However many students do not think students should have to do 3 hours because it would interfere with their social, educational, and sports life.

Some rewards could be a pizza party, school dance, movie night, and a game night. I think students would do more community service if they got some type of reward. Even though they shouldn't have a reward for doing something voluntary.

What they could do to volunteer is work at a soup kitchen, clean up garbage from the highways, and have a bake sale and all profits go to needy families or to the hospital for cancer research.

Please consider my idea. Keep in mind that students should do community service. Not just for their self's but for others. Thank you for your time in reading my letter.

Thanks,

STUDENT_NAME
