Phone & Driving

When driving sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they can create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Clark veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy Buzz Maven Labs, says he came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on their phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph. Drivers who use cell phones while driving is also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person life, but she made a poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with the rest of her life.
