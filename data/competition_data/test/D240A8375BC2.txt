At every school there are extracurricular activities other wise know as clubs. Clubs are after school activities that any student can join. I remember joining a club for the first time, I remember how scared I was because I didn't know anyone there, but looking back at it now, I'm so glad I did it. It gave me my love for volleyball now and I gained so many good friends out of it. Have you ever joined a club that you loved?

Extracurricular activities can let your mindset be creative if you didn't have the chance to be in regular school hours. Clubs let you think outside of the box, artistic clubs like theater, art/drawing, engineering, and more are ways to help your mind explore your imagination.

Clubs also give you a lot of social interactions with people you don't know. It's a way to make new friends, like being on a sports team. That's a great way of being social because, when you're on a team you create a bond with them every time you play a game. Wherever the game might be, on a field, court, rink, you always need to communicate with your teammates to keep the game going. Clubs also give you a way to learn better in school, there are a ton of after school clubs that help tutor kids that really need it. Extracurricular activities also help you concentrate better, for example chess club or golf. When you're in a chess match or golf game, everyone needs to be completely silent so the player can concentrate on the goal of winning.

Another reason for having extracurricular activities is that they are for everyone. There is at least one club for everyone that a person can be interested in, and even if there aren't any clubs that you like the greatest thing is, is that you can make your own club. You can present your club idea to the principle and school board and if they agree on making it a club, then boom, there you go a club that has all your interests.

Clubs also give you so many huge chances for the future. For example if your not sure on a career choice you can join a club that seems fun to you and if you like it you could possibly decide on a career just like that club. Clubs help you find interests that you didn't even know you had. Another example on how clubs can help you are sports, sports help you stay active and in shape. A huge reason why clubs can help you in the future, are scholarships. Being on a sports team can help you get a scholarship into a college, a college scout can come out to your hometown to watch you play in your game and if you are good enough and meet the standards their looking for in an athlete, you could possibly get a scholarship to a college.

As a result from learning that extracurricular activities can help you be creative, social, and help you so greatly for the future, I agree with the principle that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, after all it could lead you to so many wonderful things.
