Schools deciding to give projects over the summer, should allow their students to design their own unique project. Teachers providing the project will most likely cause frustration in students. This could stem from a subject that is boring or they they do not like. Also, students do not want to spend all summer doing school work, so this will give students a more enjoyable learning experience. Requiring students to create their summer projects will allow students to enjoy their assignment, help them learn more efficient, and increase student responsibility.

Letting students design their own summer project will give students a more enjoyable experience with their project. Most likely, students will choose a topic that they like. This motivates them to accomplish their project because they will want to learn more about their favorite food, theme park, or animal. If teachers were to pick students topics, then teachers would pick a plain boring subject. This would make students feel made to do it, which will decrease the chances of them finishing it. Also, doing a project on a hobby or favorite snack allows students to experiment with it to conclude valuable data. This gives students evidence to why they enjoy their hobby or favorite snack. Overall, allowing students to create their own project will create a better and more enjoyable atmosphere.

Also, schools giving their students the right to create their own summer assignment helps students learn more efficient. More importantly, students that struggle to learn or focus will find these projects easier. It will also help them learn more and remember the information on the project. Students coming up with their own ideas gets them more excited, because they are not being forced to do their project on a topic they know anything about. This excitement to learn more about a topic creates a more efficient working environment, which helps students complete assignments. Also, students given summer projects by teachers will decrease the value of the project. Most students will find shortcuts or acquire help from a another student, sibling, or parent. However, students picking their own project will push them to gather the data on their own.

In addition, allowing students to design their own summer project will increase responsibility. Most people have been given everything since they were born, whether that be food, a home, or as small as a homework assignment. Yet, this makes people dependent on people to do things for them. However, giving students the right to create and accomplish their own project establishes responsibility in their life. They have to come up with the topic, gather data, and be able to show it on a poster or power point, all while having to finish in a certain amount of time. Students grasping the importance of responsibility will only prepare them for college and a job. The people and students with it succeed more often, because they have good time management, do their job, and understand its importance.

Having students create their own project, benefits them abundantly. It creates a better learning enviorment, while establishing importances in their life. Teachers creating the project for the students is no different from the school year students just faced. However, giving students some responsibility to accomplish a simple summer project is more than just a grade.
