Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be helping and doing community service. My reasons for this are it will lets kids get out more and meet new people, some kids will get more exercise, for some it will help on a college application, and others could learn a sense of respect.

All student should have a certain amount of community service time a week and they should have to complete it or they will be punished. Such as they would need to pay a fine or for the school they would have a detention or even suspension. If you realize kids aren't doing community service and they keep getting punished then you could start something where their is a certain amount of hours a week you need to do, you can randomly pick kids for each week to do it so not everyone is doing it a week. If you occur to have a problem with kids not doing it then you could count it as a grade and it will effect their school work, then some people might be more cautious about what they are doing. you could also make some exceptions so if someone were to be going away for that week they could be moved to the next week.

I feel if kids would be required to do this then they can choose what they would like to do. Such as some could go around picking up litter or some could help at an animal shelter or at a food drive, depending on what they like. Some kids may enjoy doing community help so then you could have the option of letting kids do extra hours. some kids enjoy working with animals so they would maybe want to do the animal shelter but if the same people keep choosing the same thing it wouldn't be very fair to the kids who are doing things they don't like every week. I think you should not be able to pick the same thing 2 times in a row .
