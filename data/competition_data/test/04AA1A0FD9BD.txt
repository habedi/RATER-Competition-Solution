In "Driverless Cars Are Coming" they show the next future is cars for our society. It looks and seems like a bad and great idea. But we never really know until we take a full look into the research for this idea that they have for us. Google cofounder Sergey thinks this plan will work out. We'll end up seeing whether that is true or not.

As I see yes these cars are working by themselves and showing alot of positive things. But how can we insure for sure that it wont be that expensive we need more facts for that. The car will tell the driver when the driver has to move it by vibrating the drivers seat or some kind of signal. What if there are malfuctions to this process and it doesnt alert the driver. Yes the driver should already be alert just in case but we all have flaws that sometimes we space out.

It does seem like they are off to a good start with idea for "Driverless cars" but they need to have some facts,more percentages of how they know they wil be right that this will be a postive thing. I am still balanced out whether this is bad or good. im at a fifty-fifty with there idea. Maybe in a couple more years their plan will work but for now i just dont agree.
