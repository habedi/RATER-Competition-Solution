Do I agree that all kids in school should participate in some type of extracurricular activity or sport? Yes, Most kids go to school, talk to their friends, eat, laugh and some other normal middle school/high school kid things. But when they get home they usually sit around and play video games or just eat which isnt healthy physically or mentally. In order to become a striving student who wants to succeed you have to set a few goals first and know what you want. Having these extracurricular activities will help with that whether your doing it outside of school or not.

Kids dont know what they wanna do with their lives so setting goals for yourself is a great thing and there are many benefits to it. When you set a goal and you really want it, you must stay focused and work hard for it. You wont start off great at it so you have to set little goals and achieve them 1 by 1. Also, you have to stay positive and continue to do what you love.

The activities can help with very useful skills like communication skills, this is really important because its something you will always need for important events like job interviews, meetings and meeting new people. If you dont have good communication skills you will come of as quiet and maybe even weird but that all depends on the person your talking to. You also dont want to talk too much or than you'll be annoying. The more social you are the more friends you will make and you will have a good first impression on a lot of people. You should also be more open but dont get too comfortable too quickly, build your friendships and relationships over time, one of the worst things that can happen is when someone starts to take advantage of you and if they do you need to put them in their place.

If you have a skill that you are already good at, that doesnt mean your the best at it. The activities you sign up for may help you improve on the skills you need improving on and also try to pick an activity that best fits you so you arent playing chess when you hope to be a star basketball player. If you do end up trying something you dont know about or something you just picked because you didnt care or ran out of things you like, you may end up finding something that you are really good at or love. I would recommend trying something new to maybe find an undiscovered talent.
