Dear principal

It has been brought to my attention that you are changing the school policy to where you have to have at least a B average to participate in sports. I think that this is unfair it may be good in ways, but it also may be bad.

If some students didn't participate in sports then their grades may go down or go up. My personal opinion will be stated in the next few paragraph.

In my first paragraph is going to state why it is a bad idea.

In my second paragraph is going to state why it is a great idea.

My third paragraph is going to sate that it may affect our school.

Well I think it could be bad idea because some students may have good grades for the sports they play.

It may seem to them that it is unfair.

Me and a few of my friends have a C average and playing sports encouraged us to keep our grades up. If you could only play sports if you had a B average then maybe we wouldn't have enough people to play basketball or football. I know that if i couldn't play sports i would be heart broken.

It also may be a great idea because most people would try harder in school.

It could also encourage people to do their best to maintain a very good average in their classes.

it would let a lot of people be more focused on their school work instead of sports.

A reason it may affect our school in the population.

Most people would probably transfer to may other surrounding school because of it.

Or it may encourage more people to send their students here at SCHOOL_NAME.

This is my personal opinion on the issue.

I think it would be a bad ideal because most people here at SCHOOL_NAME maintain a C average.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
