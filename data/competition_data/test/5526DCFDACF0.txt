I think our principle should not let us bring our phones at all because if someone forgets to turn their phone off it would ring during class and everyone would get distracted. they could also use their phones to cheat. student could also be texting during class so i could also be a distraction to them in the learning process.

Students will eventually disobey this rule so i think the punishment for disobeying should be that the students have to give up their phone for one month and then can get it back. altho the problem with taking their phone away would be that if the parents of the student wanted to reach them they wouldn't be able to.

I think that at the beginning of the day students should put their phones into a big bucket and then after school get them so they can have them after school. if a student is texting during class then they most likely would not be listening and would not learn things. if they are texting they might not learn something and forget how to do it when they have homework..

My science teacher lets us use our phones in class when we have to use a calculator or something like a stop watch. otherwise she says no cell phones. Phones are a distraction to everyone in class because if it rings then your phone will distract the whole class.
