Some people thought robots would take over the world someday.

This might be the start.

A new technology, Facial Action Coding System, allows a computer to read a humans emotions bassed on their facial expression.

The inventor thinks that this technology should be used in schools.

It would not valuable to have technology be able to read emotions of students in the classroom.

It would be helpful for students when they are confused, but that's the teachers job.

Teachers are there to help the students learn.

In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author quotes "Then it could modify it's lesson, like an effective human instructor".

This quote shows that with the new technology, teachers won't be needed.

Why would we need the computer to change the lesson when students can just ask for help from the teacher.

This technology should be used somewhere else more effective like at an airport.

In an airport, the video camera could see if the people are confused and then the computer could tell an employer to go help them.

That would much more valuable and then robots still won't have the power to put people out of jobs.

To have technology be able to read students emotions in a classroom would not be valuable.

There is already someone who helps students in the classroom so schools don't need another.

This technology could be used somewhere else where it would be more efficent.

Robots/computers should always be helped by humans, not humans getting help from robots.
