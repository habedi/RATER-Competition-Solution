Dear Principal,

I believe that you should not make us do community service. Yes, it is a good thing to do and will make you feel better about yourself, but if you make us do it then we really aren't wanting to do it ourselves. If you make everyone do it then the ones who already were, won't get the recognition that they deserve. They feel good doing it without being told to because of the fact that it's something they want to do. They feel good about it because they are the only ones doing it and that makes them an individual. If everyone has to do community service, it just becomes something that people are doing just because they have to, not because they want to and that's what they should really feel while doing it.

If nobody really wants to do community service then why would you make them. It's something that is supposed to be done by choice not by demand. It would be like telling someone that they have to go shopping when they don't want to. Getting told to do something that you like to do when you aren't told takes the fun out of it. If you tell them that they have to do something they are more than likely to ignore you and to protest.

Volunteering is a good thing to do but only if you are doing a good job at it. If you have to tell someone that they have to volunteer then they are just going to slack off and do the minimum that they have to just to get their hours done. As good as volunteering is, it's only something a certain type of person can do. If the person is patient, calm and caring, then they should do a great job at volunteering. However, if the person is rowdy, rude and selfish, then they aren't going to do anything to help the community.

Community service is something that needs to be done, but not by demand. Demanding something gets the person determined to do anything except what's being asked. While some people might actually take this demand as an excuse to really volunteer, others are using it as an excuse to goof off with their friends. Volunteering at a homeless shelter is a lot different then volunteering at a retirement home. A homeless shelter doesn't take patience or calmness, it only take a nice heart. A retirement home does take calmness, patience, and also a nice heart. People sometimes volunteer at the wrong places. People without any patience could volunteer at a retirement home and end up doing more wrong then good. People without any respect could volunteer at a homeless shelter and start making fun of them, and make rude comments.

Over all, making us do community service would be a bad decision because people wouldn't take it seriously and could end up doing more wrong then good. They will protest and ignore your demands. The people already doing community service will feel like they weren't getting any recognition doing what they have been doing. You should really pay more attention to the people who are doing the good things, then realizing that other people aren't. If they choose to volunteer, so be it. At least they will have a good application when going to colleges. They will be the people who get in for honestly helping people. The others who didn't do community service will have a not as good application to college and it will be their fault for not doing good when they could have. It's our choice whether or not we want to help people. Some of us will be the good guys, and some will be the bad guys. Either way, it's up to us to determine our future with what we do now. Not yours, not out parents, but us.

I think it would be a bad decision to make us do community service.
