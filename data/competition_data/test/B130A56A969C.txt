Driving while texting is very dangerous for people on the roads. Millions of people have died from car accidents and texting while driving. I don't have driver license yet but I will be safe on the road when I get them . I have been in car accidents because other people were not paying attention and hit our car . I am glad they created the Hands-Free law to keep us safe .

The Hands-Free law was created to keep people from communicating while behind the wheel . If you have something to tell someone it can wait until you pull over . Car accidents happens everyday on the interstate because people are not aware of their surroundings . I would agree with people using their phone behind the wheel only for emergencies. Most people are not good with multitasking and driving .

I have drove while on my phone only to run an errand. I was bored so I called my friend to figure out other plans . I was safe while using my phone nothing happened. Although, that doesn't make chances short it won't happen next time . I will be more careful next time to decision or drunk drivers to .
