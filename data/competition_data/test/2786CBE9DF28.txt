Many people are wondering why more researchers are concerned about rising carbon emissions around the globe. Carbon emissions are gases that are released into the atmosphere by transportation and other types of industrial manufacturing. Lately, there has been a change evolving in different areas as supported by each source, that is moving toward "[car- free cities]". However, most citizens are also wondering what are the advantages of limiting their car usage, and how will it effect the life around their community; There have been ways of doing this as stated in these sources.

In source 1:

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it explains how in "Vauban, Germany, the residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few... [people] have gone before: they have given up their cars" (paragraph 1).

The statistics show that "[a]s a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"[:] to limit car usage. As it seems economically and environmentally effiecient, people such as Heidrum Walter feel "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (paragraph 3). The people in this area have noticed that " all of [their] development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change, said by David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States..." (paragraph 7).

Paris bans driving due to smog , by Robert Duffer, states that "after days of near- record pollution, Paris [had] enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" (paragraph 10). People were "ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22- euro fine ($31), (paragraph 11), and "[a]lmost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters- an international news agency headquartered in London" (paragraph 12). Most believed that it was a rivalry between Paris, France and "Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world" (paragraph 14).

Because of the tremendous fog, "[d]elivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug- in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying [several] passengers. Also, [p]ublic transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC (paragrpah 18).

Car- free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , by Andrew Selsky, states that in Bogota, Colombia "a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombials hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car- free day..." (paragraph 20).

They participated in this special occasion consecutively for three years, banning cars, but allowing taxi cabs, and buses for the "Day Without Cars" in the captial city; This promoted other transportation methods, while reducing smog output. Any people who violated this day were issued " $25 fines" (paragraph 21). Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said, "[i]t's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, as he rode a two- seat bicycle with his wife" (paragraph 24). "[This] day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid- 1990s" (paragraph 27). "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city..." (paragraph 28).

The End of Car Culture , (another article) by Elisabeth Rosenthal, provides more information towards this evolving movement nationwide. Not only is change occuring in the previous countries described, but the United States has started to be part of the change. "... [G]oals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions..., will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior..." (paragraph 29).

Numerous researchers are contemplating "a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?" (paragraph 30). Over the years the United States of America has gained notoriety for "its broad expanses and suburban ideals, [which has] long been one of the world's prime car cultures. Over the years, there has been an assembly line in Detroit, Michigan during the '40s- '60s and the "Model T" gave Americans the way to take a spin in "Mustang Sally" during the "Midnight Hour", while listening to Wilson Pickett (paragraph 31).

Overall, most countries including America, have seen changes in their economy. [T]he number of miles driven in 2005 dropped..." and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway, [b]ut by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way" (paragraph 32). Rosenthal states that there was a recession, and that the unemployed weren't working, but regardless, the people that were working still couldn't dodge the recession, which ultimately impacted not only the Automotive Industry, but everything else. Car companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranded their businesses (around the world, as it is Ford is an American car and Mercedes is a German car) (paragraph 32).

"Many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants" (paragraph 34). One thing that most of these people can agree on is that [d]ifferent things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long- term cultural shift..." (paragraph 35). All of this information can help lead citizens to new cures for shifting this change on the right universal pathway to preserving the atmosphere, ridding us of Global Warming and Greenhouse gas effects.
