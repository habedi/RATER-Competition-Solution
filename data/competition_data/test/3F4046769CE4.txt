Have you ever studied about Venus? Well, its very fascinating, and its our "twin" planet, because its about the same size and shape as Earth. It also has landmass like mountains, valleys, and craters. Even though we haven't research much of Venus, scientists believe that their could of been life on Venus, because they used to have a ocean just like Earth does.

Why machines fail to last years on Venus. Scientist and researchers have sent many aircrafts to Venus, but when they land, they only last fow a few hours due to the planet being 97% carbon dioxide, also being 800 degrees fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we expericene on Earth. With these extreme weather condition, it would melt, or crush the machine that we send to Venus, the land on Venus, is also made from acid, and not very solid. There are also very powerful earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and frequent lighting strikes. Venus is also the second planet from the Sun, so that also increaes the temperature.

What scientists are trying to do to change their aircrafts to last longer on Venus. Researchers are going back to old time mechanical computers, because with modern day compters, they can't resist acid and extreme heat, because they are delicate. Whereas the mechanical computers they can be more resistant to heat and acid. They where also trying to see if they could fly a spaceshuttle around Venus and collect data, but they knew tht it wouldn't work, because they would be to far away to see the land and whats happening. Also its foggy around the outer part of Venus.

So, If you ever want to visit Venus, then you might want to help NASA get their techn ology to work in extreme conditions, because if they don't find a way for machines to last longer on Venus, they are not going to be able to research the land, and collect rocks from it. Also they won't be able to find out if their is any form of life on Venus that is living.
