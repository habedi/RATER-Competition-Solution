Everyone should be able to choose for them self's. To help or to help. my out take on this yes we should help more but then again not all people have the same ideas and views on the world or the fact that they have to waste time helping some one who really needs it. I do it time to time out there an its fun. Hard but fun. If i could go back in time to summer where i first got my job at the library i would still do. I met alot of nice people and did alot of good things while i worked there an i was thinking bout working there again in this coming up summer. I wish it to be the same.

You also have to know that most people like things done for them i do at least. And not everyone is going to go out there help out. Even if u force them to. to help good help is to have people that really want to help. I say just form them to try it an see how it goings an if they like they like it but don't force them to. I would say make them do one to two hours of it. Then see how it goes and then take it from there. Everyone is different so don't think its going to work out because you might get some one that really wants to help an you might get some one that dose not want to have any to do with it. I wish more people help out more but u can't really help it. I want to see people helping time to time and when i see them help it makes me feel good that this green world is still in work mood.

I can't say I've done alot of work but i can say I've at least tried to help. This one time i help out a shelter for animals. It was sad but i felt good knowing that i helped. I would like a dog but my presents say I'm not old enough to take care of it because m not always around the house so i guess their right. I'm runny out of time so i guess what I'm trying sure why not go for it.
