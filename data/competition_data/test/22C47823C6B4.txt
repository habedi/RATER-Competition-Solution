Dear principal,

I think that you should allow phones at school as long as they are off during class. That way, we wouldn't have to keep our phones in our school bags all day. We would be able to carry them around in school. There could be some pros to this, and some cons to this. Some pros could be this: if something went wrong at school, or someone got hurt, we would be able to call our parents and tell them what happened. Or say we forgot something at home, we would be able to text our parents to ask them if they would be able to bring us what we have forgotten. In that way, cell phones would be a very useful thing to have.

Some cons could be that some students might not listen to these rules and have them on during class. Or besides just having them on, they may text people or play games on their phones. Students could also use cell phones as a way to cheat on tests. They could text each other the answers. Teachers would just have to trust us that we wouldn't cheat on something. Or that we would have our phones off during class time. I guess there really is no way to tell if we have our phones off during class time. If a student is caught doing something with a cell phone during class time, the cell phone should be confiscated until the end of the school day when the student can come and pick up his/her cell phone. If they continue to use their cell phone during class time, they should get a detention for violating school policy, or something along those lines.

I think that cell phone restrictions in school should be let up just a little so we would be at least able to play a game at lunch, or ask a friend a question in a free period. It would be nice for us students if the school would kindly let us. I think all of the students at the school would very much appreciate it. We would all be very great full if you followed through with this policy. All of the students I'm sure would obey the rules and be happy that we would be able to use our cell phones during lunch periods, or free periods. Thank you very much for taking the time out the read my letter. I hope that you have taken in to consideration what I have said.
