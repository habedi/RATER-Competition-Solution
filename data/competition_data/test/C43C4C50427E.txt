Imagine being on a vacation in the Bahama's and realize that you have to finish two book reports by the end of the trip. Now your vacation is totally ruined! You now are going to have to postpone relaxing and having fun, because you have to do school work before classes even start. The majority of schools around the country include summer learning assignments; which purposes as a way to help students get ready for their upcoming classes. This could included a genre of ideas of work to be assign that teachers could choose from. Most student's don't enjoy these projects; since, most kids don't want to start thinking about school until, the doors are open again. They would usually prepare you at a younger age with summer reading to help the gradual adjustment to essays, projects, and many more, easier to do. The issue is that, more and more students forget or never finish, these summer homework assignments, due to the lack of enjoyment or increased procrastination. So if you could choose your own project, would it be more likely that you would complete it?

If students could create their own homework assignments, what would it look like? A student could choose topics such as, sports, television, friends, family, location, or anything else that they could think of. Maybe if teachers assigned essays over break, students could choose what to write about. For instance, maybe they would like to explain what they did during summer or, describe their favorite sport, food, TV show, and even create a bibliography about themselves. I know that many students still wouldn't enjoy writing or reading over their summer vacation; but, what if a student could choose to do anything they wanted, instead of writing. They could make a picture collage, poster, PowerPoint, painting, or whatever they'd want, to show how their vacation is going or why they like a particular topic. If your school let you pick what to work on during break, what would you choose?

Why do students prefer not to do these assignments in the first place? What are teachers asking kids to do that's so uninteresting? Since you started enrolling in school, your teachers would choose to give you work during summer break. This was to help kids be more comfortable before starting the following school year. It usually starts with summer reading to help lead up to research projects or essays. If you're about to start entering AP classes, you're more likely to have more difficult assignments. If you're not taking an honor or AP class, it's less likely you're going to be given summer projects. Kids could tend do be less interested due to amount or difficulty they're given. What's the hardest assignment your teachers given you?

The real question is, how could we persuade school districts to allow these types of learning assignments? My school's county has social media accounts such as,

Instagram and twitter , that will inform parents, faculty, staff, and students, important messages about our community. If your school has a social media account, try to contact them or research your suggestion so you could to see if your idea could even be possible. Getting a message back from a schools social media account, can be harder then finding the answers you were looking for online. You could always ask a teacher, guidance councilor, or anyone at your school, to help you with any of your issues, including learning suggestions. If I was in this position, I would tweet at my county's twitter or direct message them, to try to get the answers I'm looking for.

At last it's 2020, and our goal on easier summer projects, hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. We have self driving cars and miniature robots to plan, remind, and clean for ourselves; but, we can't make school work more comfortable for summer. If we want to show our country that there's an easier way to prepare ourselves for school, we need to create an impressive thought out plan. We can figure out our main idea and focusing points, to later show our school counties all over the country, how important this subject is. Students just want a more relaxing and entertaining way to learn over their summer vacation, so why aren't we doing it?
