May i just say that i love the way our we vote and how the Electoral College chooses our prseident and vice president for us. I know that we aren't actually voting for the president our electors of our states do that. They may consider our votes but in the end they decide who our state chooses for president. The canidates have to have a majority of 270 electoral votes to win the right to be president. In reality, the people should be the ones to vote for the president not the Electoral College. We should be able to decide who we want to be the president of the United States to be.

"The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president."(source 1 paragraph 2, the office of the federal register). See we don't actually chose our president even though we should be able too. We are the people of the United States and it's a free country, we shouldn't rely on the electors for our state to chose who the president will be. We shouldn't have to worry if the Electoral College will chose the right person for our country. We should be able to make the right decision and not rely on other people to make the choice for us.

Abolishing the Electoral College is a good thing because we Americans dont deserve to come second. "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."(source 2  paragraph 10, Bradford Plumer).The electoral college could make a mistake and choose the wrong person to be our president but we Americans know whats 's best for our country, but sometimes we don't always get what we want. We don't decide who the president and that is wrong, but sometimes we have to deal with things we don't like.

Many people will argue with my decision of abolishing the Electoral College. "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a tran-regional appeal."( source 3 paragraph 19, Richard A. Posner). Apparently the Electoral College restores weight back in to the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.

Yes there may be very  good arguements about keeping the Electoral College but we should be able to vote for our president. We should have someone we dont even know vote for our president, we love our country and we want what's best for it. What is best for our country is allowing the people vote for the president not the Electoral College.
