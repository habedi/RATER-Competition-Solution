The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Do we really need that to identify our emotions, feelings or making us smile?

In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author describes how a new technology identifies peoples emotions. We don't need the technology to read our emotional expression. "Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions." We all try to hide our emotions, but there are people that could help us. Like friends or family they might make you smile when you're feeling down.

Everyone has feelings and we sometimes express it to people we get along. The Facial Action Coding Sysytem is not going to make us smile everyday, we all go through something in life. "For example, it you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." People are not going to express their feelings on every ad that tells you how you feel. These technology of calculating your emotions are not going to be helpful.

It's frusterating when a lot of people tell you to smile and that it looks pretty on you, when you don't want to smile. They don't know what we are going through in life. "In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners or your mouth. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle." Everyone fakes a smile somtimes for any reasons.

In conclusion, the technology that calculates your emotions are not going to work. Maybe Mona Lisa had so many emotions that poeple used that technology to fake her facial expression. There are people that can't even smile from all the pain they have in mind. So why do we need a technology to tell us our emotions when we know how we feel?
