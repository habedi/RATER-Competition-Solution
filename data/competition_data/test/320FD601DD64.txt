In my opion in how i fell about the Facial action cording system enables in how the computers can help identify how people fell in tell the human emotions is i blive its some how can be real in some how not be real. for eaxample in the storey it shares in tells us how people use it in it worked on them i have also seen it done on most tv shows so that is why i think that this could or may work ought. I also think in blive that it can also be not real a wil for example i have not use it befor or on other peoople .Also it still queston me on how a computer thinks that it could some how read a person emotions. Also using this type of work on students in kids can also be not much of a good thing if you think about because yes some people do get sad in really upset but not everone knows why they are mad or why they fell mad in somtimes people can fell sad with ought eving knowing that they are sad or unhappy. We aslo have people who dont want people to know there sad which is why most people had there sadness with happyness to show that there not sad because they dont want others to know how they reallt fell inside as will .So in my own words to me it could mean a god thing but aso mean a bad thing as will to.
