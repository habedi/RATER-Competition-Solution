Dear principal,

I think that you shouldn't make it a mandatory thing. If kids wanted to volunteer they would. I think everyone should do something to help the community, but making someone do something they really don't care about will just make them mad and or dislike you. I know not everyone will like what you do and roles would be roles. But still. Maybe if we had a bunch of fun volunteering projects kids could do through school it would make it easier for them to see volunteering doesn't have to be just like picking up trash (which is a good thing but honestly no fun) you could go to a pet shelter and play with the animals. Or I always that it would be fun to train service dogs for the blind or something like that. Or go to a soup kitchen and feed the homeless, that's what I do. I don't know, I don't think the principal would change his mind about roles for the school by one latter from a student but it's just my opinion on community projects. Thanks for reading my letter!
