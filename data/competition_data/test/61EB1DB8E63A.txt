The debate on the pros and cons of car usage has been an ongoing one. Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.

To begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."(source 2). This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.

In addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. "rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic;"(source 3).

Furthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," (source 1) says a citizen of a "car-free" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier. Therefore, reducing car usage will benefit our people's lives.

Hence, limiting car usage will create a better enviroment for people all around the world.
