Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students should have the right to use their phones during their free time. It isn't like they are using it during class, it is not distracting them from learning anything important. Also instead of having an extra phone for students in the office, you could get rid of it which could save you some money. Instead of students asking their teachers during class or during their free time, the student could pull out their phones during lunch or healthy living and call. Every day there are at least 10 students that need to call their parents or a family member for something they forgot and a lot of them decide to pull out their phones during class. This most of the time leads to phones getting taken away and upset students, or they are doing it without their teac. Or a student wants to text a friend at a different school, or in a different class. With the new rule of allowing phones these students will have less of an urge to text during class. As the principal you may still be thinking about trusting your students to stop texting at the wrong times. You could just have the students put all of their phones at the top of their desk, off, so if one lights up or one is missing you know they are still texting. If you take what I have said into consideration, i am sure it will work out. As a student, I know what goes on and what rules the students would follow.

This becoming a rule would make it everyone's top priority to keep this privilege and not get it taken away.
