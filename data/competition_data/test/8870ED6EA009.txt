Extracurricular activities are very important to not only your success at school but also your success in life. Not only does being in a club or sport help you grow, it also affects how colleges and bosses see you as a person. Participating in extracurricular activities can open many doors such as, acquiring new skills, becoming a more well rounded person, and meeting new people which can also lead to new opportunities.

In life your going to meet many people, some will stick with you and some won't, but you will learn something from each and everyone of them. Extracurricular activities will lead you to meet all of the different people in your school that may share some of the same interest as you. For example maybe a student decides to join the lacrosse team and none of your friends do. The student ends up meeting lots of people who also like trucks and fishing and hunting. If the student would not have participated an extracurricular activity, they would have never met their new friends. Another way doing clubs and sports will help you is the teachers or coaches getting to know you. For instance say an eight grader joins the art club, the art teacher never really knew you before. But, since you have been going to the club the whole year, the art teacher loves your attitude and thinks you are very talented . Then you are picking you classes for high school and you want to do a photography class, but you need you are teachers recommendation. The student that was in the club is more likely to get a recommendation than the kid who just took art. Meeting new people who also may give you new opportunities is a essential and will help throughout life.

Accumulating a new skill happens almost everyday to everybody. A skill can range from a way to write a story to a new way to shoot a basketball. In life you obtain so many skills and being in different clubs or activities can help you share them among many people. For example, a student joins the yearbook club. The student has never really been very good with computers, but is really good with cameras. Many of the students who are in that club are great at editing, but dont have great camera skills. With both of the student skills put together they work perfectly, but also the can teach the skills to one another. Another skill that is acquired through any club or sport you decide to do is, how to interact with others. There are many shy people but also many loud people. A shy person can view a very actively talking person and find new skill and maybe they wont be as shy because they know how to start a conversation and since they are in a extracurricular activities with people that share the same interest as them, they will be able to talk about club related subjects. Lastly, someone can learn how to play a sport. A large number of people play a sport, but usually not every sport. So, a student could give a different sport you don't play a shot. Maybe there is a student that runs track, swims, plays soccer and field hockey. But, they decide to play volleyball. Since they are required to do a club or sport they made this decision, but if they were not required to they most likely would have not tried anything new. Once they started playing the learned many skills and ended up being one of the best on the team. Making extracurricular activities mandatory could be beneficial to a lot of students and might even help hem find their true talent.

A well-rounded human being can have different definitions, but usually it means someone who can balance. Not the kind of balance of standing or walking across a tightrope, but more like having loads of work to do and getting it done quickly and quietly. It also means to be someone who helps others, which can range from friends to your whole community. At some schools there is Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps. Both Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps help the community and are extracurricular activities. These two clubs usually have people that are caring and want to help others in it, but they also have good grades and manage to do other activities. Another way student are well rounded is when they have multiple friends. While they usually have a few close friends they are also friendly and easily can make friends with anyone who sits with them. With extracurricular activities they could make even more friends or just be nice to someone new. They could also share their actions with new people who might decide to be more like the well rounded student. Finally, they can be friends with the teachers. To build a relationship with the teacher you can join a club that is run by a teacher. It is hard to talk to teachers during class and get to know them. But, once it is the club time and they can talk to a student with fewer people and where the don't have to teach, the student can actually get to know the teacher. This can be helpful in many way, they can understand your way of learning and be able to help you better and like what was mentioned before they can help with a recommendation for school or even maybe a job. Without extracurricular activities people wouldnt be able to be as well rounded as they could potentially be because they wouldn't be able to connect with others.

Extracurricular activities could help so many people in all kinds of ways. While their could be some problems with depletion of time, obtaining the skill or even the amount of school work they have to do after. There is ways around those kind of problems and they could easily be fixed. Joining clubs and sports teams can be very beneficial to everyone involved and learning new skills, meeting new people and becoming a well rounded person is just a few reasons to make extracurricular activities mandatory.
