Cellphones

People should not use their phones while driving because it is a huge safety hazard with many deadly consequences. Another reason, it puts the people that don't have car insurance at risk as well. People in America fall to realize the amount of damage they do when doing something so dangerous to ourselves and to other people. People who don't care about their own lives would do an action like this.

It's basically a safety hazard when it comes don't to situations like this. For example in 2019 there were over 55,000 accidents over the country every day and it's because a person is on his or her phone. Events like this puts people in America in panic, especially new drivers. Also another fact actions like this as increases the death rate in America which makes the country look bad. Then it also uses a lot of our resources to repair the damage to the car or for the factory to make more cars.

Car accidents are expensive to not just the people but also to their car insurance. Being in a car accident can affect your money which isn't a good if you're the type of person that having a hard time in life. People don't think about the consequences just by texting and driving. That person that caused the accident just by taking his eyes off the road could take a life or ruin someone's life. I believe that people don't need phones while their driving unless it's being used for good reason, like for example the GPS. Anything else shouldn't be allowed to protect the people and keep our taxes from going up because of these rates.
