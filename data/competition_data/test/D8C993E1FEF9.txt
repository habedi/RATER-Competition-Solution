Seagoing Cowboys, a great program. It is quit an adviture. You should go take a look for your self. See all the cool trips we take. See all the fun advitures we go on. How we meet new people. Come along and you will see.

The Seagoing Cowboys is a fun a way to learn about Eroup and about the end of World War II. On the trips you take you see amazing things. When I went I had the chance to see Europe and China. As you go on this trip it does not just teach you about that country it also teaches you about hard work. You can also find a way to have a good time and meet new people. On thins ttrip you will find it is a good way to learn about how people had to live and how it was hard in 1945 for many people to live and have food, as compared to now when everyone is walking around with a iphone 6 and drinking starbucks with lots of food and money. It will show you that you have to work hard for what you want. That back then nothing was handed to you on a silver plater. If you go on the trip Seagoing Cowboys you will find that it may take a lot of hard work but it can also be fun. Mostly when you are returing form trips and there are not animals on deck with you. Evryone playes Baseball and Volleyball games in the mptey stalls where the amimals sleep and stay on the trips.

What I think is that everyone should get this cool opertunity to be able to go and have fun and see what life was like back in 1945. It would be a fun and cool trip to see what you had to do and how you had to work. If you take my advice you sould go on this trip and go live in 1945 for a little ad have some fun, meet new people, and see some new places.
