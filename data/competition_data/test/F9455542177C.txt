I do not agree with this technolgy to read students expressions because its like forcing them to show their real emotion when they don't want to talk about or even show if they're sad or happy. Some student's come to school to help use get through with our emotion's through friends that they trust so if you bring that machine to a classroom and point out the person that is sad is clearly none of your busniess unless they wanna talk to you about it. This example "these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful" how can you tell if someone is being truthful through emotions? We all express our emotions differently, so differently that computers can't tell the difference. I think that the technology is useless and they should use their time to cure sicknesses or to help people besides telling their emotions through a computer. Instead of using their knowledge to make a computer telling the difference between emotion's they should put it into a good use like a cure to all sickness. I'm not calling them dumb or anything like that i'm just saying instead of investing their time and money on a computer they should invest their time to actually helping people.
