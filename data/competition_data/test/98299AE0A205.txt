After reading "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the authors idea that study Venus is a worthy pursuit, did not meet all criterias. The author provided many facts about the planet Venus, but didnt give a clear explaination on why we should pursuit the study of Venus. In paragraph 8, the author's reason to pursuit the study of Venus was that "our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation," the author has a valid point on that we should try to go beyond our limites, but he also relies on the fact of human curiosity and the gained insight of the planet itself. He does not take into concideration that we have attempted to explore Venus, but failed because the tempeter is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and has a pressure that is over 90 times greater then we have experienced.

In paragraph 2 and 3, it shows that we know the risks of trying to travel to Venus, with many attempts that have failed, and with the information about the planets thick atmosphere, that is almost 97 perent carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfurice acid, one small mistake could cause the whole mission to fail. With the information we have now, we know that the planet Venus is curently changing and getting hotter, it includes that "not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." In paragraph 5 and 6, it provides us with the information that even if we are able to travel to Venus, we would have to stay close to the sea level on Earth keeping us at a safe air pressure, we would have to be 30 or more miles above and the temperatures would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

In conclusion the authors idea to travel to Venus does not lead anywhere, his claim is not well supported and is made up of him own curiosity and he does not give a vaild reason. Travling to Venus is not a worthy pursuit that we should do, without our imagination and innovation met, we are forced to work harder to achieve our goals and to do more.
