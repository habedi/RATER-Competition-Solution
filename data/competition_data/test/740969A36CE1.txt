Phones and Driving

Is your phone or life more important? This is a frequently asked question for people that are so consumed by their phones while driving. As much as technology is a great essential to everyday life it is a huge threat to our lives especially while driving. People will always say "It's fine I won't crash!" Then boom one reply to a text that could've been sent when you have reached somewhere safe has taken your life. I want to speak on the importance of not texting while driving or just being on your phone at all, because it can save the lives of many.

I believe that people should not be able to operate a phone at all while driving a vehicle, because not only are you putting your life in danger, you're putting someone else's life in danger as well. "Reported by the National Safety Council that cell phone use while driving causes 1.6 million crashes each year." In society people will point the finger to teenagers, but what the world must understand is that everyone plays a big role in this destruction.

Law enforcement officials have tried to crack down on the problem of texting and driving or just occupying a phone in general. This is very hard because they're people out there that use their phones to navigate where they're going but this could also be a distraction. Also, a police officer can't catch every person that they see using a phone while driving and it's not legal to just suspect and pull someone and ask them for their phone. So, in that case there is not much law enforcement officials can do. I believe that law officials should give people warnings and if a car accident is caused by someone not paying attention to the road they should be arrested, because they're putting someone else's life in danger as much as their own. Driving classes that prepare you to take on the road should talk about this subject more and show the numbers of people being killed from accidents caused by phones. If we really want this problem to stop, we as people need to spread awareness on this topic!
