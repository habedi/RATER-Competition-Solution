Dear Principal,

I think that policy one is a better option because that way students can use their phone if they need to. Limiting cell phone use to their lunch period and free time is a wise choice because then their is no way they can get distracted in school with the feeling of wanting to check their phone all the time because they will have the option to do so.

At my school we don't have the option to use our phones. We can bring them to school but the rule is that they have to be off and in our lockers the whole day. Now what really happens is that kids will keep their phones in their pocket and whenever they feel bored in class they will pull them out and start using them. I see all kinds of texting in my class that teachers don't know about because kids know how to hide them. If you give them the option to use their phones at appropriate times I think it will limit texting in class.

Another reason you should allow kids to use their phone during free time and lunch is because in class the teacher may ask a question but never get around to answering it. The kid can then use his or her phone to google the question and come up with an answer. I know in my classes the teacher can be talking and ask a question but never get around to answering it. It bugs me so bad! But since we aren't allowed to use our phones in school we have to wait until we get home or on the bus. Well by that time most of us have already forgotten the question. So we never know the answer.

One final reason is suppose a kid gets sick. Most kids don't like to go to the nurse's office. I know I don't. So if the kid can wait until lunch or his free time he can then call his parents to come get him so he doesn't have to stay at school sick. At my school if you get sick and you don't want to go to the nurse you are stuck at school. No matter how bad you feel. You can ask the teachers if you can call your mom but they always ask why. If you tell them your sick they make you go to the nurse. If you go to the nurse unless you have a fever, no matter how bad you feel, they make you stay in school. But what are you going to learn if your sick? Nothing! You can also get other kids sick that way. So if you let your kids use their phones, school might be a little easier to handle.

You might want to consider letting them use their phones. It might end up helping your school! But of course the downside is what if they forget to turn off their phones? Well I guess you will still have to have some rule about taking their phones away. I hope these ideas will help you make a decision on allowing your kids to use cell phones in school.

Sincerely,

Student
