Apple, Samsung, LG, Google Pixel, etc. all these company's make and design smartphones. Most people in the world own smartphones. People use smartphones so much that it can become a distraction. A big distraction is while driving people start using their phones and put themselves and other drivers at risk. Texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in the world. Most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them. People need to have their phones on them all the time. When they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing. When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.

Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.

When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.

Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, " A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food." As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.

Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.
