Dear principal,

What i think the principal should do, allow students to bring there phones but they must be off and students can use there phones before school and after school. Students need it more after school in case they stay after school for a sport or tutoring. Students aren't supposed to take out there phones during school or during class. If a student takes it out during class the student won't concentrate on there school work. They will be on there phone more than on there school work. If its on and the teachers see it out they will take it away and your parents have to come and get it from the office. Right when the teacher takes it you can't get it back from them they will have to take it to the office. Students start getting there phones like in 6th or 7th grade. If its on and it ringers during class the teacher will say turn it off. Sometimes they will give you a warning and the second time they will take it away. Some students can't live without there phones because they always use it to text or call people. Some students don't turn off there phone they just put it on silence or vibrate. In some phones you can hear the vibrate across the room. Some students do get there phone taken away once in a while but not all the time. One of my friends kept on getting her phone taken away like every week from the same teacher and they give it up to the office and when my friend's mom came again to get the phone they told her mom, "Your daughter can't bring electronics to school because she always gets it taken away from the teachers." So now that she doesn't bring her phone to school she has to call her mom or her dad from the office or phone her friends phone after school.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
