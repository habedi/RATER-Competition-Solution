Dear TEACHER_NAME i would say that it is bad for our school to have only B averaged students because most of the good people at sports have C averaged grades and if we want to beat other teams across our district we need good people so that is why i think we need at least C averaged grades that way or teams would be good and we would have better than a grade C average grades also if we did have a good teams school that way people that want to go to collage just because they want to join the college teams they could get good practice between 7-12 grades so that by the time they are in collage they can be professional and can go up to be in the NFL,NHL,MLB,NBA,MLS and all of that good stuff! Also they can be rich and have a good life instead of like normal people now that its hard for them to pay there mortgage and to pay all of their bills such as cable internet electricity water heat and all of those bad things!
