Having projects over break is never fun but what if you could choose the project. Students should be able to choose a project because it will make them want to do it more and they can show there own interest.

If a student is doing something they chose to do, it will be done more efficiently and more students will be likely to actually complete it. Over break no one does anything because, it's break, they are trying to enjoy themselves. However, if the project is something fun and interactive they wont push it to the side, like if they have to write an essay. Grades will be better since the project is something the students actually want to do. This is why students should be able to choose the project.

School should connect you with your own personal pathways you want to take in life. Having students pick the projects can be the connection of school, to there own interest. This helps them acknowledge that things we learn in school, can and will be beneficial in the real world as well as the future. Grades, being the most important thing about high school, can be impacted negatively or positively by a break project. So, if the student is doing something they enjoy, the passion will make them do better, which makes their grades go up. Rather than doing something boring and generic that will cause there grade in there class to drop.

Teachers may say that this is a bad idea because some students wont take it seriously and pick a useless project not related to school. However, the simple solution to this is the students will be required to pick a topic related to the class and get it approved by the teacher.

In conclusion it is very beneficial for students to pick the project they want to do and will only affect them positively. Grades will always be extremely important and stressful for students, so why make it worse by assigning a project over break that no one likes. Having a project they chose will make them want to do the project more and they can also express themselves by showing their own interests.
