Hello. I am Luke Bomberger and after you read this article, you will definitely want to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It is a fun job, it is a job full of adventure, and is a very heartwarming experience.

I said that being a Seagoing cowboy is a heartwarming experience. And there is no doubt about that. While being a Seagoing Cowboy, you ride the seas. And you also tend to animals to keep them well for the trip to other countries. These animals will be given to countries in need from the World War 2. It can really give you a good heartwarminng feeling when you help others. But you don't just give to the countries, you also get to viset them! Besides helping people, you can tour all the different countries that you visit. I got to visit many places like the Panama Canal on my way to China. And I even got to tour and excavated castle in Crete!

As I said in the previous paragraph, you will be working and traveling the world. And even though it is a hard working job and long periods of time on a boat, don't fret! There are a lot of fun activities and games that you can participate in on the ships while you are traveling. And sometimes, you can even play sports! After we took the animals to their destinations, we all played baseball and volley ball games in the empty holds where the animals were previously held. There were differnt games also. There was table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and other games too! But sometimes, I would like to read a book or whittle something. So you will definitely have a fun trip.

So do you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy yet? I bet you do! In this article, I said how it is a heartwarming experience, it's a job full of adventure, and has very fun trips around the world! I know I definitely liked being a Seagoing Cowboy, and I bet that you will love being one too!
