Many schools require their students to complete summer projects, but are they given the freedom of making their own product? Some students would prefer to have their teacher assign them a certain project because they struggle to find something that interests them. However, most students prefer to come up with their own idea. Summer projects should be student-designed because it helps develop their work ethic, students can not copy off of other projects, and the final product will be more polished.

Allowing students to design their own type of project would make them more interested in it, and help develop their work ethic. Everyone is interested in different subjects, and not everyone thinks the same way. Giving students the freedom of working on a project in which they find interesting will greatly increase their work ethic. It is crucial that students are developing their minds all year round. When students return to school, they feel like it is their first day of school in their lives. Providing students with the option of working on a project which interests them will make them more prepared for the start of the shcool year. The best students have a great work ethic. They are able to do alot of work for a long time. The more interested a student is in their work, the more they will want to do it.

When teachers assign students work, it is very easy for them to copy ideas. Teachers will assign the same work to all their students, and the students will not do thier own work. When students copy off of other people, they are not gaining any skills, nor learning how to be independent. Allowing students to create their own projects will enhance their creativity, and encourage them to think outside the box. The purpose of school is help young kids find what interests them. No one wants to do something that does not interest them. Therefore, students will not do their own work. Students will do their own work if they are interested in the subject, and allowing them to create their own product is how to accomplish this..

Lastly, allowing students to design their own project will provide a better, more polished final product. It is very easy to create a project on something if the individual is familiar with the idea. The more interested someone is in a certain subject, the better the product will be. For example, it is difficult to write an essay on something that is unfamiliar, or not interesting. On the contrary, it is easy for an individual to write an essay on something that interestes them, or they know alot about. This idea can apply to almost anything, especially a school project. It is hard to find the drive to do schoolwork over summer, but it helps if students are allowed to choose their own assignment, and if students want to work on the project, their final product will be better.

Their are many benefits to allowing students to create their own projects. Their product will be better, they will do it themselves, and it helps develop their work ethic. Finding ways to encourage students to complete their summer work can be challenging, but giving them the freedom of doing something they find interesting is the best way to create an incentive. Their are some benifits to teacher-assigned work, but enabling students to think for themselves is more important.
