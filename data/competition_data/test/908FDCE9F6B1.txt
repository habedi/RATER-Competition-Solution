Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think policy1 would work butter because so many kids have cell phone any how and they us them when there not allowed to i don't have a cell phone but i think so many people would like that any how. kids that don't have cell phone could bring there i pods or some thing maybe. but if so many kids don't follow this i think it would be a good choices to try it if you don't then i think we can go with plan two. but it would be a fun thing for the kids that have cell phone and if they don't have a cell phone then they can bring some thing to do please let this work i think it would be fun for ever one that is going to flow the plane and if you don't flow it u will get in big trouble. and if you don't like it dwell over it i don't really care. about it it's not about one person it about the hole school and if you think this is s good idea go for it and try to lea son to what you are told so your school can have more chance for what they want and what there going to do with what you give then and if someone phone goes off when its not told to the teacher can take it away from you because you weren't fallowing instructions.
