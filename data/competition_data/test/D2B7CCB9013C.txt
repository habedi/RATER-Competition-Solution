Do you have something you are good at, like a hobby or a skill? Hobbies can range from musical theatre, to art, sports, cooking, and to gaming! Some people have several hobbies, while others focus on just one. Some people find their interests and hobbies easily, but others take time, and may need a little push from their parents or their school. Trying something new can be difficult, but with the new policy the principal established regarding participating in at least one extracurricular activity, it is a great opportunity to get started on and have fun with participating in something new.

The benefits of trying a new a hobby or extracurricular are numerous. One of the effects of this new policy is that students can easily find something that they can be focused on, interested in, and invested in. Through that certain activities, they may find that it is beneficial to their health, like sports, or beneficial to learning life skills, like cooking. Students also have the chance to gain social skills, and create new friendships and friend groups through extracurricular activities. Another effect of the mandatory extracurricular policy is that students may develop new appreciation for the school and the faculty who work there, as they discover that teachers can juggle teaching school subjects as well as organizing and managing clubs or other activities. Above all, students' overall mood and their mood towards school may shift, as they have found an aspect of school they enjoy. Their mood might also be changed because they look forward to their extracurricular, for they have the chance to participate in something interesting to them, something they are interested in learning, or something they are already good at. Students could also be excited to master the skill or subject, communicate and work with their friends, and make connections around the school whether with fellow students or faculty.

Parents may also find benefits of the new extracurricular policy. They may find that their child is more attentive and focused at school, and their report card and grades may be showing improvement because they have joined an after-school activity. This is because they have most likely formed a bond with a few of their teachers through extracurricular activities, and student may have more motivation to do better in those particular classes, plus they may find it easier to speak with their teachers and approach them for help. Parents may also notice that their child is less inactive, or perhaps less "lazy", because their extracurricular has motivated them to do a similar activity or an activity related to the club at home. Finally, parents will most likely be supportive of this policy because the club or activity will keep their child busy for a few extra hours after school, meaning that the parents may be able to work a few hours more because they don't have the responsibility of taking care of their child.

Teachers may also be able to profit off of this policy for a few different reasons. One of those reasons would be that teachers would gain more respect from students, and would be able to spend their time in class more efficiently, as students would most likely be respectful of them teaching, and would not waste class time being disruptive.

Although there are many benefits of the mandatory extracurricular activity policy, there may also be a few drawbacks. One drawback would be for students, in that they would have less time for homework, and completing projects and assignments teachers have assigned for them to do at home. Another drawback for students would be that they may already have commitments outside of school, such as dancing at a dance studio, or taking at classes at a craft store. A problem for parents might be that after school buses aren't available, and they have to pick up their child from their after school activity, which may be an issue for their schedule, or they are unable to pick their child up because of work. A drawback for faculty or teacher would be that the student may be almost too excited for their extracurricular, and they attempt to rush their assignments and classwork so then they are able to finish faster and go to their activity faster. Another possibility is that students wouldn't be focused in school, because they are thinking about their after-school club. One last drawback would be that students might not like the extracurricular activity policy, and would not want to have fun doing it, because they seem like it is forced and unfair because it is mandatory. However, all these issues have viable solutions. For example, as solution to the the issue regarding already having extracurricular activities out of school could be that there could be a opt-out form for people with out-of-school commitments that students and their parents would have to sign so the they could op-out of the extracurricular policy. One plausible solution to the transport problem for parents who work is the faculty of the school could advise students who live near the school to walk or bike home, that way there would be less kids needing the transport of a bus, and less demand for a bus would mean that the school could afford buses each day because of having less buses overall. The drawback regarding students having less time for homework and other assignments could be that there could be a club for homework where students could meet up and work together on homework with the assistance of teachers. Another solution to the following problem would be that teachers could help students use their time wisely during study hall to finish homework.

There are several different effects of the extracurricular activity rule, although most effects are positive, and all of the negative outcomes of the policy have solutions that the administrative council could easily adhere to. Overall, I would fully support this policy because it could be beneficial to the entire school community, students, parents, and faculty.
