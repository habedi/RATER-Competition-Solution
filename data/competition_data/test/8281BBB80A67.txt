Dear principal i believe that students should not be required to do community service because if they don't want to do it then they have the right not to do it but forcing them to do it could cause the students to revolt and they could cause a bigger mess then the students who said they would do it would get mad the ones who did it and they would blame it on the principal.

Then you would have to do fix what happened so then nobody wins in that case. So i think its better just to let the be the volunteers could help old people with crossing the road and feeding them there pudding. Then the people the don't help could be making the mess and the helper just clean them up so its a win win situation for everybody even for the principal because then he do have to fix anything and you can just not get involved with the non and helpers of your school. Community service sould depend on with the students believe is right and most students wont do it they could change schools or just not go to school da students to do it is a bad idea it could cause many problems in school even at home and if that happens parents could sue the school then a whole other story would happen so i believe that making students do community service is a bad idea.
