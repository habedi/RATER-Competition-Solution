I think people should join the program becuase it can be a life changing experience, in parargh 5

Luke says it opend a world to him, he also says that he is grateful for the opertunity that he has. Being in something can make you feel better about yourself because you would have a lot of oppertunitys like making new friends, or being something thast you can call yourself a team in. In the program you also get to have a lot of fun you can do a lot of thing insted of just doing one, people like to hang out and play sports and just hang out and have fun. You get to go on the most adventurous journeys. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy You get to do a lot of trips by yourself or with other people and it is just a good oppertunity that someone would have. Some cowboys even travle and go over seas. This program is something everybody should be in because you never know maybe along the way a good oppertunity comes along. The program can also give people courage, because if they are scared of maybe being with people they could learn to build up strenght. Not everyone will agree about joining the program and that fine, all that matters id that poeple who care will be joining. People can become something of themselves and they would aslo be proud for doing and accomplishing something. Being a cowboy can also make you be a good role modle and also many kids could look uo to you and also they could be one some day to all because they saw hiow it could change someones life. This is why i think this progra can help a lot of people, i have supported my claim and gave many reasons. So this is why many people should join the program.
