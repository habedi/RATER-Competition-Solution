Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that every student at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to do services in the community. If every student worked at least half of an hour a day in the community, Corona would be a cleaner and safer place. I enjoy community service because it makes me feel like I'm helping the community. Everyone should help out our community one way or another.

There are many ways that students could perform in the community. Some ways are; cleaning up trash in the park, volunteering at an animal shelter, or even donating items to those who need it most. I have much experience in volunteering because I used to be a Girl Scout. When I was in Girl Scouts, I helped clean up the beach, sorted items at Goodwill and much more.

Students in Leadership here at SCHOOL_NAME are required to volunteer in the community.

Many of my friends are in Leadership and enjoy performing in the community. If I had the chance to volunteer in the city of Corona, I would be honored to.

Students could even help in the areas they enjoy the most. I enjoy cooking, so I could volunteer at the soup kitchen serving food to families in need. Some other ways you could help are sports. Some people could teach students

I think that all students in every school in the city of Corona should volunteer somehow, someway. I'm grateful to live in the city of Corona, but there are always areas of improvement.

Thank you for your time and please consider community service for all students.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
