introduction

Working on school work from home can have an impact of your learning. Most people are sometimes better at being hands on learning or they learn from notes and more better ways. if somethings there trying to benifit from home some people do online school and you mite think they can cheat on there work and do sneaky things. For one reason i would say is that if your in a class you have a better chance at hearing the teacher and know what they are doing and if your online you would use videos and online documents.

body paragraph 1 if i was a student at my school and my school offer me to take a online class i would say no because i like to be hands on and take notes with the teachers and understand what's going on in the class room. Haveing a class online it my feel weird because you are alone and its is just youreslf with no help and i think that can have a negative effect on my if i was chosen to take a online class. Sometimes people tend to be angry because and do not have no help in the classroom and want to do things on there own and want to do things there own way.

body paragraph 2 students would not benefit from takeing classes from home and for me i think that because that person my not have ever taken a online class.

now since there onlinethey would have to learn a diffrent way of learning all becuase they are takeing a class online insted of takeing the regular class where you can be active with the teacher. One of my reason i say this is becuase they would have no help online and they would just cheat there way into a good grade and you are not getting anything from that and that would be a bad part of learning.

Teachers may use online resources for there students and that's is okay but people got to understand that the internet and messy and it can mess up alot of things in many types of ways in learning.

body paragraph 3

The class room have a big impact on learning and if you do not pay attention you would no be able to know the stuff that you are in class. Teachers try their best to use as my types of ways for you to learn in the class room online you may cheat and find all diffrent types of ways for you to pass but not learn anything. Students can benefit from cheating. if is waas in the position of a student and takeing an online class i would not be able to learn because i have no help and all and i would not understand that things i would be doing online. an online confrance can help if i do not get off track at anytime in the video and pay attention alot but it still would be hands on for me even if i can see and hear my teacher.

body paragraph 4 for all things in takeing an online class first people will need computer and some people do not have enough money for a computer or internet access at the home. well if you was at school you would just need to attend the class and leanring and get an education. if your takeing an online class and home a person just mite go in the kitchen and get a bunch of food and get off track from there work and will end up getting a bad grade on something. Just becuse it an online class doesn't mean that your can use the internet for all the anwser i serch up college teachers and some teachers said that the students they have online they will check every single person work.

counter argument people that use online classes as another way of leanring it is going to be a bad thing to be because you not in a regular class and your not learning the right wat you suppose to. if you take an conference video it mite can help people understand the concept of the work. The most extreme reason i will say is that most students wouldnt have the funds for a computer to take an online class. online and a reugular class will change everything and if i was in the position i would take a reugular class so i can be in the moment and learn better and get help from my teacher conclusuion in conclusion student cannot benefit from being able to take a class from home just because if may effect them and a very big way. Students may not have the right funds for it and some my get off topic and get away from the learning and get a bad grade on ther work online. in regular class you can be hands and and takes notes and learn and let the teachher guide you to succes all you have to do is pay attention and do your work. if a person have taken a online class it still wouldnt fit the right way then a reuglar school class.
