Dear Principal,

Policy 2 seems to me like the best idea. Policy 2 allows students to learn. Students do not yet know the value of their education so it would be wise to not allow phones at all.

Policy 1 doesn't sound like a good idea. If you allow students to have their phones at certain times in the day, then most students will just use their phone discreetly throughout the day. Some students might have a different lunch time than other students and will try to text someone that is in class. Well I can hear you trying to say that students will have their phones turned off, now how many students would actually do that?

Policy 2 keeps the phones away from most students. I'm sure you will have a couple students that don't follow this policy, but that is what discipline is for. Cell phones are a big problem at school. Students want to socialize more than they want to learn. Now cell phones are becoming an even bigger problem. This new revolution is called internet and gaming phones. Now students can get cellular devices that have games on them. What is more distracting than a nice, fun flash game in the middle of a seemingly never-ending, boring class?

The internet is another big problem because if students have their phones during a test then they can look up the answer to a question on the internet. Sure you can set up a WEP key for the WiFi, but kids can still get internet through 3G or 4G coverage. Some phones do not even need the internet to get answers to questions, they just have apps for it. This could turn into a giant problem because finals would no longer be about what you learned, but more about how fast you could look it up on your phone. You cant have that kind of cheating on SATs or other important tests.

I think a no phone policy would be ideal for the school. Not just because it would keep students from getting too distracted, but also because it would keep students from cheating on important tests. The look of the school to parents and government officials is key so you don't want students walking around texting all day. You have to keep up your test scores and phones would not help that. Overall Policy 2 sounds like the most solid and smartest plan.

Sincerely,

Your Student
