Why Drivers Should or Should Not Use Cell Phones While Driving

I strongly agree that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving a vehicle. One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. Second, you're putting your life at risk, and others that are in the vehicle with you. Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed.

One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. You can cause a wreck by being distracted by your cell phone due to looking down at it and not paying attention to the road. You can easily run a red light or a stop sign. When a wreck occurs the driver's negligence is liable for the accident victim's damages. Those are victims entitled to compensation for damages directly resulting from the collision. A crash typically happens in less than 5 seconds in the real world. Using your cell phone in one hand and driving with the other is another cause of a wreck. To prevent this from happening, drivers should use hands-free objects such as headphones, Bluetooth from car, and a car mount/windshield cell phone holder.

Second, you're putting your life at risk. You're putting you're life at risk because you could end up in a bad car accident. You might live; You might die. You never know. You are decreasing your awareness of the road leading to more car crashes. Texting and looking down at the phone distracts you twice as much as a phone call. This can cause various accidents and represent a danger to the physical integrity of the occupants of the car and also serious injuries.

Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed. Phone cause accidents. Someone could send you a message and you can take one little glance at it and you can have an accident right then and there. Social media distracts you as well, scrolling and looking down at your phone can cause a distraction and can also make you have a wreck. By the time you get down looking up from that device, you'll probably have already hit someone else's car. Phones are not more important than you losing your life. Put cell phones away and pay attention to the road. You don't want to end up injured or dead from something you can easily avoid while on the road. You'd rather be safe than sorry. They have multiple objects you can use for cell phones. You can use the cell phone holder. You stick it on your car's dashboard and it holds your cell phone so you can watch the road or maybe your car has Bluetooth in it and you can talk/text while driving at the same time.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving a vehicle. One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. Second, you're putting your life at risk, and others that are in the vehicle with you. Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed.
