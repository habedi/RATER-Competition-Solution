Dear Principal,

On your subject of deciding to make all the students do community service as a requirement I would like to give you my thoughts on what I would do if I were in your position. To me I don't think that it should be a requirement. For reasons soon to be explained! Although I do think that you should encourage community service often!

The reason I believe that you should not make it required is because of some student unwillingness. Usually I have found that when people are doing community service people find it rude when the person helping out is grouchy or doesn't think that they should have to be helping with it. This can sometimes make people unhappy with the service of the help and may not want it again which may cause people who actually want to do it be unable to help later on when they volunteer to.

This means that if you force the students who do not want to be helping out of the community on there free time it may cause them to do the things people wouldn't like. I personally know that I can end up being rude to people when I am forced to do something I wouldn't like. Now this leads me to my next point.

I believe that you should be encouraging the students to be helping out the community often. This will get students who will be willing to help out in a good manner to do it. That will cause the community to be happy with us children and it will benefit all of us.

I personally do not end up helping out all that much in our community, because often I do not find the jobs fun. There is one job I have always enjoyed though it is called Feed My Starving Children. Going to this place with my friends from my church was really a great time. I think that if we went to a field trip to a place like this that is a fun way to help out the community it may get kids excited to help out around town!

Here are some of the things you do at feed my starving children if you are considering this. The main goal is to pack up food to send to starving people around the world example Haiti. You have people take positions packing different foods required in a good diet in a certain order in a bag. You also have someone (has to be an adult) seal the bags shut with a little machine they have. Then they are packed into boxes that will be shipped to the different places. I warn you that this is a Christian organization but they will not make anyone who does not the follow the religion pray at the end with them or anything of that sort! I do think this would be a great idea.

I would like to thank you for reading this and taking your time on it. It means a great lot that you may consider my idea's. This is your choice though and I will take no disrespect if you do not agree with me. Thank you again please choose well (I am sure you will)!

Your Student,
