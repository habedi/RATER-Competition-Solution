We should allow students with C averages to participate in other activities. Studies show that students that do extra activities do better in school. Researchers have 3 reasons why kids should do extra activities. They are, one the kids feel welcomed and a part of something, two it keeps the students from doing other things that might get them into trouble and lastly it is a fun experience for kids.

i hope these reasons speak for themselves so to speak. All the kids with C averages are just hopping that you will not approve of such a cruel policy.

Don't you want to go somewhere where you feel safe and welcomed? I know many people would. It is the same for kids, they want to feel like they are a part of something and don't want to feel left out. They want to explore new things and feel good about it and if you but a restraint on that then you are causing a huge problems for us growing kids. We need to find what we are good at and what we want to do in life and if you but a halt on that because of a average then you are basically taking away our childhood. Which person wants to do that? Studies in the local newspaper show that kids grades 6 through 12 do 20 percent better if they participate in sports teams or clubs. Now wouldn't that look good on our test scores? I hope you look at this in a different view.

Many kids now a days are getting more and more involved in drugs and the street. Doesn't that scare you. Think about it, kids in grades as low as sixth are doing and selling drugs for money. Police say that if we can keep kids off the streets more often then there will be less and less drug dealing kids in the US.

Doesn't that make you feel good if you can crack down on drugs and kids. It is said that kids with bad lives and grades who can't do things turn to drugs as an escape plan. So if we cam stop this our kids will be better off. I hope you can see that we shouldn't limit kids because of their grades.

Every kid just wants to have fun and just hang out with friends right? So if we can help them do that then why not do it. If we can give kids a safe fun environment to hang out in then they will obviously do better in school. Every kid just want to be accepted and not be judged, so if we can help stop that then we should do it to the best of our ability. Enjoyment is the main reason for life so why take it away from our youth. Jefferson said we have 3 reasons for life Life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now who want to go against one of the Founding Fathers? I know not to many people want to tray that one. So lets not punish our kids for their grades by not putting them on sports teams. Do it for the kids please.

I have stated what i wanted to say and now it is up to you. As a principal do you want to be know as a struck up one or as a caring thoughtful. You pick. The fate of kids in your school lie in your hands now, but please choose carefully. Remember kids want to be accepted and welcome and have fun, but also want to be safe and stay off the streets. So do choose wisely for the kids sake.
