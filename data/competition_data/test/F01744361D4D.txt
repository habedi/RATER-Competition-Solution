Phones and Driving

Modern society and cell phones, its an unbreakable bond, like a child to its mother's hip. There's a big problem with people using smartphones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and its causing wrecks, finder binders, people on the sides of the road to get hit from oncoming traffic, and people walking into the middle of the road while texting. Society has become more and more stuck to their screens. On a daily basis i see people swerve in and out of my lane on the road. Even when riding with my own friends, i constantly tell them to get off their phones, never do they listen.

The people of the world have lost the respect for vehicles that they used to have. We have become accustomed to using technology at all points of our lives. Wrecks happen everyday because someone couldn't wait to see who texted them back. Texting and driving has become a serious issue, with phones getting more and more involved in our lives it is apparent that action needs to be taken. When driving a motor vehicle of any type, a cellphone, tablet, apple watch, or ipod should in no way be able to be used. It puts the public peoples and themselves at risk of death or serious injury.

A law just came out in georgia that is a no hands law, you can not even have your phone in your lap, in your shoulder, definitely not in your hand, and nowhere near your face when driving a vehicle. I believe this should go in effect everywhere, and have some serious reinforcement from the police of society. Without someone to make people think before they act. That song you just couldn't wait to change, or that text that you just had to send, or that snapchat that you had to watch could be the very last thing you do. For the safety of you, and everyone around you please take action.
