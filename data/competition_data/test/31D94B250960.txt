Imagine going home and doing nothing but work, work, and more work. Being cooped up in the house and the only thing you could do is homework for hours. I think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. They will have the chance to do something that makes them happy. Something that will let their brain take a break from working so hard during school.

Students will be able to make new friends and meet new people. Before I came to middle school I only knew the people from my elementary school and that was it. Until I joined chorus, I made friends with people that enjoyed music as much as I did. It was so much fun to be around new people and to make new friends. Even though we would have to stay after school to practice for up coming concerts it was still worth it. It gave me something to do after school and I could let my brain take a break from comprehending all the learning tactics that I have come across in school. I got the opportunity to do the one thing that makes me happy almost everyday. If students participate in an extracurricular activity it will give them a chance to open up to new people that may stay with them for a long time in their life.

Students will have something fun to do after school. They would get to enjoy something fun that they may want to continue in their future. It gives them a chance to relax and enjoy the things they love to do outside of school. It will be a more enjoyable experience when they are doing something that really makes them happy. One of my friends loves to play sports and it makes her really happy. She was not worried about homework or getting something done right when she got home. Instead she got the chance to let her mind rest from all the learning and power on the part of her brain that helps her enjoy the sport that she loved. Students will have a better time concentrating on there homework after they have had time to relax by doing extracurricular activities.

Students will have the opportunity to learn something new whether it is a new instrument or a new sport. Every day in school you learn new things in all subjects but it is all surrounded around test and quizzes. But when a student decides to take an extracurricular activity they can learn something that will make them much happier and that does not involve test or quizzes. When I was in fourth grade I decided to start playing the violin. I understood that it was a big responsibility taking on something outside of school but it was worth it. I have always loved playing the violin and I continue to play it now. Also I had to stay after school multiple times to practice with everyone in the orchestra. I learned how to make my brain stronger by doing something that was at a different level of difficulty in a different way.

In conclusion, I think that student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. Students might discover something new about themselves that they did not know before they decided to take and extracurricular activity. Students should not have to work so much and not have any time to themselves. Everyone needs time to relax and do the things they love. By relaxing they give their brain a break to recharge and get ready for all the work that will come in the future.
