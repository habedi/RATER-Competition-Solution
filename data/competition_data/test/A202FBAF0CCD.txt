Some students should be offered distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students that live to far from schools and don't have there transportation. Some students might be getting bullied at school and would be best for them to be home schooled and some students don't learn as fast as others, so it puts them behind.

Why should we all think about letting our children to be home schooled. As we all know some of us don't always live in the area, where we all close to the stores, hospitals and schools. Most of us have the transportation to get to places, but maybe not our children that attend the public schools. Public school do have transportation, but its not always available take all the students that attend the schools. As we said before some of us live far away from the city and the schools can not be able to get the buses that far. For that problem our students will be missing school, but if students home school, the students will benefit stay at home then not having any school at all.

Every school in this world will have some kind of bullying or harassment. To help the students at school, the schools can try to stop the bullying and the harassment. But still the schools not hundred present sure they can make it stop, because not every student will want to share or say something about who is bulling them and why. Students are afraid of what the bullies will try to do, they might hurt them more, because they snitched on the bullys, and that just lots of stress for the students, that might be getting bullied or harassed. For that reason student have hared time focusing in classes, have lot on there mine. The best thing for them is to be home schools because home schooling and doing work online gives them safe interment where they can work at there own speed and be safe at the same time.

Some students that attend schools don't always have the easiest time learning, and some of the times it might be that they are mentally disabled. For them reasons student should be able to attend the online classes, where they can take the classes at there own pace and they can just replay the videos of the teacher talk till they get it. When the students in class learning, the teacher don't always go to the speed where all the students can get caught up, and stay on track. Thats why students should be able to have the other options, like have the online classes or be home schooled.

There for all the students should have the different options, should they have to be at school and learn or be at home and do the same. Not all students have the transportation to get to school because of how fare they live. some students might have some bulling issues and harassment, and it would be the best for students to just leave the school, so they don't have to be focused on other people making fun of them or making the students feel bad. Some student have hared time learning in class because of the speed that the teacher is going or they just have mental disabilities and they just need to take the class in the slower passe, that would really benefit the students that need more helo then others. the inline programe will benefit lots of students all over the world.
