Would you like to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? You will have so much fun we do lots of things. After World War ll we go and help many animals and people. You will get to do many things in your free time. You will learn many things about our program.

Lets talk about what we do in our program,and where we go. How did we go and help the animals that were being shipped away on sea? Well the UNRRA had called us and told about them,and it seemed like they needed our help. As you know we help a lot of animals in our company. The animals deamnor change when we came in.

In our free time we play many games and we eat A LOT of food. Some of us act like monkeys in a good way. We talk about many thinks while were on sea OH

I almost forgot we help people too. It takes about Two weeks to go to some places it takes months too. Just remember its alawys worth it with animals and people. You will also get a free shirt and a enourmous tv. please don´t go just because of those things.
