Dear Principal,

I believe that you should let us use our cell phones during lunch and passing periods. One reason is that if you let us use them then we will eventually get tiered of using them in school and ultimately stop using them altogether. Also we as students would have less of a want to text and talk in class and just wait for passing period to roll around before we talk. The more we talk the more we will have less to talk about and eventually we will be forced to pay attention in class. If you let us use our phones during restricted times then our grades will go up also the amount of us listening in class will increase.

If you restrict the use of phones altogether then the amount of students using phones during class will increase and grades will decrease. Also if you ban phones then more student will be talking in class rooms. More students will be less likely to listen and pay attention then students that don't even have phones or friends.

In all consideration the best chose is to let what is already going to happen, happen and if the turn out is the same then so be it. What the best thing is to do mite just be the opposite of what could seem to be the obviously right thing to do. With that will leave you with the option of what to do about this rule.
