Mars is a very interesting planet with many marvelous sites. It is even called the Red Planet thanks to its bright red hue. Also, Mars has a region called Cydonia. This region contains the popular "Face on Mars". The Face is believed to be an alien artifact.

In 1976, scientists discovered one of the biggest wonders in the world ... "the Face on Mars". This happened during one of Viking 1 missions to look for a landing site for his sister ship, Viking 2. Scientists guessed it to be another "Martian messa", which was common in the region of Cydonia. After unveiling the image to all people, "to attract attention to Mars", many people believed that it was evidence for life on the Red Planet. Some people even said that " the Face is "bona fide" evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide" but, "defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars", which shows that NASA would actually benefit from an alien life form so they had no reason to hide it from the world.

There are many facts that help support the fact that there is no alien life form on Mars. For example, in 1998: the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of the Face on Mars, which was ten times sharper than the Viking photos, that revealed the "Face" to actually be a natural landform. Still not all people believed, so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a second look of the Face. The picture was taken by a camera in which, "each pixel in the image spanned 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." The picture taken by this camera ended up showing a "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa" and not a face built by an alien civilization. In conclusion, you could still believe there to be aliens on Mars, but you would just be ignoring the facts that the scientist of NASA have presented in their photos of Mars from the years 1998 and 2001.
