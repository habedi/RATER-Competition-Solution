Imangine being able to know the emotions of students during class, such as when they are bored, or when they are confused. Thats what the new Facial Action Coding System would achive. This kind of technology in the classrooms would be a nessestiy for teacher to effectivy teach to thier students, and idetify when they need help, or when they are getting bored during thier lesson.

Studnets get bored during class, and dont pay attention becuase of that. Students also get confused during class, but sometimes a bored student can get confused with a student that is confused on what the teacher is taling about and needs help. The FACS would change that, becuase teacher would be able to analyze whether their students are either board or confused, or enjoying their lessons.. It would also help teacher identify which lessons thier students are enjoying, and would be able to use that data to plan which lessons to include, and which lessons or activitys to throw away becuae they are boring and would not do the theire students any good."'A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Haung predicts 'Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"' (D'Alto). Meaning that the FACS can help with digital lessons too, improving the effectinsy of them as well. Another asepct fo the FACS, is that it can help students learn more about identifying emotions. "To and expert, faces dont lie; theses muscles clues are somtimes used tospot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isnt't being truthful" (D'Alto). This tecnolgy can spark an interest in psycology in students making the more interested in learing about emotions and how they can idedetify them in their peers. It can also cuase students to be interested in the technology behind it all. "His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code" (D'Alto). This can also spark a interest in coding and working with computers.

Therfoe, the FACS will be a valuabel tool for eaching in the classroom, for both the teachers, and the students. people assuem tht sudents do bad in school becuase they dont pay attention, but thsi is usualy becuase the lessons are either confusing or boring.
