Dear to whom it may concern,

I love doing community service. I believe a student should be required to do community service. Volunteer work helps people get involved in the community and, find out what is going on. It may also help you meet new people and, also opens your mind to new experiences. Also, you might find that you would like to have a career to what you already help do. Usually, people who need volunteers try to accommodate the volunteers schedule. Besides if you really wanted to do community service at a specific place you would try to make some time for that certain activity. On a college application community service would impress Head of Administrations especially if you showed consistency and volunteered at that place for a very long time. This would show how committed you are and how you possibly never give up easily. It may also show that you always finish what you start. That shows a sense of accomplishment. If your parents are not willing to drive from here and there maybe you could volunteer at school after school. My two good friends volunteer in the school library. They enjoy it very much so they work there schedule around it. I strongly believe that volunteer work should be mandatory. It would show what committed young pupils there are at this school.

Sincerely,
