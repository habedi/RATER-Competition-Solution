So you think Aliens created this historical peace of fiction. Aliens would seem like a good idea but wheres the evidence? People come up with these therories and cant support them in the way the were ment to be supported. These pictures we got from Mars are not just supported but we got the pictures with our satelite.

We scientist over in NASA are trying to find ways to expand human nature. People keep saying Aliens did this and thats making us want to explore this more even though the theory can't be supported. We spend billions of dollars a year trying to find these answers to lifes mysteries.

We even supported this in with facts about water on Mars and the mini volcanoes. The landform was a coquencedence that it was caught by our cameras and the fact about it is if this landform happened by aliens wouldn't the camera caught it? The face was first saw in 1976 and it looked like a wave of water splashed over it and dried. The volcanoes could have also erupted and hardened so the landform would have to have been there to heating and cooling of molten lava.

Even though the alien evidence can be proven it still is in the picture. The landform could have been a sign that the aliens put out and wanted help. It could have also been a sign for what is to come. The alien therory isnt well thought out, but in life anything can happen.

The face on Mars could have been anything. The things to come is what is really important. Whether it's aliens on mars or robotic warfare. The golden age of technology is here.
