i thnk students will not benefit from attending classes at home because its not the same as studying with a teacher, at school. if i was in this position i know for sure that i wouldnt be paying attention and be distracted all day because i go out with friends and family. at the same time if i were to take the classes at home, it would benefit me by being home with family, be able to go to work early, and actually participate because it would allow me to be on my own, alone and i like to be alone. Another benefit of attending school at home is that you will not have to drive, get stuck in traffic, and will be able to save money. If i were to take classes at home my mom will be on me about school because she really wants me passing and not failing. One thing i wouldn't like, would be working on my own because at times i do like to work on my own but mostly, i would like doing partner work with a friend. A goood thing about classes at home would be that you would be on your own schedule not like at school, you can sleep in more then wake up and start some classes, or you can do classes at a later time.
