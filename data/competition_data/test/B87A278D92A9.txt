A 3-D computer that has been made to show the emotions of a person has been in the works. It has been tested on paintings like the Mona Lisa showing her emotions. What if schools had computers like these 3-D ones for school allowing them to be more advanced then before. I believe these computers can allow schools to raise test scores, help counsleors, and make classes more fun.

I believe that these 3-D compters could be able to help out test scores because they could tell when theres a confusing lesson or boring one. These computers could be able to detect when a student is confused on a lesson or even bored. I believe this could be helpful for teachers because they can change the way they teach there lesson in a more understanding way thus have better test scores.

My second argument on why these computers could be useful to schools is helping out kids who are scared to talk out on their probelms. I think counsleors could find a machine like this useful for students who still fear tallking to them. Not only that but these machines could help them know when kids in class are sad or angry.

My last argument is making lessons more fun. These computers can be able to see the students who find lessons or schools boring. Thus could help teachers know to make the class lessons better to have more students excited for class.

I am for schools having these computers. These schools coudl realy be more advanced then ever with them. I think they would help schools with scores, help counsleors, and make classes more fun.
