Do you agree or disagree, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I disagree with this decision because, students may be uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on student council. Some students may not have the transportation from school after they are finished with the activity. Also, some students may have important things to do at home everyday after school.

Students may be uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. These activities may not be easy for him or her to do. These activities may not be his or her thing. Some may never picture themselves doing these kind of activities. Some students may be interested in doing a different activity. Also, most students would rather go home after a long day at school.

Some students may not have the transportation from school after they are done with the activity. Some parents may be at work, and can't pick them up. The student's coach or another student's parent may not feel like or cant take the student home. Also, some students parents or guardians, may not have a vehicle to pick their child up.

Students may have important things to do everyday after school. Most students have chores to do at home. They may have lots of homework and studying to do also. They may have to get their little siblings off of the bus. Also, they may need to get rest for a different activity outside of school.

The principal should rethink about this idea, because some students have reasons why they can't participate in his or her school extracurricular activities. Such as, students being uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. No transportation from school, after they are done with the activity. Also, some students have important things to do at home after school. This decision is not a good idea for the students. Let students make their own decisions about what they would like to do!
