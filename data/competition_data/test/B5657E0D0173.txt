It is vary dangerous to explore it because because of the extream heat and the high pressurebut i think it would be worth it. I think it is a vary interesting planit because i would like to know if there is any other life than what is on earth. I dont think that earth is the only inhabbited planet.

In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author says there are valleys, mountains, and craters. I think it would be nice if they could think of a way to explore venus but i dont know if that will happen because we might not be advanced enough. If we where able to get on the planet with out dieing we might find out that there was life on it or there might still be life on there that had to adapt to the envierment.

There are alot more planets out in the univers we shout see how far we can get. We might find other planets with life on them. I dont think we should just focus on this one planet. All they are doing is waisting recources on one planet that they could be using on other panets.
