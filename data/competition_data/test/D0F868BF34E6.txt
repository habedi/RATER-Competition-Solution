I think that the face on mars is just a nautral landform because the text states that few scientists believed it was an alien artifact. Also, the passage says that on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and the team snapped a picture, revealing that it was just a landform. Even though the team did this, people still beleive that it was a face. The Face of Marshad become a very big thing for pop culture. It was on TV, was in books, and on the radio.

We see things in everyday life like clouds. They remind us of animals, objects, maybe even memories. I cannot make a conclusion and say that cloud is a bunny and think that one day a bunny was in the cloud and it's face started to form. It is based on your perspective. To me, it looks like a natural landform on Mars but maybe to other people it looks like some type of ancient face. If people think it is an ancient face then people are going to ask questions then it creates an even bigger mystery. This was just coencidence. So, that is why I think that the creation on Mars is just a natural landform.
