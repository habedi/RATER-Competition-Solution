Dear Principal,

I have heard the issue that you are having choosing between the two policies on cell phones. The first being that we can use them during lunch and free times and the second being we can't use them at all. I think that the first policy is the best. I say this because I think that as long as they aren't using them during class it won't harm them. Why not let the students use their cell phones on their free time?

I believe that this policy will work because of all the complaints from the students about not being able to use cell phones at all in school. I think that if we loosen up on the rules, the students will be less tempted to text during class and times where they shouldn't be. We all know that most students don't abide by the rules and they text in class. I have to say that I am one of the guilty ones also. I believe that it is completely unfair that during our own free time, when we aren't doing anything important, that we can't use our cell phones. It honestly doesn't make any sense to me.

Some may argue with my reasoning and I understand that we may run into some counter arguments. Many people may say that we might as well stick with the old rule on not allowing cell phones at school at all because we know the students will still text in class as well as free time and lunch. This may be true, although I think that if we give them more freedom that we will have less of a chance of a chance of running into these problems. Teenagers are going to be teenagers, when you tell them not to do something, they are going to be more compelled to do it. It is a proven fact. If we allow them time in the day to use cell phones, and show them that you trust them enough to give them this advantage, there is no doubt in my mind that the rate of students texting in class would drop dramatically.

In conclusion I feel very strongly about the first policy being enforced into our schools. I think it gives the students more freedom, which is all they want. This policy could do nothing but make the school system better. I know that if we use this policy that we will improve as individuals, and as a school. So put the first policy in act. There are many reasons why you should, and very few of why you shouldn't. So why not?

Sincerely,
