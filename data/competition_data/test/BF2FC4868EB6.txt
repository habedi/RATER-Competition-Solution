I think the Seagoing Cowboys program should be broght back because it helps people around the world. It gives the Seagoing Cowboys the chance to learn diffrent languges. It also gives the Seagoing Cowboys the chance to foster exchange students.

It helps people around the world by giving them food. It gives them food by the cattle that the Seagoing Cowboys bring to them after a atacke or a war has hapened. Plus the Seagoing Cowboys have to learn to take care of the cattle that helps them. It helps the loackels with the damage. That was the first reason

The secand reason. It gives the Seagoing Cowboys a chance to lern diffrent langes. It dose this by when the Seagoing Cowboys travel to many diffrent countreis the may pickup on the langeuse. If the go to China the might pick up on Chinases. If they go to France they might pickup italan. If they go to spain they might pickup Spansish.

The third reason. It gives Seagoing Cowboys the chance to foster exchange stundets. It dose this by you traviling all over the globe and just fall in love with the kids. so when they come over during the school year you just foster them because you love them. It gives the kids a chance to have a proper eductian.

Weshould bring back the Seegoing Copwboys program because it is fun exciting and a lot more. But most inportinal it is helping the worlds people. It helps the people by giving them food. Fostering there kids whale they are here for a prpoer eaductain. And it helps the Seagoing Cowboys be good at heart. So therfor we should breing back the Seagoing Cowboys program.
