dear, state senator i argure that they should keep the electoral colege because it states in paragraph 1 that "the college is a process,not a place" so without it there would be no process to help figure out whitch person the president it not to mention are founding fathers established it in the constitution to compromise between elections by th evotes in congress. also the college process consists of eselections of electors and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. if we get ride of the college we will not have equal member. as you red more you notice that it says the college is widely regarded and without the electors we would not be able to elect are president. there are five reasons why we sould keep the college the electoral college is required to be there to elect the president the college restores some of the wight in the politics the collage also avoids the problem of election they are likley to be the most thankful votes they will be the person that gets the most informatiom and attention from the candidates.

the college also helps to make sure there is no pressure for run-off election.

this is my agument stating why you should keep the electoral college open thank you for your time and consisteration taylour sands
