I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.

When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.

Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high school college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.

Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.

In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as well due to the amount of time given.
