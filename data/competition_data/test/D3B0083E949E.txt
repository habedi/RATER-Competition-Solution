Driverless cars seem to be a great adance in todays technological society. However in my opinion I feel as though I personally would not use driverless cars while going to work or dropping my kids off at school. I would find it almost pointless to create let alone own a driverless car.

I personally would only use driverless cars on road trips when your tired of having to consintrate on the road you could just lay back relax and enjoy the scenery. I suppose the existence of driverless cars on a highway would be helpful in the sense of having less traffic jams or collisions. However, I feel that the car should have an on and off switch, in the sense of the driverless feature not the turning the car on and off we already have that.

Safety is one of my top concerns when I think about a driverless car. How will it detect the police when they need to get pass to an emergency? How will it pull into a gas station so it can be refilled for gas? A few new cars today have alot of new cool safety features such as stopping when sensing an obsticale ahead or cameras on side view mirriors and even a camera to assist in reverse driving.

Another thing abput driverless cars is what they mentioned in paragraph nine. Who would be responsible if the car crashes and someone is injured? The driver or the manufacturer? Also some states believe that the cars are not yet safe enought to be driven so they ban testing the driverless car in their state. Does this mean that we wont have safe driverless cars until the next few generations?

In conclusion I believe that driverless cars are useful but need alot more improvement before being sold to the public. If the improvement in technology makes streets safer to drive on then great.
