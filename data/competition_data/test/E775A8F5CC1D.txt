Have you ever thought about what the world would be like if we limited the car usages ? I have , I think about it when I wake up late and there is alot of traffic ! If we didn't use cars and we just got around by walking , riding a bike , a school bus , a city bus or even taking taxis it would be easier . It would save us time and resources . It would aslo , lower the emissions . Lastly , it would improve our safety .

If our world was car free , it would save us time and help conserve resources . How? We would all be on a schedule and we wouldn't have to do things at different times and end up being late to work , or to school , or even to something very important . You wouldn't have to worry about wasting time fixing your car while you could be at a job interview or getting a scholarship . A car is a lot of responsibilty , believe it or not . We wouldn't have to depend on our friends or parents to car pool us .

According to David Goldberg all of the development since World War Two has been centered on cars . Back in the day , they used to walk or ride on carrages with horses and carts . Now we have motor vehicles that runs on gasoline , deisel , or even a battery . Who ever invented these things made it easier for us , but now they're going out of hand with it because there is alot of traffic and very many car accidents . Wihout cars it could be a good opportunity to take away stress and to lower air population . Studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars , driving less , and fewer licenses are being purchased .

Safety is a very important role in our lives , right ? If you want to be safe at all times and not have to worry about someone drinking and driving or someone being on a high speed chase and crashing into you , you should deffinitly think about being car free . There are at least about 5 accidents a week because of people not paying attention to where they're going or even just because people like to take driving as an advantage . If there were less cars in the world , there would be less death rates . Someone could be dying in an ambulence and all the traffic could be stopping them from staying alive , when they could be to a hospital and cured .

While people are driving around trying to fight traffic just to get to work or a doctors appoitment you could already there . Many people don't like to walk or maybe even ride a bike because either they're lazy or they just don't care about their health . But there are many other options , such as taking a city bus , a train , a taxi , and maybe even a sub . If we limited the car usages we could be saving time and conserving resources that could be used for more other useful things . Also , it would lower emissions and we'd have less stress . Finally , it would decrease the number of accidents and improve our safety habits .
