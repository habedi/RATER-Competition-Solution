There has been a new breakthrough in computer facial recognition software. This breakthrough is called the Facial Action Coding System, also known as the FACS. The FACS is a facial recongnition software that is used to determine someone or something's emotions. In the article, this software is used on the Mona Lisa, to determine that she is eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. Some people beleive that this software could be useful in classroms, and i agree to an extent. This software would not be as useful to students in a traditional brick and mortar school as it would to somebody taking an online schooling program. I am an online school sudent and the FACS could be helpful in several ways.

The first way that this software could be helpful to a student would be detecting if they are bored. Much like a teacher would, if this software noticed that a student was bored during class, it could take action to engage the student more. An example of this could be if a student was simply reading through a lesson, and became disinterested. The computer could then suggest that the student watch a video on the subject instead. This would bring the student a different type of lesson, and slightly change up their day to engage them more.

Another way that this software could be useful in an online schooling program is it could detect when its students were feeling frustrated. If a student is feeling frustrated, then the software could take action against that, having the student either take a break, or putting the student in contact with a teacher so that they could work through the subject together. This would help the program have a better graduation rate, as it would help struggling students.

The final way that the FACS could be useful is to detect if a given student was sad. There is a rising problem among students, and that problem is mental illness. The most common mental illness is depression, and this program could help with that on some cases. The FACS could help by detecting that the student is sad, and alerting the student's parents, or possibly even a teacher to get in contact with the student, and talk with them about their emotions. This system is obviously not perfect, but it could help detecting early signs of depression among students.

Overall, the FACS could be very useful to an online schooling program. The software could be used to detect if a student is bored, if a student is frustrated, or even if a student was sad. These are all of the reasons that the FACS would be helpful in an online schooling program.
