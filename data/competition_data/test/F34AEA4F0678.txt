This technology to read the emotions and expressions of students in the classroom would be very helpful. Most of the time humans can't tell what a person is feeling and how they will act. With this new technology it could figure out how your emotions are and it could help out the teachers in a classroom to teach a lesson differently based on how some students are expressing their emotions. a person cant read muscles inside a persons face, only a computer can do that and that is what is so amazing about this new technology is that it can do stuff that a person can not do.

This technology could help teachers in the classroom or coaches working on film or a business, to see how all of their workers or their students are reacting to all that is being thrown at them. this benefits the teachers mostly because society has changed so much and alot of stuff is done on computers and they teach alot of lessons off of computers and in the text it says " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This means that whenever a student is sitting there learning the lesson and something comes up and they are very confused they may make a face of confusion and the computer will read that face and the teacher could know how the students felt about the lesson based on the results that the computer came up with when the students were learning the lesson. From there she could help certain students figure something out or teach them an alternative way because now she knows that some kids dont get the material. With this new technology she is able to figure out who is getting the material and who is not and before, she could not figure out if a student was having trouble with the material or not because most of the time students dont speak up and say anything when they are confused because they feel like they are the only ones who are having trouble but with this technology they dont even have to say a word they can just express their emotions and the computer will pick it up. With this new technology it knows what a fake expression is and what is not a fake expression do to the muscles inside your face. In the bottom of paragraph seen it says "They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one." This means that there is no faking out of the lesson, you either understand it or you dont and there is no slipping past it with this new technology.

In the end it makes it easier for alot of people when considering that this technology can do things that people cannot do. It will make it easier on teachers and on the students because the computer is telling the teacher how the students react to the material that is being thrown at them. the students will feel the way they feel and there is no hiding that anymore with this new technology.
