Dear Principal,

I am writing you on behalf of the community service issue, I think that you should not require students to do community services. Although community services are a good thin, some children to not have time for them. Say, for instance, you are a kid who plays many sports, you have a sport after school, and then another one after that. You wouldn't have time to do any community service, and when you do, you always get interrupted. The student might have games on the weekends, and practices on the week days. They may want to do community service, but just don't have the time.

On the other hand, there are kids that don't play any sports and have little, to no, responsibilities. They can do community service if they want to, you can never force a person to do something that they don't want to do. Those kids that want to do it, can go ahead, but i think you shouldn't make others that don't want to have to do it. There are many choices of things to do for community service. Some examples are : work at a child's hospital, or go to the local park and pick up trash. If everybody in the United States picked up at least one piece of trash a day, the world would be a way better place.

I personally, would not have much time for community service, but the time that i did have I would use. Over the summer, I normally volunteer at the local hospital. I work with children. Even if you don't have a lot of time, you can still get a lot accomplished. The little time you have, can make a world of a difference. There are some kids at hospital, that are neglected by there parents because of there illness. They want anybody to play with and they get emotionally attached very quickly.

I think kids should be responsible to making there own decision. You should offer community service jobs, but not make them a requirement. Offer ones that are local, and may sound appeal to

Kids my age. Like if you were to say that there were jobs at the mall, Ther mids would be saying "reason to. Post adds around the school, implying that you recommend that particular job.

The kids that do a certain amount of hours, should be rewarded, that can be in any way. Whether that is bye giving them candy, or giving them responsibility passes. Yes, some kids would happily do community service for fun, but don't have the time. Other kids might have all the time in the world, and not want to.

I think that it would be in the better good for all the students. Although some may be rude and turn it down, remember that it is for a reason, and you don't know what that reason is.

I hope you take in everything that i have said.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
