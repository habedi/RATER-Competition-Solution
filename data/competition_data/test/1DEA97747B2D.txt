In 1848 Antonio Meucci invented the first phone. Five years later in 1854 Charles Bourseul devised a phone. More than a century later in 1992 the first touch screen phone was invented it was called IBM Simon. This led to an evolution of phones that lasted almost thirty years later. Along with this phone evolution cars have had a just as impressive evolution as phone. In 1885 Karl Benz invented the first car. A year later Gottlied invented the engines for the car. Now although both inventions are very impressive, important, and developed well over time shouldn't mean we use them at the same time. That is why in this paper I'm going to explain why people shouldn't use cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

We have all been guilty of texting or scrolling through our social media. Sometimes we catch our self just checking our phones without any alerts going off. In the process of doing this has cause an elevation of car accident leading to serious body injures or even death. This has cause text and driving to be illegal in all states in the U.S. The national Safety Council report that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6million crashes each year, nearly 390,000 injuries occurs. Over a million Family has had to say goodbye to a family member because our need for our pones. It has increased rapidly in teen drivers because they were born in a point where, we use phones for ever thing. This doesn't just affect the victim's family the driver family will also be saying goodbye to a lover one. On May 5, 2015 texting and driving becomes illegal. Even through texting and driving didn't become illegal officially unit 2015 people have been going to jail long before then. If a person is hurt badly in an accident the driver who cause the accident will get two years of jail time and five year's probation for assault. Drivers under eighteen face a Five hunderd dollar fine and a year of a suspended license. All these facts are why I strongly disagree with texting and driving.

Using phone while driven is something that can change if you are welling. This is something that everyone has a problem with but its time that we found the solution to it now. Even if it you are telling and showing your children the proper way to operation a motor vehicle without your phone. Teens you can help by telling your friend not to use their phone when you're in the car with them. Explain the severity of the solution if they don't stop then exit the car for you own safety. This problem cannot be changed by on person, but a community of people can change it. The question now is are you willing to change it.
