In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author talks about the sister like planet to earth called venus. He makes points and observations that make the reader wonder if they think venus would be something worth investing in. Venus should be discovered more and should be thought about more because of how similar it is to are planet. There should be no reason humans can't give it everything they got and work together and explore unknown worlds.

In paragraph two the author states, "Often referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." This talks about how Venus is very similar to our planet and how there may be a chance of living on it or gaining unexplored resources. Venus is believed to have been like our planet long ago because of how similar it is to earth but we can't find out if we dont explore more into it.

In paragraph eight the author states, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." This quote explains how even though theres many risks and problems to over come, humans shouldn't stop trying and keep pushing to discover. This shows how the author thinks about humans exploring Venus, the author wants people to keep fighting and invent new technology and discover what life is outside of Earth.

The quotes given here explain how the author believes humans should keep shooting to explore Venus despite how dangerous and challenging it may be. The planet is so close and similar to ours people might as well take advantage of it and go out and see whats on it. Humans have never been stopped before by something challening. They work hard and help each other to get things done and can do anything they put ther minds to. This article is just the tip of the ice berg and maybe the start of something new, the start of exploring further beyond our reach.
