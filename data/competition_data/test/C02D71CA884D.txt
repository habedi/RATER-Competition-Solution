Waking up late and enjoying your morning is better than having to wake up before the sun rises to go to school. Distance learning is a way of going to school without actually going there physically, by taking your courses online with video conferencing. Some people may say that online courses should not be an option for students because then students could cheat or do malpractice. However, they are wrong because students are less likely to cheat because the courses are on video conference, and their parents would be watching them. Distance learning is a beneficial option for students because they will be better rested in time for their classes, they will be less likely to cheat, and they will also be safer in their own homes.

Many students get less sleep than how much they should get due to their homework and extracurricular activities, and mostly because they have to wake up very early the next morning for school. For example, some high school students go to schools that are farther away, and they have to wake up before the sun rises most of the time to be able to reach their school on time. If they were able to take online classes, they would be able to use all of that time taken up by transportation to rest and prepare for the classes. Another example is if a student gets a lot of homework from his rigorous classes and by the time he finishes them it is past midnight due to his extracurricular activities. It would be a lot more beneficial if the student was able to sleep for a few more hours and take online classes rather than waking up early and going to school. Some people may say that students should be able to finish their homework and extracurricular activities and get enough sleep at the same time. However, they are wrong because some students need more time to understand concepts, and some extracurricular activities take more time than others, which all takes away from their sleep time.

Students are a lot less likely to cheat on school work when their parents are watching them because their parents know how they act and how to stop them from committing malpractice. For example, if a student was at school, they could find a way to cheat off of their friend, but if they were taking online classes, they could not do that. If they were taking online classes, their parents would be watching them, and they don't have anyone to cheat off of at home. Another example is if a student uses an electronic device to cheat at school, but at home their parents would not allow them to have their electronic device while doing the coursework. At home students will be unable to cheat off of others or to help anyone else cheat, and they will be more focused on their own work. Some people may say that students are more likely to cheat at home because they can just use a search engine to find the answers to coursework online. However they are wrong because the online course can require the students' parents to sign off on all of the students' work, to show that they did not cheat.

Clearly, distance learning is a beneficial option for many students because it can help them get more sleep, keep them safer, and it can prevent them from cheating on assignments. Students usually receive lots of work to do with less time due to their extracurricular activities, which takes away from the time they have to sleep. However, with online courses, they will have more time to sleep and study because they will not have to wake up early in the morning to go to school. Students will also be less likely to cheat off of other students with online courses because they are usually at home when they do the assignments online, and there is nobody at home to cheat off of. It is also quieter at home and there are less distractions from their work at home than at school. If a student's home is very loud and distracting, they can always go to a quieter place, like a local library to do their coursework.
