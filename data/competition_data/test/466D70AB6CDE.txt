Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Helping, for the love of it and just to participate. These are just some of the characteristics that come to mind when you think of community service. Community service is something every one should take part in.

You should want to take part in community service just to say you did something to try to assist. Community service is good because your not only helping yourselves, you are helping all the others in your community. If you were to see people outside helping what would you do? Would you sit there and watch? Of course not, you would want to get up and do something too. Furthermore, doctors do say those without guilt have a longer lifeline than those who do.

Community service would just make it easier on everyone. If your assignment was to go clean up a beach do you know haw many animals you would be saving? Lots Dolphins, Squids, Jellyfish, Pelicans and much more. Also you would be able to help out some elderly men and women. They may need some help rolling around in a wheel chair, or getting up and down stairs what ever is necessary. Because, those helping will always be there to help.

Granted, some other people may say that volunteering is a waste of time. Those people are dead wrong, in fact, your helping people to make it easier on themselves to lighten their load. Or people may say that it doesn't mean anything. There is hardly anything more important than community service.

Just to help out and to make it easy for every one is what community service is all about. It means something and it is not a waste of time. That is why community service is something you should take part in.
