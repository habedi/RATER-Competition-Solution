Imagine being stuck at home all day and your mom being your teacher. How boring would that be right? Today we are going to take a side on if home school benefits more or if going to school does. Most schools give everyone this option to home school due to if the student can't make it to school for a reason. But they recommended going to school because it is a better way to learn. I feel like everyone learns and gets to experience more when you actually step out the house and go to school.

However people who think online school is more benefical have their reasons. Such as being able to go at their own pace or simply how it is easy to reach. These all are some benefits that online school does have, but i believe that going to school gives you these benefits and way much more. Although some people believe online school is better, Actually going to school can benefit students more because you are able to interact with more people and can seek extra help.

A big reason why going to school is better is that students get more of a experience. What does that mean? Well what i mean by that is students get to actually discover and learn more about what they are studying. For example if a student gets an option to study fahion at home or at a school in New York. It would be way much better to go study in New York because you are able to talk to industrys and other people who are into fahion as well. So if students go to school they would not online learn about the topics they are studying, but they would get speaking and other skills as well.

Also another big reason is looking for extra help or learning more than what they know. If students do online school they would'nt be able to look for extra help if they get stuck on a unit. For example this one time i could'nt make it to school due to a sickness, so I attempted learning what i missed on my own, but I did not understand it till i went back to school and my teacher expained it to me. If students got stuck like me and could not go to a resource like a school to look for help. How would they learn?

This is why i believe online school is not as benefical as they make it sound to be. So this is why going to school can benefit you way much more than online school. You dont get the benefits of interacting, experiencing and takling to other students. Overall online school will not benefit students in my opinion due to its lack of intercation with the outside world.
