Having students complete a summer project is a wonderful idea as it gets students in the habit of learning, however should these projects be designed by students or teachers? I believe these projects should be administrated and created by students as it provides a more reasonable work load, opportunities for creativity, and helps the students process the information and techniques.

Teachers often don not know how much work is enough work for the student, but who knows more about students than students. If students designed the projects they are more incline to add a reasonable amount of work while still maintaining the recommended or required information. This allows students to participate in the community more and not stress over the huge amounts of work for their projects. This leads to more time for extracurricular activities that in the end help develop these students into better citizens. For example if a student is overwhelmed by the amount of work they have, assigned by the teacher, they then dont have time to volunteer or help out in the community, which in the end effects the future of these students. Teachers could assign a reasonable course load and still achieve the same results, however if students participate in designing the project it then opens up opportunities in creativity.

Due to more time for students to participate in the community it encourages them to add creativity to their projects making it an entertaining and enjoyable experience for them. Teachers often strive for this goal but do not always achieve it due to less communication with the student therefore creating tension and demotivating the student to work. This allows students to express themselves through personal experiences and challenges they faced. A student is more incline to do their project on things they experienced or places they have been. This helps students discover their passion and even in the future their career. For example if a student volunteered at an animal shelter and discovered their love for animals and want to help more, they often base their project on the belief they stand more toward and want to enroll in more veterinary courses in the future. Teachers could encourage students to pursue their goals and appeals through personal help and motivational encouragement. However the student is restricted of these opportunities due to the project and its massive overloaded information that the teacher provided. Student based projects allow creativity to flow which help students remember and use techniques learned in the project.

Through the use of creativity and personal experiences students can learn techniques and information better since it was made by students. This allows for future success and helps students evolve as learners and innovators. The goal of the project is to maintain the habit of learning however, by introducing a more creative experience students learn more and use techniques learned in the project to help them become more successful and better students. Students who create these projects use methods that helped them learn and help other students benefit as well. Teachers help students learn but do not resonate with them fully as students could help each other through personal experiences with this project. For example a student does the project based on his hobby of fishing, he does an in depth process of research and discovers about the pollution of the Chesapeake bay. He then based his project of pollution and global warming which in the end helps him be prepared and in tune for his environmental science class next year. If teachers created these projects the students wouldnt learn as much as projects made by students as they know what is beneficial for them.

The end goal of the project is for students to maintain the habit of learning. This is achieved through student based projects and resulting in more time for students, which leads to more outbursts of creativity, and in the end helps students learn and produce content with techniques they learned in the project. These results are produced due to students creating a project that other students can rely on and what teachers cant necessarily achieve.
