Dear Principal:

There are many reasons why this policy should not be enacted in our school.

Firstly, students who do well on tests but yet a big test comes up and the student gets a grade and drops down to a C that is not accountable and fair to the student because the student worked hard the whole trimester. Just one test brought it down, and it is only one thing to bring it down, not many, but the entire test does not account for how hard the student worked throughout the trimester.

Secondly, substitutes might be there for the big test because the teacher is ill, but substitutes are not yet qualified for taking the great task of grading a test that could decide the students dreams and hopes. Yet furthermore how can we grade a students hard work on the mind of a young inexperienced person with almost no knowledge of grading tests, I cannot know , yet these teachers should go through a rigorous course in order to have the honor and power to decide a students future, irresponsible I say.

Finally, the third reason why this policy should not come to the final stage is because the other activities, not sports, like other schools like mine do not need a C average in order to participate in clubs. They can do with other grades, like at my school where students have the option and other clubs might help bring up their grades and learn new skills instead of sitting in a quiet rigorous classroom where no creative activities are formed in order to open up the child's mind to new things and possibly help this child succeed, but yet you are suggesting banning creativity and other activities if they have a C grade, yet it is the responsibility of a teacher to have creative activities, and make sure the child has other ways of making better grades, except a classroom, but you suggest on just blowing away creativity, not having any other activities to enrich children to get better grades and possibly have a successful school have better grades. In conclusion, this policy should not be enacted because the child's mind needs creative ideas to help students grow and learn.

Sincerely, the student body of the school.
