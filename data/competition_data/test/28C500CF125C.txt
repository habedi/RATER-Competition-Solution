People talk about how driverless cars are going to help the future, and its going to keep reckless drivers from being in control. Now, if you think in some aspects technology today still has not ever ran right, so why try make something so advanced if we can't even get the little things down first.

The world now in days has come to a point where technology is doing everything for us, as we come to a point where we rely on our Phones and computers to do everything for us. Dont get me wrong, technology does have its advantages, it can show us things that we never were taught how to do and help us with our history, it does help with alot of things but is it not kinda sad that we rely on it now.

I believe in some aspects that a car so advanced could decrease wrecks and reckless drivers, but if people now and days would straighten up and be the safe driver that they need to be then we wouldnt have to make a car so advanced to drive for us. Everyone is relying on their electronics to do everything for us now, but dont you think its kinda pety that we need technology to do things that we can literally do ourselves. They say in the passage that the smart car is going to need the passenger to take over on somethings, but is it not kinda scary knowing someday that technology isnt going to need our help and its going tobe doing everything for us.
