Have you ever came home and been tired but had to finish something? If you answered with yes, imagine if you had to do at least one extra activity after school. I believe that we should'nt be forced to do extracurricular activity because you might be tired after school, have to work, or help around the house after school.

My first reason is, maybe your tired after school. all of us has been tired at least once after school and wanted to sleep for a bit instead of doing your homework right away or maybe you were possibly hungry. Maybe you were sleepy and wanted to sleep for 30 minutes and then grab something to eat after you woke up from your nap.

Maybe you wanted to eat something because you haven't ate all day and its better to relax your mind instead of going right into work after school.

My second reason, is that maybe your old enough to work and have a after school job you work at for a couple of hours. You might have a job and have to work right after school and you dont come home until dark and its hard for you to do anything else after you get off work because you have to do your homework and then head to bed for the next day of school. Another thing is that maybe your schedule will be ruined if you have to do an extracurricular activity after school cause of the time and the time you might have to work, can interfere with your time schedule.

The last and final reason, is that you have to watch over your siblings after school or pet sit your neighbors dogs and walk and feed them. Sometimes, you have to watch your younger brothers or sisters and you are busy most of the time to get anything else done. The other thing is that if your parents dont come home until late you might also have to clean the house and do other things such as wash the plates, throw the trash out and many more.

Which brings me to my conclusion, we shouldnt have to do an extracurricular activities because you might be tired or you have to work and or take care of the house, So in my opinion I don't think we should have to do anything extra after school instead take the rest of the day off.
