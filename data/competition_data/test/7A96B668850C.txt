I disagree, because students should have the choice to do a extracurricular activity. Some students don't like doing sports or putting there self out there. Also some people are not good at sports. Alot people are scared because they don't want people as in students and teachers to make fun of them. Some kids are way too nervous to even get up in class and do a persontation. So I don't that students would be intressted in doing things that they know their not good at. if students are told to do something their not good at they will feel embrassed.

Students that are good at art should participate in that yearbook, if they want too. I don't think that students should be told to do something that they don't want to do. Students should not be preasured into doing things that they are not good at. If students are preasured into doing things they won't do their best. Because they will feel like they have to be perfect for everyone. But students should be encouraged into doing these things. But they should not be required to do activties.

When it comes to .P.E. every athletic students takes it so serious as if it's the NBA. For example if a class is doing basketball. And one persom does not make it into the hoop. everyone in the room will yell at him/her. The person that was shooting didn't make it in because he/she was preasured into getting the ball into the hoop. Some students are not good at any sport so therefore it should be a choice to participate in activities. Also even if someone is amazing at art they shouldn't be told to participate in the yearbook if they don't want too. some student's don't want to participate in student council, sports, and the yearbook. so it should be a choice to participate or not. Not everyone is brave enough to do these things. Student council is a pretty big thing that should be a choice to be involved in.

Student council can sometimes make students nervous because they help make decsions sometimes. They coul fall under the line of being really nervous. Because if they make the wrong decsions then everyone might get mad at him/her for not making the decsion they wanted. Being student council is not a bad thing it's just a pretty big deal. Because the student can be put under alot of preasure and stress. Too be as perfect as everyone wants the student to be. Like I said it is still the students coice is participate in student council or not.

Every activity should be a choice. Not everyone is good at sports, the yearbook, and being student council. No one should be forced into doing anything they don't want too do. Everyone has a choice to do something. No one should be forced to do a activity.
