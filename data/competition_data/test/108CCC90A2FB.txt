Dear Principle,

I think that is an excellent idea making students have at least a B average to participate in any sports or activities during school. If you keep this policy, it can really help the students to do better at two things! I think students need education before free time because when you go to college, you cant just show up and say I want to play football and just leave, you will get kicked out! I think they need students to understand the importance of what you need in the future, not jut now. For example, if you play football, cool but that probably wont get you anywhere in life. Out of this school I bet only one student will actually go through with it and turn it into their future in to NFL football out of all the fifty students. I also think if you get students to work first then they will even have more fun playing then before because after they work they get it all done and don't have to worry about teachers making them make stuff up like they probably were before. If students could just play football and not worry about their grades, they wont have anything to do in life. I also think students will pick fun over school so if you give them the work before they can do anything, then they will eventually learn some good stuff to having a B.

After knowing some students had nothing to do in life because they were working on sports than school, I would be ashamed. Its not right for students to suffer when principles can take a charge. And for some girls, they are really into volleyball but you need to know all different school related stuff for those skills. If you did horrible in school and kept failing then decided to get out of school, then you cant play sports either because they're apart of the school. And for basketball, for the plays, you need to know math in order to do anything! If they don't care about their education or math, they will also do horrible in sports so you need school. But for students, if you don't have to do something that's school related, then people aren't going to do it so you have to make it a rule to be a B average at least.

Actually a B isn't that hard of what you are asking, it isn't an A like its impossible to get. Its just asking for the same effort some students out into their sports.

I think before this gets passed onto next generations, we have to change it now before more students live it.

Students might only get the B average to play sports but its better than a C because at least you know they are still learning to get that B for quizzes they have to do. But i think that will be a great idea to make it a B average. Also at this school we have activities that students love.

I like being in the club No Place for Hate and i understand if my grade is a C i wouldn't be able to do it so I will make sure I don't get lower than a B even so I can be in the club because I like it. It is also kind of an award, a privilege to be in certain clubs and if you cant still keep your grades, you loose it till you get your grades up again. In the later run, I think tons of students would be thankful for the principle actually standing up to the students. Making a B average to any sports or activities is a great idea. It can really help students out. I know sports is a big thing, I even like sports and the activities we have but its not going to be easy for us in high school or college so we need to get prepared before it is too late.

Thank you for my opinion,
