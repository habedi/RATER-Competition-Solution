Dear principal,

I think that student should be required to take part in community service because there are many benefits that can come from helping others. One of which can be learning a new skill or ability. One example could be if you are performing a service in an office like building you can learn the skills to be a good secretary. Also if you are performing an activity that requires a great amount of work such as delivering heavy packages you could improve your motor skills and become stronger an more fit. Another benefit that could come from community service could be improving your reputation around your community. If people that don't really know you see you helping others they may want to get to know you and might become friends with you. Performing community service can also make you a much better person. By this I mean that community service could teach you that there is much more you can do with your time after school than going onto Facebook, Aim, playing video games, and watching television. My last example is that community service could also improve the ability of a student to work together with others. If there are a group of people performing community service with each other the service could teach them to work as a team and to help each other out. In conclusion I think that community service should be mandatory in school.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
