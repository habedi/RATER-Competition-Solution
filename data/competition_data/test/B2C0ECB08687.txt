I agree that they should do the activity Because it can show the teachers of what you know about if you participate. So they dont't repeat it more then once. Like let's say there was a game that a teacher put at the smart board and you need to participate to play. That can also help you review of what you don't understand. To pass your SOL is to review everything we discuss about. When you participate it's also showing the teachers that you already know everything and what you know about and it's also showing that you been following the directions and paying attention in class. It helps students learn fast in other ways. Students can learn fast sometimes when you participate. I once participate like every time in math but once I kept doing it until I understand everything and then I get better and better that no student don't have to complain about it any problem that we don't understand about it. I understand people do not like it but it is what it is. Like my brother never participate but he is no matter what they would say to him that he needs to participate for his grades.

I disagree I guess because people don't like to participate like they can be nervous sometimes and they just don't feel like it. Like sometimes people be shy and are scared. Because when the teacher calls out there name they have to stand up and participate and there scared because they dont know the answer and there like standing up there knowing nothing which makes them feel like there going to say "i don't know". Some students want to participate because they know what to answer the question. some do not because they be shy, nervous, and scared. But I was thinking why not participate when we want to. Because people be uncomfterabe like students sometimes be lazy that they do not wanna participate on anything they want or have too and they sometime be stressed about it I sometimes see them having an attitude but I don't know what's up with them but my countselor told me to focus and I alsways be tryig to focus and my old best friend said it was stupid for just trying to get your grades up but not focused on my friends but to be honest grades are much more important and that is why I always go traight to class.

Like we need to participate there is no other choice because that help us learn but I agree because students need too get use to talking in front of everyone. Like I know where shy, nervous, scared, and uncomfterable but I Know we'll get use to that. Because high school is different and I know we'll do that in school so obviously I'm a get use too it. Like writing a speech I know that could be nervous becuase you need to make one and it could be long. but reading in front of everyone is fine everyone does it. I once was scared until I know everyone I didn't feel nervous or anything. I know people don't like to paticipate because there lazy or maybe because there tired and nervous I get now why people don't wanna participate on anything else now.

I guess once you know everyone and friends with them your not like nervous anymore or anything like your comfterable with them because you know them I mean that happen to me. I'm just friends with all my classmates and not even afraid to stand up and say something I'm guessing get use to what your afraid of then you don't have to worry no more and just speak up and finally participate. Of what you know and of what the teacher show you to pass your SOL. Students go to school to learn to learn of what you do not know but want to know once you grow up. When my mom was a thirteen she didn't went to school and now I go to school and I wanna tell her everything so she knows too. When my dad was thirteen he didn't went to school either because my gandma did not have enough money to pay for my parents but now I go to school and I wanna learn something that could happen here on this earth like I wanna know more about this earth something intresting. Like the coronavirus that's in va right now I wanna know more about it to help my family get through it.

I agree with this that people should participate on anything rather there scared or not I agree. Because students should learn once they participate like the game on the smart board. Once I participated on math class and answer my teachers questions that I kept messing up because I didn't know but I wasn't nervous I asked a question or kept trying to get the answer even though I try to guess to get an answer. My parents really want me to have a A in all my classes. I see some students that doesn't wanna work in any classes and they don't want to participate because they don't know and because they don't wanna learn anything like my best friend she does not want me too teach her of what I know. Like all she does is talking with boys and boys but what's important right now is the grades so i can get my dream job and have a nice life with my family and friends and most importantly is not going back to a grade that your in right now and like I been participating since I was a kid in elementary school. I'm here to learn and help my family after the coronavirus my mom is scared so am I because I'm afraid that I'm a die they say coronavirus can kill you and now I wanna learn more about it like maybe read more books about it and find some more definitions about it to let my family and friends know what does it do and what causes it. I agree that they should do the activity to get a good grade and if not participate then you won't be able to pass and move on to learn something new grades are important so I say yes to do the activity even if it's hard we'll keep trying it to finish and to pass and get a A in every class like science we have to do a project then we need to do it in order to know and have a A in that class and the rest the same thing like almost all the classes are like the same which we might do a lot in high school.
