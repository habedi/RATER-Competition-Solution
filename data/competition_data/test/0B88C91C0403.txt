If you were a student in school with a lot on your plate, wouldn't you find it more beneficial to work from home instead? Students get stressed going to school everyday. Sometimes, they don't feel comfortable and they just want to get away to their homes. They'd rather attend class from home than going to school to attend classes. While although, that idea sounds nice, it's not beneficial to students. Most students wouldn't even bother to attend classes from home because they'll be distracted and that'll cause them to fail. It's more beneficial for students to attend classes at school because it'll help them concentrate and, the concentration will help them succeed.

Expanding on the idea of concentration, the students would have a higher concentration level if they attended classes at school rather than at home. For instance, they're less likely to be distracted by anything because the teacher would keep their attention on the class. The teacher's main objective is to keep the students engaged in to the subjects that they're teaching to them. The teachers could do that by having students participate in hands-on activities. Or, teachers could incorporate interesting videos and demonstrations in order to keep the students' attention level high. All together, if classes kept the students concentrated then, they'd feel like attending classes at school would be far more beneficial to them than attending classes at home.

Furthermore expanding on concentration, maintaining high concentration levels while attending class at school could push for a higher succession rate. This means that students are more capable of achieving their full potential while in the classroom than at home. To do this, the teachers have to maintain the concentration levels of the students and have to push them to produce the best work that they can. In a classroom environment, students would be more influenced to create their best bodies of work through the encouragement of teachers also. Through both high concentration, influence, and encouragement, the students will be able to pass with great success if they attended class at school. Therefore, this gives attending classes at school a more beneficial edge.

Now while students would benefit more from attending classes at school, attending classes from home also has it's perks. Students would be able to get more sleep in the morning instead of worrying about getting ready to attend class at school. Students would also be comfortable at home in their own environment rather than them going to an environment that's outside of their house. Now, as much as that sounds great, there are also a lot of distractions at home and negative perks with attending classes at home. The student could sleep in and not attend class at all that day. Them sleeping in would stem from being way too comfortable. It's nice to be comfortable but, being comfortable too much could make the student lazy. It's more beneficial for students to attend classes at school because the constant interaction and engagement would push them to be the best student they can be.

Overall, it's more beneficial for students to attend class at school. They would be concentrated through interactions with the class and being interactive will push the students to perform at their best ability. With that it'll create a high succession rate of passing students, making attending class at school more beneficial for students. While although it wouldn't be bad attending class from home, it's not beneficial because students would get too lazy and that'll cause them to fail. So attending class at school could be more beneficial to a student than attending class from home.
