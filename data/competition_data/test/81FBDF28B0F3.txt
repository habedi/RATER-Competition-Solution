There are many reasons to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are many things you do in this program. Such as taking care of animals for all the animal lovers out there such as horses, cattle, and mules. You also get to travel around the world and meet new people. Most importantly you get to help people that have gone through some thing terrible such as World War II. Many of the animals are just taken in by people while unloading them. You dont just take care of animals. When you're half way across the country you to have some fun. After unloading you have some free time. So while you are there you plat tenis, baseball, vollyball, tabletennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittleing,and games also help pass time. But you don't just play games you also get to explore China, Asia, Europe, Austrailia, and Africa. You can take tours of France, Italy, Greece, and many more.
