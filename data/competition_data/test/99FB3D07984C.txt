In this world we live in everyone wants to get where they want to go without any problems, and everyone uses cars for transportation, thats the real problem. There are places where you not allowed to have a car, I dont blame them."When i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way," said Heidrun Walters. Everyone has told me that they arent worried about how they drive, they are worried about everyone around them. i dont see how that is a good thing, but if we limit the transportation of cars no one will have to worry.

Driving cars isnt healthy for the environment either. "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." This world gets trashed every single day, so why do we feel the need to add to the problem. "Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," if we can make this world cleaner i dont see why people wont step in, we are the ones who have to live with it everyday.

"Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." People are starting to see a change happen, and they are acting on it. Just imagine a life without cars driving everywhere. You wont have to worry about drunk drivers, the reduce of car crashes, there will be a incredible decrease in people dying from car crashes, you wont have to worry about getting to work on time because there wont be traffic."Pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, commericial and public transportantion traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."
