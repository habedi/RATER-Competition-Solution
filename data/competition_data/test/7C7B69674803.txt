Some schools allow online courses to be taken by online video conference. I don't think that students should be allowed to work from home. Here is why I do not think that students should work from home.

First of all, the learning environment would be different at home than it is at school. By allowing students to learn from home they would be too busy playing on their phone or watching television rather than paying attention and actually learning. Though some students may pay attention while they are at home, more students will not and focus on other things which will distract them from learning.

Another reason is that teaching are different when compared between online and at school. When students are at school, if they have a problem they can raise their hand to ask and the teacher will come and explain it. Versus at home, where a student will have to stop the lesson of the entire class to ask a question. Even if the student asks the question online, the teacher may not understand what the student is asking and wont be able to see the students work because it is online.

Finally, if students did not go to school and worked from home, many more kids would be socially awkward. If student work from home they would be able to make friends with those around them. They would not know how to share or to work as a team. Because students go to school, they see who people, their life, the religion, culture, and how they act around others. Because they see how others act they learn to adapt and to talk and work with others as if you worked from home you would talk to no one.

In conclusion, I disagree that students should be allowed to work from home.
