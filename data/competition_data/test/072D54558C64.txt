My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.

People who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.

If driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.

Having drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem. That might be a soultion to our probelm of accidents and it will still allow people to drive.

Another thing to think about is the laws that will have to change for these people to make these cars. Like speed limits and how the car will cars handle traffic in large cities. We alos have to think about if they are really a energy saver car or if it is just as bad as the cars we are using.

In conclusion, I think that this car shouldn't be developed for the reasons of safety. This car may have some very nice aditions to it but we still have to think about whats best for the drivers. The cars that we drive now can use some new technogly but having a driverless care kind of seems a little to extreme. People love driving so why not keep the cars we have today and just keep inproving to make them better for us.

But i feel like before anyone makes thier minds up about whether we should or shouldn't uses these cars that are driverless there needs to be more research done and tests to see how these cars work.
