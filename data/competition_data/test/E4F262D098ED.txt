Every student looks forward to the school year being over and going on sunny vacations for the summer. In some schools the learning standards require students to complete a summer project. The purpose of this is to help students retain previous learning from the school year. These projects should be teacher-designed because if students were to come up with the design for the project the concept may become unfair to other students and grading these projects would be harder for the teacher if he or she misunderstands the students point they were trying to explain.

Firstly, a student-designed project can put some kids at a disadvantage to resources. Some students may not have access to the internet or other devises to complete their project. If a project is assigned that require students to go out and complete an activity it could be expensive. Making the projects unfair for students who have low income families. The children in these families may be embarrassed about their money situation and not speak up for themselves and decide to figure out how they are going to complete the project later.

Secondly, a teacher-designed project would be easier for teachers to grade. They would have a better understanding of what to look for in a project and how to properly and fairly grade the students work. A student who has done a good project could get a poor grade if the teacher grading the project does not understand the concept the students was trying to convey. Also, a teacher-designed project would be easier for the students. They would have a crystal clear rubric and know exactly what their teacher was grading them on so that way the student is confident about their work.

Some people may say, a student-designed project would increase the likelihood of students completing the project over the summer if they came up with the idea behind the it. However, students should complete the project regardless of who designed it. The student should know and consider the importance of the project for their grade in the class. These projects are designed to help the students and to not hurt their grades.

In conclusion, a project designed by a teacher will organizes the learning criteria better than if a student had designed it. Making grading easier for teachers and constructing projects that are fair for the students. Summer projects may not sound exciting but they are healthy for the brain and once you finish them you can hang ten for the rest of the summer.
