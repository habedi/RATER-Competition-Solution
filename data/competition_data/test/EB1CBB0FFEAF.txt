Summer is the time for relaxing. The warm, sunny days help keep the stress down, and it gives freedom to the kids in school. Although, that freedom comes to a small halt when summer projects are assigned. Summer projects are given so the students dont forget what they learned during the year. These assignments are normally teacher-designed, but on rare occasions, students will design them too. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is already pre-planned throughout the year, it could mean less work for the students, and it could be easy on the teachers and the students.

Teachers that teach the same topic get together sometimes during their planning periods to have a meeting. This meeting lets teachers plan future assignments for their students. These assignments could be homework, notes, tests, and even summer projects. Summer projects are usually planned way in advance so the teachers can lead up to it at the end of the year when the students know everything. The teachers always want to make sure that the students know everything before they assign the project. Then once the time comes, the teacher will assign the summer project to the well prepared students.

Students want to enjoy their freedom from school, and teachers know that. Its more likely for teachers to hand out less work so that the teachers can easily grade them and finish before most of the summer is taken up. Back in elementary school, teachers usually hand out summer reading lists to students to encourage them to read over the summer. This summer reading list usually gave prizes to students who completed the list. All they had to do was read the book that was assigned and then give a small summery of what happened. Reading is something many people do naturally when they have free time or before they go to bed. This assignment doesnt require much work at all, and it gives the students all the time they need to finish, and it can help teachers relax too.

Summer is not only for students, but its also for the teachers and faculty too. The teachers would want to plan something easy for the students so they can comeback to school knowledgeable, but also fresh. They want to challenge the student while also letting them enjoy their three month break from school. Teacher-designed projects will more likely lean more on the easy side of things. When teachers plan for the future, they can also plan to have the students learn everything to know before the summer project comes up, and when it arrives, the students will already know how to complete the project within the first few days of the assignment.

Teacher-designed assignments are great and all, but students know what they want. As it may seem, student-designed assignments would be better because it gives the student more of a choice on the topic of to do for the project; however, the student may not be prepared enough for their choice of topic. If the students choose to make their own project, then some might not know what to do and then will fail the assignment due to lack of information on how the project works. Teacher-designed projects are always planned accordingly to the knowledge of the student and will always be good on the student.

In conclusion, teachers should always make their summer assignments. Teachers know all too well of what the future holds for their given subject. Teachers want to enjoy their summer too, and they want it to last just as long as the students. They want everything to be super easy so they can get it over with as quick as possible. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because it is already pre-planned throughout the year, it could mean less work for the students and teachers, and it could be easy on the teachers and the students for their final assessment.
