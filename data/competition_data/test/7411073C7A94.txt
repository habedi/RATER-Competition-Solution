In this essay I will talk about if the use of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) will be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. First it will be a great idea to use it because teachers will know when a student is bored.

In the article says " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". This quote shows that it will be a great helper to teachers because it could recognize when a student doesn't understand a lesson or is bored, also it could modified the lesson like a human would do it so the student will be more able to understand the lesson.

In conclusion this technology will be a great instrument for school. Such teachers like students will be benefit with this Facial Action Coding System because like I have said it will notice when a student is bored or confuse, only by looking at his face expression. And it will modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.
