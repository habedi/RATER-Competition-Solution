As a NASA scientist, I believe that the face on Mars was formed by aliens. Me as well as other scientists believe this because, we still don't know for sure that there's any life on Mars. As well of the fact that a face can't be made randomly on a planet, there had to be something that made it. When you think about it you see nothing Earth or human like on any other planet.

Well we still don't know for sure if there is any other planet with a sign from aliens but, every planet has a special feature to it. For instance Earth has weather elements such as;rain, snow, hail, and mist. Mecury is the nearest to the sun. Venus is made mostly out of gas. And Saturn as well as Uranus has rings. Neptune is the cold icy planet. Then Jupiter is the biggest planet.

Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artcraft, photograpghing Cldonia became a prority for NASA when Mars Global Surbeyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended. "We felt this was important for taxpayers,"explained Jim Garvin. These are the facts to lead me to believe that aliens created the face on Mars.
