Dear Principal,

I believe that the current cell phone policy at our school is getting out of hand. In order for students to get everything they can out of their class time, you should consider changing the policy. The policy should be that students are allowed to bring their cell phones to school, as long as they are off during class periods and other important times during school hours. Although, during free periods and lunch time the students should be allowed to use their cell phones if necessary. When students use their cell phones during class they lose valuable learning time. That time they spend texting is not letting them put all their best effort into their class work. That may hurt them later on in the future when they're presented with a difficult task. Also, using your cell phone during class time is a sign of disrespect towards your teacher. It is disrespectful because you are showing the teacher you do not care. However, students should be able to bring their cell phones to school and use them during free periods and lunch time for emergency purposes. Free periods and lunch times are for socializing with friends and classmates. By using their cell phones to talk on the phone or text message will not end up hurting them in the long run because they are not missing out on any important educational information. This policy would be beneficial for teachers and students because teachers won't have to worry about students being distracted their cell phones, and students will put most, if not all of their attention to class time.

Sincerely,
