To the principal:

As time passes, technology continues to advance in the twenty first century. People are becoming more dependent on this advanced technology to complete everyday tasks, such as communication. Even young people rely on technology. Lap tops, television, and yes, cell phones.

I believe that students should definitely be allowed to take and use their cell phones at school. I understand that it is not appropriate for students to use cell phones in class; that's learning time. However, I see no issue with students using them at lunch period or during free times. In fact, I think it would be beneficial.

For example, students would not need to make trips to the office to call their parents if they need something, which would be less of a hassle. The student could just wait until a passing period, and then call whoever they needed to call.

I'm sure that teachers worry about cell phone use in class. But, I think that if a student knew that he was given the privilege of having a phone at school, than he would have no need to break the rules in class. and if he did, then punishment would be appropriate. If students aren't allowed to have their cell phones at school, they will sneak around to use them! So let us have them at the appropriate time! There would be less rule breaking without the rule.

So here's a wrap: students should be able to bring their cell phones to school and use them at appropriate times. It would make happier students and teachers. Parents too! Option one, for sure(:
