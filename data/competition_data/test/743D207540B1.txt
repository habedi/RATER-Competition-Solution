Dear Principal,

I like the idea that all students must have a B average to participate in any activities but, there's one problem. Many students at our school can't maintain a B average because of there behavior sometimes can be a problem in class. Most of them get kicked out off class, get wrote up on a referrals, parents get called, and etc. I understand what your trying to do but, if there's no sport or other activities then there's no us. I'm suggesting that what you need to do is lower the standards at the school to a high C average such as 74% and above. Then maybe that will make a difference to the school and they will try to keep there average up so, that they can play sports or other activities. I know they can do it because I'm one of the A/B average students at this school and I represent my school well. So, if you could just change that one thing in our policy I promise you that you want be let down and I will try to set a meeting or announcement about it and get more students involved in this issue since i' m in student council.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
