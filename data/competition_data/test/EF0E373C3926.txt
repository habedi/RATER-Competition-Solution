The UNRRA progam is a great progam for people who want to help around the world. Also, if you are into going on trips o different places this is great for you. They travel all around the world helping and they also get to see knew things!

You should come join because you can help around the world! Many people love to help and around the world and you should try it. On the first time my friend Don and I went on the trip it was great how we could help people after the war. Like how we brought a cago of 335 horses along with enough hay and outs to feed them. We wanted always make sur ethat we cleaned all the mess the war's had left behind.

You should also come to he program because you have the benifet of visiting all inds of places like Greece, China, Europe, and more. By the time I was discharged in in 1947, I been on nine trips. That is more than any other Seagoing Cowboy. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece and it was ver special. Also, in Crete I toured and excavated a castle. Then at the Panama Canal I marvled.

Going on the Atantic Ocean was awesome too! I went on it about 16 times in my years of being a Seagoing Cowboy. It took about two wees to cross it from the astern coast of the United States. To get to China it took a month to get there. Caring fro the animals kept me busy as we crossed the seas. They had to be fed two or three times a day. The time I almost wnet overboard was very scary, but I loved doing what I did.

it was very awesome helping around the world, going to all of the those amazin places, and traveling the Atlanic many times. I may have gottenhurt and times were rough, but I wouldn't chane being a Seagoing Cowboy for anthing. I was onne amazin adventure I will never forget.
