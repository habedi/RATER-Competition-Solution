I think it isn't woth it because theres really no point in doing it. I think the students wouldnt like to express how they feel and espically not to a teacher that they don't like.

A reason i think this isnt good is because why waste money on something not useful and just aste it on something that is like helping out the community or something. We could pay workers to pick up trash or something instead of just wasting it on something that says how somone feels when them themselfs can tell you how they feel and plus they feel comfotable telling you.

I also think that your feelings are your privacy and shouldnt expresse them if you don't want to. At then end of this article my opinion stays the same and hasnt changed on what i feel. Like yeah its cool to use on art and stuff like that but on students who don't want to be tested then no.
