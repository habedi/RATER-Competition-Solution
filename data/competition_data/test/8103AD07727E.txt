Over summer there is a multitude of things students want to do. None of these things are school related. Yet at the end of each school year teachers give out a summer project to these students, expecting it to be done by the start of next school year. Some times the project is to read a book other times it is to watch a movie, but sometimes it is to wright an essay or create a piece of art. All of this is assigned for a three month break, and usually a student receives a project like this from all of his or her teachers. Most these project will take 3-4 days to complete. That is around one month of summer dedicated to doing school work. How can this be made easier for students? If teachers made it simpler! Teachers should design summer projects because having predetermined topics will shorten the length of the project, project topics will be related to bettering students lives outside of academics, and topics of a similar subject will encourage student to communicate over summer.

While some people believe that students should design these projects by themselves. Citing that it will help the students to learn more and they are more likely to be enthusiastic about his or hers own project. When students design there own project he or she can pick the subject, the method, even the form of presentation. Nevertheless, with such a broad variety of options, students could not receive credit from a teacher because there project did not have the proper category or criteria. This would lead to a student starting of the year with a low grade which could be difficult for he or she to raise depending on the grading scale.

Having a list of topics to choose from would shorten projects length by a large percent taking at the least the two to three day brain storming period away. This would give student more time to work on the project its self, and more time for he or she to do things they want to do. There is a lot of planning that goes in to summer by the students . Students sign up for trips to places all around the world other students sign up for summer jobs and some students stay home. By shortening the time it would take students to to finish there projects. Students would have more time to enjoy there break and take advantage of there much needed vacation.

When teachers design the summer project they can relate it to bettering students live outside of academics. An example being the gap between junior and senior year, most students will be doing one of three things; working at a job, working at a internship, or working on college visits. If teachers knowing that the following year the first thing students will be doing is to wright up a college essays. Making the project about researching your college of choice and finding there essay requirements. Students would be able to to do something that they already should have been working on, and with the incentive of a good grade students would put more effort in to finding this information about his or her school of choice. In other summers students can be encouraged to get internships and have jobs over summer to help set students up for the world out side of academics. By having the project relate to life outside academics teachers can help student complete projects that already relate to bettering there lives and setting them on track for a wonder full and productive life.

When student are all given choices from the same list then there topics will be similar, this will encouraging the possibility of group work. There is a large range of advantages to group work, especially, over summer. Group work can help students when they are all reading the same book or drafting the same essay. It gives students a outlet to brainstorm together and bounce ideas of each other. This can help students to grow and strengthen there ability to socialize, be criticized, and even to compromise. Group work will also help the students who are less likely to adventure of of the house during the summer months weather it is be because they are antisocial or just lazy the incentive of getting a better grade by talking to fellow class mates may encourage said students.

When teachers design project students are given more time to be them selves, more time to gain experience out side of academics, and are even encouraged to work in groups which helps students to grow as people. Summer is a vital time to teenagers and teachers should not create obstacles to take away from this important time students get to be them selves.
