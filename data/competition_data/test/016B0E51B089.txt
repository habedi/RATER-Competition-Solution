a time in the futur where no one needs to buy cars because there will be a fleet of driverless cars is not a safe futur. In paragraph nine the article says "most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers." Making a driverless car removes the alert driver wright out of the eqation. And a car without an alert driver isnt a safe car, at least not in law makers eyes.

In states like California, Nevada, Florida, and the district of columbia it is illegal to test computer driven cars. The rest of america should follow suit though the article says, " manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe." For the time being there not safe enough. though there are constant development being made to the driverless car. There are still to many hole in the ideal to make a safe apperance on the road.

one of the advancements is that the cars have "Traffic Jam Asstancet." the article say they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." If the driverless car cant handle a workzone or accident. Then it diffinitly can't handle roads with wondering children and dogs.

drivers get distracted while driving there self driven cars. they couldn't handle a driverless one.
