Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this as a response letter in response to the new policy you want to put on the students, changing the opportunity to be in sports with only a B GPA or higher. Most of the students think this is unfair, including myself. Here are the three reasons i heard the most among the students...

One reason is that some students try their hardest in class and could only obtain a C GPA average and it's not fair if you give those students a chance to thrive in sports and not to those with a lower score. Most students here want to be in cheer leading, basketball, baseball, flag football, etc. and if some students aren't even given a chance to even try any sports activities then they most likely wont ever again want to try something new.

Another good reason is, if a student is absent for a really specific reason, then they would have to do a lot of makeup work, depending on the teacher, and some teachers refuse to give makeup work and then grade it afterwards. Most teachers say if you weren't here you missed out, especially in P.E, if you missed a mile-running day, you can't make that up unless you come after school or before school and you have to ask your parents if they will be able to take you to make it up, and some parents can't just take off work to something as small as that.

The strongest reason I found among the students was, if for example a student is really good at baseball and the school refuses to take notice of his/her skills simply because of his/her grades, then you would have never know if that student would have been able to get a scholarship for that by a college, or be a sports star... all because of a principles new policy on sports vs. grades.

I hope you do not enforce this new policy TEACHER_NAME but all I can do on behalf of all the students is write you a letter, persuading you not to.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
