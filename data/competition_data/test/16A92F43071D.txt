Have you heard that some schools might require students to do an extracurricular activity? You may not completely agree with this idea because you can think of a lot of negative outcome. However, if you just read what I'm going to say, you might change your mind. I agree with students doing an extracurricular activity, because the students get to choose what they do, they can use it to get their energy out, and if the student has a disability they can still participate also!

First, the student will get to choose their activity, and every six to nine weeks they can change it. If they don't like the one they chose then they can change it to something they like to do. When a student picks an activity they'll most likely pick something that one of their friends are doing. Also, a lot of the students will be bored if they don't get to choose something they like. On the other hand, when the student changes their activity they can choose the activity again, the next six to nine weeks, if they liked it.

Secondly, when a student is sitting for a really long time, they tend to get tired or bored;therefore, they can do something like a sport to wake them up or to get their energy out. Have you ever sat for hours on end? If you have then you know what I'm talking about, but if you haven't sitting gets boring and you need something to do, so if a student is doing an activity they won't need to worry about getting bored or tired. Students might need the activity to get some exercise in too.

Also, students with disabilities can still participate in an activity. Not many students have a major disability;although, they may not be able to walk. However, here are some of the activities that they can participate in like, art, choir, computer technology, and a whole bunch more. Although, not a lot of things those students can do, at least they have a variety they can choose from. Another part is that if they're in a wheel chair, or crutches, they won't have to move around that much.

Lastly, there are many reasons to agree with extra curricular activities, but those were my reasons to agree. So, if you agree, you may be able to come up with some more positive things that the activities can could possibly benefit. If you think that extracurricular activities should be put into your school, just talk to your principal about making students do an extracurricular activity. So, in conclusion, the reasons why I agree with students doing an extracurricular activity, is because the students get to choose, they can get their energy out, and if the student has a disability they can still participate too!
