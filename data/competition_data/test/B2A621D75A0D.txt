To the Principal:

I think that in some way this is a good thing but also a bad thing. A good reason is that it will push students to strive for academic excellence. A bad reason might be that a person tries hard enough, but still does not have a B average. People who have a C average still should be able to play because sports will keep them out of trouble. Also, if you take sports or other activities from them, you take the thing that they most enjoy away from them.

So principal, I submit to you that if you change the policy, you will unhappy students and parents complaining to you. If a student is striving for the best they can do but still does not have a B average, they should be able to participate in sports or any other extra curricular activities. Teachers can report to you whether or not an athlete is really striving for a B average or more. If they do not meet these requirements on their progress reports, they should be able to practice but not play.

These are some specific reasons why this policy is a good idea but at the same time a bad one as well. If you keep the policy the same and students will try their best, every thing should work out at the school for parents and teachers alike for sports and other extra curricular activities. That is how I fell and most of the student body on this new grades for sports and other extra curricular activities. I believe that this will be a good balanced of effort and averages.
