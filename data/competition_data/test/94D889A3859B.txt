Dear principal,

I strongly agree with the new policy. Sports and grades are important, students will learn how to work together as a team and to think. I believe that the policy would do good for the students because it would keep there minds focused. So their grades would get higher, they could get into the sport they want if they want it that bad. The reason they are in school is to learn so that would get there heads straight. For example i had heard a student say that he will be a famous basketball player one day but he is failing school. How is he going to get into a good collage or university after high school if he is flailing?

Education is very important. But their are some people that think sports are more important. that's not true. Both are important because sports keep you in shape, help you work together as a team, keeps your mind focused, makes you think of strategies. And education helps you in life, get a really good job you would enjoy, helps your mind stay focused, a lot of things.

The students need to realize how very important school is. So that policy the principal has made is a good idea. To have a B grade average will keep that student that is really into sports focused in school and the sport.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
