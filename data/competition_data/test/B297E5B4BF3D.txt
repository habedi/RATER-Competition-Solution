Science. Scientific. Fact.

These are the words you should have going through your mind as you wonder about the Mars landform, found by NASA's

Viking 1; The face. The pharaoh. The man on Mars. However, there are some who...Wish to believe.

To these folks, it is also the face. The

Alien. Martian on mars. These, are the people who we call conspiracy theorists. Conspiracy theorists are nothing more than mere people who wish to emphasize something and twist it up to make it, of course, a conspiracy. These said theorists want to change the perspective and point of view via others, and themselves as well.

However, fact cannot be contained.

When it comes to the face on Mars, as previously explained, there is indeed, fact over opinion. In many aspects, not to mention. Landforms, shadows, and shading galore. In pictures, the face seems to contain basic details to give t the "person" type of vibe off. However, there is just one problem.

With the face being known as looking human, there are details still missing. Such as, the rest of the body. There would possibly be an outline of something more around the face, or where a body may be. We cannot go down and literally dig on Mars, thereore pictures were, or are the nex t big thing.

There is a lot of shadowing going around on Mars. The thick clouds, the different angles of rays of light shoning through.

This leads us to our final conclusion. The face is a landform. With the precise shadowing and the shape of some sort of facial stucture, who would know what to think. Blaming conspiracy theorists is not a preferred move, however, the theorists may forget to use fact. I believe, fact is that the face is a mere landform. An artwork of space.

Some, however, wish to believe. Maybe, we should let them.
