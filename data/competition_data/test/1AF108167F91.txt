The Facual Coding System enabling identification of human emotions.

I agree with an idea that it's valuable to use thi technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."This means that when a student is not feeling well at all the classroom computer could let the teacher know and and the teacher can find solutions to the student. This can help both a teacher and a student because the teacher can know when the student(s) is ready to learn and can contribute to the academic performance.

"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."This means that the classroom computer is something very important becase students can understand the lesson which is benefitial.

"The classroom computer could also read when students are stressed/no concetrating." The classroom computer can let the teacher help student get out of stressors. This is the moost important to students because can contribute to the future of student by identifying whoever needs help.

"Prolonged sadness for some students." The Classroom computer can help student in many ways, some student can't identify their feelings or emotions. Depression is something that can harm people mentally and some students including me don't we don't want other people/teacher know what's going on in ours life. So the classroom computer can identify us and notify the teacher which can help us get help.

Therefore the classroom computer is something to consider in schools or classrooms. It's helpful to both teacher and a student.
