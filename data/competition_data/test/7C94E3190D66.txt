Have you ever wanted to try something new while still having fun and making friends? Extracurricular activities are a great way to go! Extracurricular activities help you make friends, learn helpful skills in life, discover your passion, and make the school community better. I agree with the principals decision, every student should participate in extracurricular activities. I believe once given a chance, every student will find and love a certain extracurricular activity that speaks to them.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people, and make friends. When you join an extracurricular activity you meet new people who share the same interest as you. If you're socially awkward or shy extracurricular activities may seem like your worst nightmare. Fortunately, your shared interest will give you something to talk about with your peers that are there, and chances are, you're not the only new person participating. Making new friends can give you someone to talk to, they can make you smile more, and make your day better. Maybe you meet your friends that stay with you for the rest of your life during that activity, if you never try it, you'll never know.

Going to extracurricular activities can also teach you helpful skills in life. There are many different types of extracurricular activities, some you do only for fun, some you do to help your community, and some you do to learn new skills. If you've always thought about trying a certain activity, but you're not sure if you'll like it, extracurricular activities are a great way to go! There are so many different activities that you could try, many of them help you gain skills you'll use later in life. As an example I took Tech Ed, I was wary about it at first, but I had so much fun, and I learned many useful tools in life. I also took Home EC. which taught me how to cook and sew. I learned so much from both classes, and learned many skills from both of them that I will use later in life.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also help you discover your passion. Trying something new can be scary at first, but chances are, you'll find something you like. People discover their passion by trying new things. As your extracurricular activity you may choose to take Tech Ed. You find out that you really like seeing how things are put together, and building things, so you decide to become an engineer or architect when your older. If you never tried Tech Ed you never would have known that you want to become an engineer, and you would have never discovered your love for building things. By participating in new things you have the chance to discover your passion, what you want to do for the rest of your life.

Participating in extracurricular activities not only helps you, but also the school you go to, and your community. Every activity you do helps the school community in someway, so you're not only helping yourself, you're also helping the school community become better. Whether you're picking up trash, tutoring younger students, or you're part of the school basketball team, they all help the school become better. By helping the school, you are ensuring that your legacy lives on, you are ensuring that your school community is the best it can be, for you, for your friends, and for those that come after you.

I agree with the principals decision that every student should participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity. Students gain so much from participating in extracurricular activities. They make new friends, learn skills that they will use later in life, discover their passion, and make their community a better place. I want to make every students middle and high school years the best that they can be. By participating in extracurricular activities, I believe they will be one step closer to achieving that.
