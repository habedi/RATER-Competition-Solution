Every student should have the chance to take part in something where they may not only learn but they can develop new friendships at the same time. In my opinion I agree that students should partake in an extracurricular activity. There are many reasons a student should be apart of an extracurricular. They have many options and could learn many new things. This could also make a large impact within the school. This could also be a good experience for the students to try.

There are many options of extracurricular activities. Students have the option of trying a new sport as there extracurricular. There are many different sports they can do such as baseball, soccer, basketball, and golf. By choosing a sport students are provided with exercise and physical activity. This would help keep students healthy and active. Students may also select a club. Just like sports there are many choices by selecting a club such as yearbook, debate, chess, and book club. Although these may not be very active they still they still allow students to challenge themselves in many ways. Some students may choose a more school involved club such as Deca, Campus, student council, and if the students grade meet the standard they may also join National Honors Society. These clubs allow students to be more involved within their schools. Students get a chance to be apart of making decisions for the school and their future. Joining a club like these students also learn new skills that could really help them in the future. By having many options it provides students a chance to make there own decisions.

Students will learn new skills and meet new people. Students will be able to develop new friendships and teamwork skills. In each activity students are working with other students as a team. Thus will allow students to build up confidence while working with others. They will also work with their fellow students regularly so they will get the chance to really get to know one an other. The students may also acquire time management skills. By having an extracurricular activity students will have to balance school along with their extracurricular activity. Students could choose to make a schedule or arrange enough time each day to do their school work along with the work from their extracurricular activity. Students will be taking on a lot of work so students should also set aside some time to relax this way they have time to reset and be ready to work. Students will also learn to take charge among their fellow students. They will develop courage among their team and club mates. This will allow them to feel relaxed while speaking in front of others. Students can take away a lot of new skills and bonds by having an extracurricular.

This may also benefit the school in many different ways. This would raise student moral. Student being involved in an activity that is fun and exciting to them could help make students attitude better. This would make for a better learning environment for students and teachers. This would also raise student involvement in schools. Students will be more aware of what is going on within their schools. They will have more interest in what is going on and may even want to take part in what is going on. Since the students will have developed time management skills students will be more prepared and ready for class. Students could show more of an interest in their school work. They may develop more of a strive to do well in school. This will allow teachers to try new activities and projects in their classes. By having students participate in an extracurricular activity it would make the school an overall better learning environment.

I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it would benefit the students and schools in many different ways. The students have many different options for an extracurricular such as sports or clubs. They will make new friends and gain new skills. This would also be an overall benefit towards the schools. This would be a great plan for the schools to implement for the students and it would not take long to make this plan active.
