I agree with this decision. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe this because, students can have more fun, students can help the school, and students can have a better idea about what job they might want in the future.

Students are always in their classrooms learning and working. With an extracurricular activity apart of their schedule, students can have more fun at school! Students can enjoy themselves by participating in an extracurricular activity. It would be like having a break from their usual schedule.

Depending on what kind of extracurricular activity the student is involved in, students can help out with school fundraisers, donations, or the weekly school news. They can start fundraisers for the school by setting up advertisements. Students can do this by making posters or setting up fund raisingÂ websites. Students can also create short videos or newspapers to inform other students about certain events that will take place during the school weeks. Students can join school clubs to help with donations as well.

By participating in an extracurricular activity, a student can really start thinking about what kind of career they might want in the future. For example, if a student decides to play for the Prince George baseball team as an extracurricular activity, then he or she may want to become a professional baseball player. Students may also enjoy working on the school yearbook. By working on the school yearbook, they may consider becoming a photographer for their career. Therefore, having an extracurricular activity can make it easier for students to decide on a job they might want for their future.

In conclusion, students can have lots of fun when having an extracurricular activity to participate in. They can also help out the school with fundraisers, donations, or even school news. Extracurricular activities can really help students think of a future career. That is why I believe students must participate in an at least one extracurricular activity.
