Some schools require kids to do something school based over the summer, I don't agree with that at all. Kids use summer break as a vaction from all things school related. If they do make the kids do it then I think it should be student-designed. The reason being is, if you're going to take the students summer break then at least let them do what they want to do. If the things they choose to do is school-realatable than they should get to do it.

A summer break is a kids time to have fun. It's not meant for more things school, it mean that school needs to be as far as possible. Kids should be out playing with their friends, not stuck doing something school realated. Kids should never be forced to do something that they don't want to do. Me, personally I would never take a kids summer break away from them.

It shoud definently be student-designed. One, Adults don't know what us kids like to do. They are just going to merge all grades and expect all of us to get along. Kids should always have a say in what they are going to do. Some parents just make plans for their kids. That is not be the way kids should be treated.

But in my opinion, kids should never have their summer break taken. Also if you make the students do something over summer break than the teachers are going ot have to run it. Then that takes away from everybody, then everybody gets mad. Lastly, no one is going to run it. Which leaves the school in debt because their plan didn't go as planned.

In conclusion, No kids should not have their summer breaks taken away from them. Because kids use summer break as a time away fro school. But, if they do make the kids do this, then it should be kid-designed. If the teachers design it than it won't be as fun for the kids.Â
