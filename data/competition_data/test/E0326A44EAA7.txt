Benefits of Distance Learning?

While technology is increasing as well as improving throughout school systems, it has given students more opportunities to have classes outside of school. Although this is not a bad thing, there are not many good outcomes to students working outside of the school environment. Students would have no behavioral skills, social skills, or work ethic.

In school, students learn how to behave in public and around others. However, students taking online courses will be in the comfort of their own home and their demeanor will not change. Due to the fact that they are at home, the only way they can receive any form of discipline is from their parents. Students will not receive the discipline that schools give which teach students how to act around other people as well as out in public. Students need to be taught code switching, to learn what behavior is right and wrong. Schools are one of the most important places to learn behavioral discipline.

Having online courses for school would not give students the opportunity to become social and interactive with others. Throughout a students' life, elementary through high school, they are learning social skills as well as interacting with other students. Without being around others to interact with, they will lack skills that will be needed for the rest of their lives. Having social skills will help them in the work force. To be able to have a job, students will have to speak to customers, coworkers, and bosses. Without social skills, they will not be prepared for life outside of school as well as talking with new people. Online schools do not give them the opportunity to be able to communicate with others and have the skills needed to survive as an adult.

It is important for students to have a schedule and due dates for work. This creates good work ethic and time management skills. Having classes outside of school makes for bad student work ethic and most importantly, laziness. Although online schools have due dates and schedules, students will not take it as seriously as they would in school. Students will not only work at their own pace but, they will do their work when they feel like working. Online school gives students freedom to do what they want, when they want. Therefore, they will continue to work this way and will not have any kind of good work ethic.

As online schools are increasing through out school systems and classrooms, it is not beneficial to students.

Not having students in a school will not give them all the requirements they will need for prepare them for their adult lives. Students need to be able to work well with others, have good work ethic, and be able to code switch when needed.
