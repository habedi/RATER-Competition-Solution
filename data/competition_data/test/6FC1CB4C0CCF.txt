Let's see can students benefit from learning at home then attending a regular school.

Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home either online or video chatting. In my opinion many students think that learning at home is easier and that they'll focus on school more. Students think that they'll have less distraction at home then in school,they get there work done,and be to classes on time. I support both issues of attending regular school or online school they have there advantages and disadvantages.

Attending classes at school is more beneficial because you have a teacher right in front to help you understand and keep you focus in your classes. You also have friends that you can talk to and discuss you answers with your classmates share ideas and answers you have for any class work you need to turn in. If you have any special need going to a school is much better because they will help you learn and will help you with anything you struggling with,also they can give you classwork to understand each class your having trouble in. You wont miss out on any school events if your in high school youll enjoy going to prom or homecoming going to any sport games etc. Attending school is much more fun you get to interact with other students learn about they life and even other things you want to know about them.

Why i disagree with online or video conferencing classes, is because many students think that having online classes they have a right to do whatever they want, dont get me wrong they do but they also have a schedule of what time there classes start they might have an option to wake up at anytime. But now matter if you have different options or more time to do what you want to,you have to attend your class everyday. having online classes could be a good use if your going on a vacation or are sick for any good reason then you will have the need to use an online system that will help you catch up on anything you could need will miss. You could be able to graduate on time or even earlier if you complete all your courses.

Classes at school can be better taught and have technology available to use. Students may think that not going to school thinking that it wont effect there school performance which is not true because you can de changed to online school which some students will regret some won't. some people dont make a smart choice and chose whats gonna make it harder for them to learning and understand school also then dont see what they really want in life they just take "an easy" way out of everything.

In conclusion,can students benefit from learning at home then attending a regular school. I support the people who attend school and not online classes because they have different ways of learning new things and interacting with new people. Online school students could have trouble pay and even understanding time and might have limited time of help they could use. I find attending school easy and faster to learn new ways of every other thing.
