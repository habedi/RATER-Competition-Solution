Whether students and teachers like it or not, some schools require students to still learn over their summer breaks. One way that these students have to learn is through projects. These projects should be teacher-designed instead of student designed for many different reasons. Although students can be smart, they are not experts on the field that the project would be based on, so for a better chance of more accurate learning, students should leave the project designing for their teachers. Teachers are also the ones who create the lesson plans, so they know what students need to know for the course, making them better candidates for creating the projects than students are. Lastly, student-designed projects can be harder to grade than teacher-designed projects. For these reasons, students should not be forced to create summer projects for their peers; the job of being a teacher should be left for the teachers.

Not every single student in every single class is at the mastery level of a topic. Kids who have a 99% over all for the class still do not know everything that their is to know about a specific subject. Teachers on the other hand go to school for the subject they want to teach and teach the same class repeatedly. This lets them specialize in what they teach and have constant reminders about how to do what needs to be done for the subject. These years of experience that teachers have in their field should not be wasted by letting students design projects. Students often make mistakes, and other students should not have to learn how to do these mistakes simply because a student designed a project rather than the teacher, a professional in the field.

Students are not the ones who design and follow lesson plans for their academic courses. Teachers are the ones who make the lesson plans and know which materials students are responsible for knowing and not knowing as well. Since these teachers know what students need to learn and the point of these summer projects is simply for learning, this is another reason why students should not be designing these projects. Making a students who does not know the entire course layout of the class or the time period in which each subject in the class needs to be learned makes this task to heavy to put only on students. Students who have not created an entire lesson plan based on what needs to be taught and learned throughout the year should not be forced to then come up with a summer based project to teach their peers, when they do not even know what needs to be taught in what specific time period.

Finally, student-made projects could have more potential grading complications that teacher-made projects. Students still not fully having mastered the subject if left to grade might incorrectly mark another students project since they do not fully understand the subject themselves. Also if a student is the one responsible for grading, they may overlook or even correct their friends projects simply to help them get a better grade or to not feel the guilt that comes with marking off something of you friend's work. On the other hand, if teachers are the ones grading student-designed projects, there is the chance that teachers will not understand the student's rubric that they created or there is even a chance that the teachers will not even understand what the students are hoping to accomplish through the project(s) that they have created. To keep grading accurate and fair, teachers should be the ones to both design and grade these summer projects.

There are too many complications that come with making students design projects for their peers. Students are not experts on the subjects, so making them create projects over professionals in the subject is not fair to the students or their peers who need these summer projects to learn from. These students are also not the ones who make lesson plans, so they do not know what should be taught in what amount of time. Lastly, for grading fairness, it is better to have teachers be the ones to design and grade these summer projects. Although the idea of letting students create these projects for their peers can be fun and help with their learning of the subject, there are too many other avoidable complications that can be solved by leaving teachers to be the ones in charge of these projects. Teachers should be the ones doing the jobs of teaching, not students.
