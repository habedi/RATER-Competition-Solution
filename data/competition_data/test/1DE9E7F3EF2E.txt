Steve, I believe that the figure we see now is not a face created by aliens, I merly believe it is a landform. In 1976 when we found the figure I would've agreed with you but in 2001, technology was better and it looks like a natural landform. I think that it was just the tectonic plates had moved and made the surface push up. That's what I believe Steve.

On April 8, 2001 what the photo actually looked like was a butte or a mesa-landform. Garvin stated, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." In my opinion it reminds me of a hill or a small mountain. Steve even in 1998 I would've agreed with you but as I look at the photo of 2001, I just don't see a face.

Steve as I stated before, I just don't believe that the figure is a face. I just think that it is a natural landform. So think about my opinion Steve.
