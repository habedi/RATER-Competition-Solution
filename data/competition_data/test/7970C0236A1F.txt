Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard about what you are trying to get students to do "community service". I do think this a good idea and i want this to happen but there are some students that might not even care about this and not follow along with this plan. I would think it would be better to form a group at school and let students who would want to help with this process. Some students don't have the time to go help, even if you forced them to help out. Plenty of students have after school activity's that they cant miss out on. I do agree with you 100% but i don't think it will work a bunch if we just made kids do it. Lets just try at the beginning of this process to make a club at school for the people that are interested and will participate with all their effort on community service and if they like it well maybe they can make a speech of how great it if to help out in community service. I would really want some kids that are not involved in a lot of activities through out the school year and that are not doing good in their grades, because i think it would help them out to figure what's out there in this big world and it would also probably help them get their grades up. If you ever need help in something with activities like these i will always be here to help with SCHOOL_NAME

.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
