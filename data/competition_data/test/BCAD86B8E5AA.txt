Phones and Driving Essay

All around the world people are constantly trying to decrease safety risks. Driving has become one of those risks to safety. Since cellular phones have grown to be popular. People often use them everywhere and in their car is no exception. At first this was great. You could be on a work call while you were on your way home. Or you could be checking to see if anyone else wanted food where you were eating at. Although this has brought much convenience, utility and entertainment. It also has brought great risk to safety while driving. Drivers become distracted and make more mistakes than usual. Causing more accidents. There is a big discussion over whether you should be able to use your phone while driving or not. I believe that phones should not be allowed to be used in cars.

One reason that cell phones shouldn't be allowed is simply because you can last the car ride without using it. With the exception of an emergency of course. If something is important than you can pull over and make a call while getting gas or something. And everyone would be better off paying less car insurance. Also, if you have kids and display that you don't value safety, then they may follow and do the same and even worse.

Another reason is that it puts everyone at risk including themselves. If everyone was on their phone while driving. We would probably have close to double the amount of accidents. Just for a little convenience. Studies show that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol.

Humans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles, making the likelihood of seeing a pedestrian much less than that of a car. And hitting a ton car is different than hitting a pedestrian. The pedestrian would likely die if you were going fast enough.

In conclusion, simply because the downsides outweigh the upsides. You should not be able to go on your phone while driving. Because of the distraction that it causes. ANd its impact on our awareness of our surroundings while driving. It's a safety risk and for the most part only has downsides. From hitting cars to hitting pedestrians, the risk is not worth it as it puts many lives at risk.
