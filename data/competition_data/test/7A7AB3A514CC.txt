The ship was going back to the main land and we had just gone threw a bad storm,luckily not many had gotten hurt. I walked back to the to the other man who having a boxing match. "So, what are you doing when we get back on land?"Don asked. "I'll hopfully convince some young men to join the program. Last time I didn't get lucky."I told him. "Get ready cause we are almost hitting land." Don told me.

I got of the boat and smelled the fresh air of New York. I had rented a home their to live in while I got some men to participate in the program. I put my stuff in the house, took my keys, got in the car, and rode of into the city.

Once I got there i started to walk around and found a group of men by an abandon building.

"Hello there I would like to talk to you about a program called the Seagoing Cowboys-" The boys interupted me and started to laugh.

"Wow there we aren't to do some silly Cowboy thing. What are we going to go riding aroung town on ponies?"one boy said. All the others started to laugh while the boy started jumping around yelling "he ha".

"This is a serous matter and I would like you boys to listen."Luke said frusterated.

"Whatever."the boy said rolling his eyes.

"After WW ll many countries in Europe were left destruction cause of the war. So 44 nations joined together and created UNRRA who hired "Seagoing Cowboys". Seagoing Cowboys took care of animals that were shipped overseas. It isn't only that it's also an opportunity for you to go out and see how other countries work. I think you people might like it yourself."I said but none of the boys seemed interested.

"No thanks."they said and walked away. Except one boy.

"Uh, can you tell me more about this program you are talking of?"He asked with wide eyes seeking more information.

"Ok well I went to this one place where I......"I told him more and more about how exicting it was. I later learned the boy's name was Billy and Billy was the first one who sighned up.

The next week me and Billy looked and looked through the city to find any other young men who wanted to join. We only found ten. Later that week I called Don and asked him where he was at.

"I'm somewhere near you."He said.

"What do you mean?"I asked then I heard a knock on the door, "Sorry I'm gonna have to talk later someones at the door." But it didnt matter cause he had already hung up.

I opened the door and there was Don. "How did you get here so fast and still call me I mean there is no such thing has phones that aren't conected to walls! Or are there?"I wondered.

"Nah could never happen," Don said, "I'll rented the house next door."

"What really?!"

"Yep I'm here to help."

"Great cause i need alot."I said.

The next day Don and I met up with Billy.

"Billy this is Don." I said.

"Don this is Billy."

"Ready Billy."Don said.

"Sure am."He responeded.

That whole week we worked really hard to get people to join the program. Two months later and we were already nearly 200 hundred people."Ok tomorrow I'm suposed to turn in the forms with all the names."I said. "Where do we turn all of them in?"Billy asked while eating bannna. "New Jeresy.'I told them. "Here we go!"I said.
