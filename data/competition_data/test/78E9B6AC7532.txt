Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that all students should have to do community service. Some kids feel that not doing it takes to much time, i disagree. we should do like the high schools do it, it should be mandatory. Giving back to my community is like helping someone that cant help themselves. There are a lot of students that do the things they do, its part of a grade and if you don't do that then that's on you. i feel strongly that we all need to do this. Help the community help your town do better. The government are laying people of because there's no money and the bigger the problem the more people you would need to get the job done. Teach the kids why its we should have a time in school where the teachers tell us how to do stuff. I would want to get those kids that do anything and to get them working. One day i didn't want to work and i gave my teacher attuide and i laughed in this face. I told him that i didn't want to work he toke me outside and said if your not going to work in the classroom then your going to work outside, i picked up trash for a full half an hour i sure did not like that. tell the student body that if they don't do this there not helping you and there helping the community. You kids say i don't care and i don't need this well when your looking for a job later in your life and cant find one because you couldn't take the time to do a simple task then i don't know what to tell you. What i'm getting at here is that given an oppurtuniy and still don't chose to take then that's such a shame. Make sure what there missing out on. its not hurting anyone but themselves and knowing that as a student why would you still not take the chance to do something unique and amazing.
