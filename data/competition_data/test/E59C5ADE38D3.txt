Dear Principal,

I have heard from rumor in the school that you are thinking of requiring at least a B average so kids can Join sports and Activities. Well I think you shouldn't do it, I know kids aren't paying attention in class but atleast they have something to work hard for. Now if you do take away the privilege of Joining clubs with an B average then what will these kids look forward to when coming to school? Now think about it while i tell why shouldn't make clubs and Activities for B average and Higher students.

As we go into our school you out of all people will notice that clubs partake in our school. Now what kind of a school do you think this will be if there weren't any clubs or activities. What will the students look forward to? I know I would certainly be mad especially since Most of the students here have a C average. From hearing this well most of the kids would probably boycott and rebel against this, to be honest Sir I would too I would also be infuriated knowing that i can't do the thing that i love so much just because i have a grade lower than what i need to be in order to be in a club.

Besides Sir don't you think we students try to do good in classes just to stay in our clubs it is because we love where we are now in our clubs. I certainly don't know what i would do without doing the thing that i love which is band. Ever since i came to school band has been such a big deal for me since almost all our electives have been taken away, now all we have are just Art, Band and Spanish this is what worries me the most we either loose our electives to the county or to you sir.

I strongly recommend you read my letter and really take your time in thinking about this, I not saying to do for me sir but for the students here that want to a safe and better place to learn as this school says. Trust me sir as i say that i would anything for band i grew being a musician and i love please sir i only wish you can atleast read and think what if
