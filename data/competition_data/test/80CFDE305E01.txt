Driverless cars is a really bad idea. There are so many outcomes that could happen when the car is drving itself. It could malfunction and crash. The driver might not be paying attention and when they do have to take over, they don't and crash. And lastly there would be many people losing lots of money from sueings because people wouldnt know who was at fault, the driver or the manufacturer.

There are some positives to the driverless cars. For example people who just "have" to text can finally do that and when needed to drive can surely put there phone down for five minutesto help the car out. Also, less use of gas will help our world out with global warming, and the decrease of fossil fuels in the world. Finally, there would be a decrease in crashes across the nation, but many would not know who to blame.

Driverless cars should not be aloud for may differnet reasons. First, if the driver is tired and is not doing anything but watching the road waiting for it to say for them to take over, they could fall alseep and not see the warning sign. Second, It would have possiblely more drunk driving accindents, becuase they would think the car would just take them home insted of them having to worry about it.

Driverless cars are a bad thing and should not become a thing in the U.S. They wouldd lead to many dissagreements in court, people would take advantage of them. Lastly, people would dissrespect he car and what has been given to them from technology and think it is just a toy now!
