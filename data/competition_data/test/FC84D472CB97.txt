I agree because some students are not as active as other students and get left out of things and that will make you sad and fell well left out. It is important to make sure you are well rounded. So you can achieve in life. But here is the catch you will be so caught up in youre club you wont have time to get on youre electronic devises and when you get home you will have so much to talk about .Instead of you coming home and youre parents asking you how school was now you would usely reply as school was boring i didnt have any fun. But if you joined a club and you come home and youre parents ask how school was youre reply is it was great i learned so many new thing for example you say hey mom did you know a funny bone is not really a bone it is just a nerve? or say hey dad guess what i did today! and youre dad replies what did you do today? you will say i made three touchdowns! or say hey mom guess what mom? she replies i hit a home run in softball today you could hear the ball hit my bat it made a really big BOOM! and everyone on my team wanted to be friends with me and they put me on the list for the first batter to go up to the plate. Youre parents will be so proud that they would shed a tear even for the parents who you never seen cry before. Youre parents would tell all youre family members and they say good job are i didnt know that. Are that's my girl or boy there are lots of benefits of going a club. Also you could make friends with people you dont know and you will be so informed and have so much to talk about and be exited about. That is why you should agree with our principle. If i did not convince here is why you should you be more happy in life and it helps improve you in life and you have so much fun that you well forget all youre worries because you have so much fun in life. Now go and live youre life by agreeing with are principle go team agree.
