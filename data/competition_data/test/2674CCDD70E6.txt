Dear principal, when you said that you think that only students with a B average grade should be allowed to participate in after school sports I strongly disagree with you. I think that students should be allowed to participate in after school activity's if they have a C average as long as you talk to their teachers to make certain they are trying their hardest in their classes. If the aren't turning in their homework and aren't precipitating in class and aren't respecting the students around them and do poorly on tests and quizzes because they just aren't trying and doing their best then I don't think they should be allowed to participate in any after school activity's ,but if they are doing their homework on a regular basis and participate in class and actually try during class, even if they are or aren't doing good on tests and quizzes I think they should still be allowed to participate in after school activity's because of the fact that they are indeed trying their hardest and showing that they are doing their best effort.

If I were you I would base it on the individual student to find out what ,and how they are feeling about this issue. If it were me I might even have the individual student talk to you and their teachers, to determine weather or not they try hard in class do their homework participate and follow directions are respectful of their peers and teachers and know what is expected of them.
