Time is running out. You have a big decision to make that would effect everyone. Your principal has asked you if it's all right to make everyone do an extracurricular activity. Do you agree or disagree? I would agree because of the fun things you can do and it helps others to communicate face to face.

Think of all the fun things you can do if you had to do an extracurricular activity. Sports, yearbook, theater, and all the different type of clubs you can do. Now think of all the fun things you can do if you had no extracurricular activity to do and being a bump on a log. Sitting there and doing nothing. Extracurricular activities brings an extra kick to your day and gives you some time to learn communication skills.

Extracurricular grants you the responsibility to communicate with others. While doing a club you like you may discover someone who likes the same club. It helps build friendship and creates new friends. This also makes you meet more people who you might have never seen in your life. So extracurricular helps in communication.

So let's think about it. Extracurricular activities can bring fun things like sports or yearbook or fun clubs. It also help's make new friends and lets you meet people you never seen before. It also lets you hangout with old friends. So what you think. Do you say yes or no to your principal?
