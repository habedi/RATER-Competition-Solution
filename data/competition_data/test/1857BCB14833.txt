Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, because by exploring Venus, humans can learn more about the makeup of Earth, they can learn about the origins of Earth, and it will give them a reason to develop new technology.

Firstly, Venus is a worthy pursuit because by exploring Venus, humans can learn more about the physical makeup of Earth. The article states that Venus is, "...Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size." With Venus being this similar to Earth, the features on Venus can give a refrence to features on Earth, acting as a guide to what is normal on other planets in the Solar System. By comparing those features to ones found on Earth, scientists can have a better understanding of what happens on the planets, and on Earth, and why these things happen. This being said, Venus can help humans better understand Earth because the planets are very similar.

Second, Venus is a worthy pursuit because by exploring Venus, humans can learn more about the origins of Earth. The article states that, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." Venus also has many rocklike structures similar to those found on Earth. This information suggests that Venus could have formed similarly to the way Earth did. Since Venus used to essentually be another version of what Earth is today, the observation of features there are crucial to see if humans are on the right track with how they think Earth was formed. Therefore, by exploring Venus, humans can use details found there to decide how Venus was formed, and by comparing them to Earthly details, can come to a conclusion on how Earth may have been formed long ago.

Finally, Venus is a worthy pursuit because by exploring Venus, humans have a reason to develop new technologies. According to the article, "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions." The harsh environment of Venus can destroy a computer with ease. This is why the longest a proble has ever survived on Venus was just a few hours. Since computers are so extremely valuble when it comes to performing a function such as space travel, they need to be sturdy enough to survive the harsh conditions of other planets. Therefore, new technology must be created in order to make a Venus exploration possible. Also, by successfully creating a technology that is durable enough, that technology can be used in other projects, such as an Earth exploration, or somthing that can better serve the public.

In conclusion, Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, because by exploring Venus, humans can learn more about the makeup of Earth, they can learn about the origins of Earth, and it will give them a reason to develop new technology.
