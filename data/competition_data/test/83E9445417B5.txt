The article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" is probably the best story ever! The facial Action Coding System is a really great thing to do when you're at school or work. I think that it's cool that just scanning someones face can help you know what their real emotions are.

The thing I like most about the article is that it says "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." I love how Dr. Huang could tell what Mona Lisa's emotions were by looking through a screen called Facial Action Coding System.

In paragraph three, it tells you that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. It scans the 44 major muscles in the model like human muscles.

He founded out that there are 6 facial expressions a person can have like, happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness. I love how it can tell if your are making a fake smile or real smile by looking at your mouth. Usually if you're actually happy, your cheeks and eyebrows raise up and if you weren't smiling real then your lips wouldn't go up they would just move sideways and it wouldn't go up.
