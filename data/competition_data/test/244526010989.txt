In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. the author supports this claim by using logos to give facts and numbers to the readers like, te average temperatures for venus are 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater then earths atmospheric pressure. the author also gives the readers pathos to show use what the profesionals, for example the National Aeronautics and Space Adiministration or for short NASA has one compelling idea for sending humans to venus and thats to study the plants resources and gasses but a big problem with that is if we did send humans there, they could only hover above the atmosphere like a plane because of how hot the ground and because it would be impossible for humans to breath due to 97 percant of Venus atmosphere is carbon dioxide that srounds venus, plus the clouds on Venus are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. addition to the problems with exploring Venus is that theres a ton of erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting storms. if venus is so inhospitable then why are scientist and the author so deteminded to visit venus? Astronomers are so fascinated by Venus because it may once have been like are earth with oceans and various life forms of life on venus. in short if vensu was once so much like are earth then what happened to it and thats what researchers and scientists would like to know, because whatever caused that to happen could happen to earth as well.
