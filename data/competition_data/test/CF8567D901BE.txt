Dear Principal,

I think that it would be a bad idea to have phones in school during lunch periods and free time. I think this because that is probably the way we get gossip around, and we all know that gossip is bad in school. The bad thing about being allowed to have phones in school is that students will take them out during class and text. That will be a distraction for not only the student, but everyone around. The good thing about having phones in school is that if there is an emergency at home, you will have your phone on your side. Being able to have phones during free time would be fun. We would not have to yell across the room to someone, we can just call the person. But then again, that would probably be the time that people would be spreading around gossip and rumors.

We all still use phones in school, even though we are not suppose to. We get them taken away, and when our parents find out, there is usually consequences at home. I hope you know now that having phones in school can be both a bad thing and a good thing, but I will stick with it being a bad idea.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
