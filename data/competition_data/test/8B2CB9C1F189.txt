Ever think of just staying home one day and not deal with school for once, well you can. Some school offer learning distance to attend classes from home, by online or a video conferencing. This is a good thing to students if they have health problems, can get a better sleeping schedule, and students will feel safer at home then school. But some people will say that staying home will make them lazier and not do the work, but that's not the case here. We want the students to focus on their goal and if this is the way then let it be.

There are a lot of kids that have health problem that need to be check every couple of hours or need to take pills every couple of hours a day, if not check they could be in trouble and send to the hostile. At home the parents can help them to remember to take there pills or do their daily check up at home or to the doctor office. Appointments is another problem that we all face and hate. There are times when you can't get the time you want, so you will not miss any school hours, that doesn't work all the time. But when you are taking online classes you don't need to worry about that, you can just take the class later that day or take your computer to the appointment since they take forever to finish and work on it there.

Sleep is very important to health, because it will make you feel ready to do stuff and help you focus on your work better. When you tell your kids to go to bed or your kids are old enough to go to bed all by them self, half the time they don't go to sleep right away. They might be on their phone all night or they have a sleeping problem that takes time to fall asleep. When this happens they don't want to get up in the morning, late or miss to the school bus and fall asleep in class. Taking online classes from home will let you pick the time you want to do the classes, so that you will have energy to finish them easier and not past out ever second of the day.

What is the most important thing in the world, yourself, your life, your kids, or family? It can be anything, but when you are a mother or father your kids safely is more important then your own. School should be a fun time, learning cool stuff you didn't even know about and a safe place to feel comfortable of being yourself, not being scared to go to school because another kid is bullying you, or a teacher is sexual to you. Parents will do anything to protect their kids. So when your kid is not feeling safe in school, the best thing the parent or kid will think about is take online school, if the problem at school is too much to deal with. They will feel more clam, comfortable and safer taking the online classes at home.

Therefore, those are the reasons why online classes are benefit for people that are too sick to go to school, a better sleeping schedule and most importantly being safe.
