Some schools believe in summer projects, the purpose of these projects are to assure that students continue to learn during summer break. Classes should be challenged to design their own project, this will challenge the student to design a complex project that is guaranteed to stay a topic of interest. Students should poses a checklist that details what the project needs. Teachers can provide examples for the class to reference if they become puzzled on a part of their task. Upon completion the teacher would receive an email verifying that the student finished the task.

Say if the project is for history the teacher can choose the time period they want and the student will find a topic. For example the teacher wants the project to be in the 2000's, the student could then choose to write about wars in the Middle-East. Therefore the topic is relevant to what the teacher wants and the student is interested in his or her research. The person working on the task can write about why the war happened, who started the war, and when the war ended. After the student finishes, the work will be emailed to the history teacher and would be graded.

If a teacher dictated the project the student would not have much interest in the work. The student would lose interest and stop working on it or would score low on the work. Loss of interest may result in the student not learning anything over summer. If someone holds interest in a subject they will retain the information they researched, and can possible continue to understand and research that object or subject. Which would result in learning something new over summer break.

Some teachers might say why give the student control on the project? Well if a student controlled their work they would be able to let their imagination flow, allowing them to discover their personality and learn about how they think and work best. The student would most likely choose something they want to learn more about. They can also choose something that appeals to their interests. For someone to learn something they must choose what appeals to them and build knowledge through research. That is why a student should be able to choose their summer project and not be told what to do work on.

Some students are required to do school projects over summer. Schools say it benefits the student and expands their knowledge. Schools should let the students choose and design their project. Student choice would assure that they learn something new over summer break. Teachers should provide examples and checklist to help the student work and continue to learn over the course of summer break.
