Have you ever just wanted to learn but never step foot inside a school?, Some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend school from home through online or video conferencing. I think students wont be getting any benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students learn more if they go to class, they will get one on one help with a teacher so that the teacher can help the student who is struggling by seeing how well he is doing on the subject and, I believe verbal interaction face to face is better than through a computer or tablet.

Students need education to be able to graduate and pursue a carrer they are interseted in, but some students are taking online classes because they are tired of going to school but I think that learning by going to school and into classes is better because u get to interact with the teacher and she will interact with you too and help you out on what you dont understand. alot of students have trouble with some subjects staying at home behind a computer doesn't help out when your stuck.

Teachers help students on a daily basishelping students in the classroom and teaching at the same time. students who do online learning do not have the same benefit as the ones who go to school. the ones that go to school can understand more of the subject than the one with distance learning because he cannot asks question like a normal kid in school would do he would have to do something else than just ask the teacher for help. Teachers also explain everything more clearly than the computer would.

Verbal interaction face to face is better than listening to somone speak through the computer. sometimes you can't really understand what they are saying in the comuputer because it is an automated voice talking to you. Online learning isn't good because you will need internet for you to be able to use it, and if the power goes out the computer wont be able to talk or show the screen.

This is why I think online learning isn't as good as actually attending school with real teachers and classmates. Some students to this point are stil doing online learning because they have a job and dont have time to come to school and learn. Most students who use online learning is because you can choose what time you want to study because most of them have jobs and cant study at a regular school.
