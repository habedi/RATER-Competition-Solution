How werid would it be to go to another planet just like Earth? Well in the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author goes into great detail of how NASA is trying to make that thought possible. Even though this idea of visting another planet is somewhat dangerous, the author seems to believe that we as a human species should expand our minds to more imagination and innovation.

In the article, the author descibes Venus as Earth's twin. Scientists have said that Venus once could have had many oceans,mountains,and even life just like we do here on Earth. Even though Venus is right next door to us, we still have not been able to send any man to Venus. The article supports this by stating that Venus has very dangerous temperatures of 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. The author states in the article, "Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study,despite its proximity to us."

The author then goes into detail of how we can avoid all of those obsticles by explaning a few ideas that NASA has came up with when it comes to visting our twin planet. The article states that NASA is working on a ship to hover over the surface of Venus. Of course, the ship would hover far away from all of the dangerous temperatures and atmospheric pressures near it's surface. The author also states that NASA is thinking back to a form of old technology called mechanocal computers that would be very hard to melt and destroy by Venus's harsh temperatures.

Through all of the doubts and crazy things humans would have to encounter, the author still holds hope that someday we as a human species can expand our limitations. At the very end of the article the author states,"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
