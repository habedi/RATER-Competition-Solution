Have you ever heard of "The face on Mars?" If so, what is your opinion or theory about it? Do you think it is an ancient body part , or made by aliens? I am going to share my theory with you using actual evidence.

First of all, if the face were some kind of artifact, NASA would benefit from it, and would make a lot of money off of it. If it were a human being at once where would that human get food or water? Space has zero gravity so all of their water would automatically freeze, and there is also no oxygen so where would the food grow, or develope without it? In paragraph 10, it states that after taking 2 photos already (which they didn't notice anything odd about), accusations got so crazy that they had to take a third and still saw nothing unusual!

In paragraph 1-2, it explains how NASA figured the figure was "just another Martian mesa" (which, by the way happens to be very common in the region of Cydonia.

If NASA had no explanation, or any idea of what it was I understand that people would throw out wild and crazy accusations, but however in paragraph 3, the textual evidence suggests that the "eyes and nose" part of the figure was an illousion from shadows, which is a reasonable or understandable accusation.

Plus, lets face it media hypes everything up , and over exaggerates constantly. As said in paragraph 5, "the face of Mars" showed in a Hollywood film, books/magazines, radiotalk shows, etc. People with no knowledge of space (such as a movie director) has no room to come up with accusations.

My conclousion, is that the figure is a natural landform, and that people need to stop making things sound more extraordinary then they really are.
