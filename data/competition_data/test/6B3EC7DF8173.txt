Have you heard of the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System they use it to read peoples emotion? Well there is and it to be a great invention because the device checks all of your facial bones. That means after doing that they can really find out what your emotions are like they used on the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. However, is it really something you can use in a classroom full of students? Yes, because the teacher will use it in case there's in emergeny, help , or seeing if thier doing there work knowing if they fell asleep or bored.

Even though it's a form of new technology it can also be a good thing to have in class. Like showing if a student doen't get what the teacher is teaching can help to show how their emotions are toward it ," A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confussed or bored." The new technology seems as a good thing because it can help out the teacher and the students. Another thing it can do is they can know right a way with the computer and they don't have to trouble knowing that their are students who don't get at all what's going on and who to figure out what to do. Even it find out your emotions it can also find out if there genuine.

Also the device and let know if your really "engaed" like a real smile if it really real or it's fake. In classrooms they could be haelpful because the teacher can use to know who is really in what they are teaching or if your faking sick it tell right a way your not feeling bad. An example of this is," It's all the muscular action units. They even idicate the differeces between a genuine smile and if it is a forced one." So what the device actually show is the student is feeling bad because the device show's what muscles they use and it know when it is fake and forced. The fact it can know if someone is genuine is great of what the emotion can tell if someon is lying or say the truth.

The fact that you can know emotion by a device facincating. I think it is a really helpful tool because it know the emotion and whether they are false or true. I know teachers would think the same way to because it can really help them find out what are the students they can help out. I believe that is is a good system to have in classrooms for the students and teachers. What do you think?
