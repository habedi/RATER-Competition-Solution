Dear Principal,

I will like you to consider policy number 2. I see now students sometimes use their there notebooks to cover and start texting. This serious effects learning environment to everyone. If you let them text at free time, they might not be finish there conversations and start texting in class again. Also, sometimes in class their cell phones aren't turn off to. This will make the teachers take it and they will be all mad because of taking their phone.

If phones aren't allow they might be focus on the work more. This is because they have nothing to do. Also, students may say we need cell phones for emergency. Our teachers will protect us from it and will cause parents to be very worried. It will cause a distractions to because taking pictures or videos with there cell phones will create a uncomfortable feeling to some people. You could allow them with a free day to using their cell phones because of great test scores or improvement.

Cell phones were banned at the first place for reasons. So, you should do more decisions or research before choosing your choice. School is the place to get the education of everyone. Please consider my option .

sincerely, your student
