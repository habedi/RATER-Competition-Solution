Making all students participate in a extracurricular activity is a horrible idea! Some people might agree that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity but I disagree because not all students have the time to participate in activities at school. Some students have jobs, activities out side of school, and other responsibilities.

Let me start by saying making all students participate in a extracurricular activity in school is not a very bright idea! Some students have jobs and they might not have the time to participate in activities at school. For example, my oldest sister Generic_Name was on the cheer team and she also had a job but she had to quit the cheer team because her job hours and practice time was interfering.

Another reason I disagree with making all students participate in a extracurricular activity in school is because some students participate in activities out side of school. When they get home they have to get ready to go to practice so they wouldÃÂ´t have time to participate in a activity at school. Like when I was on the dance team and I wanted to do track but I couldnÃÂ´t because when I got home from school it was time for me to get ready for dance practice and track practice was at the same time as dance practice. This is why I disagree with making all students participate in a activity at school because not all students have the time.

Final reason why I disagree with this statement is because some students have responsibilities when they get home. They might have to get their younger sibling off the bus, babysit, or even clean the house. If they donÃÂ´t handel their responsibilities they might get in trouble or worst. One time my sister got in a lot of trouble because she was supposed to get me off the bus and she didnÃÂ´t because she stayed back for basketball.

In conclusion, making all students participate in a extracurricular activity at school is not a very bright idea. Some students have jobs, activities out side of school, and other responsibilities and are not able to participate in activities at school. This is why I say making all students participate in a extracurricular activity at school is a horrible idea!
