Dear Principal,

In My Opinion I Think That allowing students to bring their phone to school is okay because sometimes there are family emergencies and you may have to contact them at some point. Also kids have a social life and need to have fun during their teen years. Sometimes you might forget your lunch money and if you don't have a phone you can't call a parent to bring you lunch. That will affect how you pay attention in class because you might be to hungry and distracted of your stomach growling.

Even though there are negative things about bringing your phone to school there also is more positive things to bring you phone to school to. I agree that Policy 1 is a wise choice because it will decrease the risk of phone's being taken up. I think that kids will love Policy 1 the most because kids to have fun while their in school, not just plain textbooks second of school. Also since the kids have time to text and use their cell phones during certain times they won't have to use class time to text because they already had time.

Cell phones are very popular in school because everyone loves to communicate and chat with each other. That's why a lot of students use their phone during class because they talk to people but if they talk to people during their free time that might be better so in class they can turn off their phone since they already used it and actually listen in class. Then their grade might increase and be better. I'm not just saying this because i have a phone and like to text, I'm just saying this because more than half of the students in the district would go for Policy 1.

I am just speaking the truth about my own opinion and I am okay if you agree or disagree with what i think is right because not everyone thinks or acts the same. I go for Policy 1, it sounds right and is both fair for teachers and students. It is fair for students because they can use there phone on their free time without being worried about getting in trouble. It is fair for the teachers because they don't have to worry that much about taking up phones because students already used their phone and will have time to listen and learn in class. That's what I think is right & that's what I think should happen.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
