Emotions are the most hardest things to understand from yourself or from others, usually people can identify them if they now the situation that has, had or is about to happen. But there are some emotions or facial expressions that people just don`t know or understand what it`s supose to be or mean. This can be said for any thing. This can be said for about anything, but what would happen if someone had a machine that can tell you, mathematically and calculate what emotions you are felling or have felt if it is a photo.

To explain the machine , it is a computer the constructs a 3-D computer model of a face. It reconizes all 44 major muscles in a face of a model and must move like human muscles. It roconizes the action unit of a more muscles in a face. the machine was created by DR. Paul who created the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) and Dr. Huang. It basically tracks and understands differnt empotions by tracking and understanding facial expressions, since people le understand how a person feels based on physical expressions of the face. The computer is then able to under stand a persons emotion.

This level of technology is advense, but what would happen if this kind of computer was mobile and was used in a school, by teachers to know what emotions a student was feeling, to and they used as if it were a lie detector. Well there are pros for the teachers, like if a student was lieing to them about an assignment or a use it to understand what happened in their class by simply scanning the students and use the information they have to esstimate an answer. It would be convenient for the teacher or even a priciple to figure out what the student is feeling. Usually a teacher would ask the student about what happened to the student. They would use the computer if they don`t care and only want the truth from the student as a positive answer they would understand. They computer would most likely idintify someone who is lying and get punishment. It could also help a teacher understand if the student is under stress and would be able to do something before the student does something that would their greatest mistake they could end up taking. Other reasons is being able to find out why a student is queit and not talking to everyone that are his or her friends. They would even be able to find out secrets that a student is keeping from them, if it`s good or bad the teacher would simply be able to figure out what it is.

With every pro there is a con that exist, for one how would the computer be able to be mobile, the computer that can calulate emotions would be huge and bulky to carry aroung. Plus there arew few apps that can tell emotions ,even if they have a few mistakes. Besides that it would be consider an invasion of privacy, since most people would want to keep something a secret, like love. It would even something that students would try to get away from it either try to keep it a truth and really saying that you did an assignment or risk it all and get caught.

From all this information having aving a computer that teel emotions would have it`s ups and down,some being able to find some who has lied and catch them and even helping someone who have problems with themselves or at home. The con is that people would try to avoid it, or if they had to understand something they could just ask the student and have a conversation with them about whats wrong ang why. Having an emotion computer have some percs, but would be use on rare occasions.
