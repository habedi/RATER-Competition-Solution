In this generation, our planet is getting flithier and filthier by the day. What many people are too late to realize is that we are the main cause of our dirty planet. Cars contribute to air pollution a lot. What's the only solution to this smog filled atmosphere? There are many, but limiting car usage will definitely be beneficial and highly advantageous. Limiting car usage will help reduce air pollution significantly, and will even help humans out too.

We breathe the air in our atmosphere. When you notice that our atmosphere is as dirty as it is, you really don't want to think about what you are putting into your lungs. The amount of air pollution is an extreme amount, and if not controlled soon, we will be in danger. An advantage of limiting car usage would be that the air pollution will be benefitted, and will be getting lower hopefully. As Robert Duffer states Paris of having " intesifying smog."

Limiting car usage is also advantageous by taking away stress. Many people that drive all know what the pains are of being stuck in traffic. What if you don't wake up on time and you skip taking a shower, or skip eating breakfast, and speed as fast as you can to make it to work? It causes severe stress. From that point on in the day, you literally can't concentrate or focus and you just know it is going to be a rough day. Well, limiting car usage would take some stress away. See, super slow traffic , being late to work, skipping the most important meal of the day, it all just builds up into a lot of unneeded and unwanted stress. If people don't have to deal with congested highways, they could enjoy a nice walk to their job, or ride their bicycle. Doing this would instantly take away stress. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress..." says Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man(Selsky). There are cities that have tried having a day with no cars. It has worked in taking away stress, as you can see. Taking a bike ride or walking instead of driving a car is also beneficial becasue it's exercise.

Also, it helps in taking away stress and clearing minds. It is not a bad idea to start limiting our car usage, for we will receive the benefits of decreased car usage.
