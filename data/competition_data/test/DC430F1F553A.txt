My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some of those things students can do is sports, work on the school yearbook,and serve on student council. I agree on this choice because it can help students in many ways such as making friends, having fun, and can look good on college papers. Those are only some of the reasons extracurricular activities are helpful.

Being in extracurricular activities can make it easy to make friends. One example of this is when i joined soccer, i didnt know anyone so i had to make new friends. That helped me become much less nervous around them. so i can now joke and hang around them instead of feeling left out. Making friends can also help with having fun.

Having fun can come from making friends just like i did. One example of this is when i play soccer i can have a fun time with my friends as we win games. I liked being able to have fun with my friends at soccer because it helped build teamwork and a fun experience i will never forget. Another benefit of having fun and friends is it can look good for college.

Doing extracurricular activities can help with college too. Extracurricular activities can help you go to college by giving you scholarships for things like Wrestling, Baseball, Football, and American football. These scholarships can get you into colleges for free as long as you are in a sport or, they have a set amount of year you can use that scholarship. These scholarships can be very helpful because you wont pay nearly the same amount of money if you just went to college without a scholarship.
