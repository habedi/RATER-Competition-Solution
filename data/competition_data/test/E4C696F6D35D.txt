Dear: principle

We the students want for you too not change school policy because so some students are complaining that is not fear fore s too have a B or a C . Like many peoples have low grades. But you can make a difference by telling them that doing there work they can participate on all the activities and they can have at less a D

But if is lower then a D then they cant participate on the activities. But if you put more electives they would have too do there work and that's how they would do there work and you would be a good principle and the students will be learning a lot, but if you don't make that happed then all the students will get mad because if we don't get too participate in the activity, they would not do there work no more and they are going too get in treble.

Sincerely:STUDENT_NAME
