The worst feeling for a teacher is when their new class for the year walks in, and they barely even know what class they signed up for. Teacher designed summer projects provide students with an introduction to the the new material they will be learning for the year, and create a basis for the teacher to start off of during the beginning of the course. These projects assure that all students are on the same level, heavily reducing the work and stress put onto the teacher.

Most students nowadays will always look for the quickest and easiest way out. This leads to skipping over crucial learning aspects that are required thought the year. Furthermore, student designed summer projects wouldn't be nearly as effective as teacher created, due to how the students may be unaware of what they will be learning in the upcoming year. The students simply would not be able to create such a project that would be nearly as beneficial as a teacher created one. This concept can be show through diagnostic tests that students are prompted to take at the beginning of many courses. When tested on material about the class, the majority of students aren't even returned with a passing grade. The point of these tests are to show the improvement students make thought the year, and allow teacher to better understand what aspects of the class they need to go more in depth into. All being considered, students with a fresh mindset in any given class would not be able to create an effective summer project that would provide a strong lead way into the year.

All teachers have a certain amount of material they are supposed to cover thought the year, while in many cases they are given plenty of time to cover each topic of their course, time can becomes limited due to the extensive amount of time taken up at the begging of the year catching everybody up to speed on the basic foundations of the course. This can be greatly reduced if the summer projects that students are given, were designed by the teachers themselves. This allows the teachers to make sure everybody is on the same page at the beginning of the year, allowing a smooth transition into new content, and not wasting time on relearning the basics. This problem is present in many classes at the beginning of the year. An extensive amount of time is spent answering basic questions as to what the course is about, content from previous years, and basic fundamentals of the class that students should already know. All of these can be avoided by a well organized teacher created summer project because they know the course better than anyone else. Allowing teachers to create such a project would ensure both themselves, and the students are confident starting off the new year, and ready to learn.

Many students argue that student created summer projects would allow them to learn better because they will be able to pace themselves better. Many of people, including teachers, have found this to be true. Student created projects would ultimately allow them to create a fun project environment were they get to express their creative side, constructing a project that is both entertaining, and not as overwhelming as many teacher created projects, yet still covering material about the given course. This method, while at first glance may seem more effective, will not provide students with sufficient education and preparation that the teacher will have prepared for the year. By allowing teachers to create their own summer project for the students, it enables them to make sure all students are both prepared, and caught up with previous material that will set course for the challenging year ahead of them.
