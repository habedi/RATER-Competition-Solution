Dear State Senator,

I think the Electoral College shouldn't decide on electing the president. The electoral college only focuses on electors from the state that are pleged to one of the candidates trying to win presidency. The people are not actually voting who they want to become president. Somrtimes the Electoral College can take a long procces. If there is a tie between two candidates, meaning they both have 270 Electoral votes, the house of representatives would have to decide.

There are reasons for retaining the electoral college despite it's lack of democratic pedigree. Certainty of Outcome, if one of the candidates has the most electoral votes that candidate wins office. Onother would be the number of electors a state has, for instance, if one state has a bigger population than onother state it would contain more electoral votes for a candidate. Swing states, when a candidate has the majority of electoral vote, that wins office, thats why they have the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes.
