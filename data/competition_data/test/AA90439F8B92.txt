Summer Projects

Summer is full of learning and educational experiences. It is these experiences that stay with a person throughout their life. They shape who a person is and what they know. Schools sometimes require that students do a summer assignment. Why? It helps students learn what they need to, for their new classes, and reflect on these experiences. Summer projects differ in schools, for example, some schools have teacher-designed summer projects and other schools have student-designed summer projects. Schools should make these summer projects teacher-designed because students would take the assignment more seriously, have all students be on the same page on what they need to know, and would better prepare them for life outside of high school.

The first reason, that schools should make summer projects teacher-designed is because students would take their assignment more seriously. As students in high school, students are more likely to do something if an authority figure tells them to do so. For example, if a mom asks her daughter to clean her room then her daughter is more likely going to clean her room because her mom, the authority figure, told her to do so. It is because of the authority and respect that the teacher holds that the student would actually do the work and get a better grade. As one can see, students would take the assignment more seriously if a teacher were to design the summer assignment.

Another reason, that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because all of the students would be on the same page of what they need to know. When all of the students are given the same assignment from the teacher all the students know the same amount of information, but if students did their own assignments each student would be learning different information. For example, it is hard to study for a test when one doesn't even know what all is going to be on it. With the teacher-designed summer projects all students would know what they have to learn before class which would help students have the background knowledge that they may need for the class. Naturally, schools should have the summer projects be teacher-designed because it would help students be on the same page as everyone else in the class.

A final reason, that these projects should be teacher-designed is because it would better prepare students for the real world. The teacher-designed projects would help prepare a student for a job in the future. For example, if one has a really strict boss and they have to do a big job for their boss then they need to know that they need to manage their time well and do it correctly, unless they want to get fired. It is projects like this that helps students to know to manage their time and follow the directions of their boss to get the job done. As one can see, these projects should be teacher-designed because is would help students after they graduate high school.

Many people may say that student-designed summer projects are better because it helps students be less stressed. Although this may be the case, it is less stressful because students are not making their project complex. Students over the summer don't tend to think about school work during summer break until the end and it is with this that students, very last minute, decide to throw something together for their project. If students were told ahead of time by teachers students would know exactly what needed to be done and are more likely to manage their time and spread out their work. It is with the process, teachers making the summer assignments, that students would better understand and learn to manage their time wisely. As evidence provides, teachers should design the summer projects because it would help students manage their time better and get their work done.

In conclusion, schools should have teachers design the summer assignment because students would take their assignment more seriously, have a better understanding of what they need to know, and would prepare them for the real world. The teacher- designed project would help students be more responsible and independent. Imagine what the society in which we live would be like if students would be responsible and be able to do projects like this. Our society would prosper as a whole, education would be valued more, and summer would be a time for learning. The society in which we live would be better for everyone.
