i dont believe that driverless cars would be a good influence on our population. I say that because i dont think people would use these cars as good use. People wouldnt use these cars for good reason because they would take advantage of it because it can drive on its own, I know it would have a built in camera for our eyes on the road but lets just be real here noone will even take a glance at the road. These cars are really smart cars and all but what does this car do for us? I really think these cars wouldnt do us any good because none of us wouldnt want to drive anymore because it drives on its own therefore that would make us all lazy drivers. im sure these cars know alot but they probably dont know the importance of driving under roads that are under construction, or bad weather, slick roads. Which concerns me of all of our safety, and all our lives at risk. What if the roads are very slick and its foggy outside? i dont think the car can drive through that type of weather because at times it is very hard for us humans to drive under that condition.

Most of us have children and passengers while driving with us all the time i am very concerned of their safety too, what if they are not comfortable with these cars, they want you to take control of the wheel. We all have our opinions on things but these cars i really dont like the idea of it. Like money wise the cars would cost us millions probably for it and there are more important things in the world to buy, we really dont need to spend all our money on these cars. Gas money for these cars what if these cars use a lot of gas?

We would have to spend like another 80 to 90$ on gas too. The car what if the car alert system or camera stops working?

We have no other choice but to take the wheel, it shouldnt take all that money for a car and for something to happen to it and we have to end up driving it anyways, so we shouldnt even have this idea of these cars in my opinion its a waste of money. In conclusion i dont think it would be a good idea for us to have this new source of techinology because most of us wont even use it right and it could cause all kinds of problems.
