This mask was found on Mars and some people think it could have been created by aliens or it could be an Egyptian Pharaoh. In my personal opinion i think it is a natural landform. It could just be a rock that is shaped like a human face. We have all seen some sort of object that may look like a celebrity or an animal but that is just the way that it was shaped. Or it could be a crater formed in the shape of a human face.

NASA's evidence states that, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien moument. No one can prove that aliens are real or if they even existed and if it was a Egyptian Pharaoh it wouldn't be possible for anybody to be on Mars without the proper equipment. They would of probably found a some sort of rocket or something to prove that there has been someone or something on Mars.

If it were to be an alien where is the rest of the body? If the aliens were to of made the "face" where are they? We have seen mountains, hills, and rocks that look similar to something, just because it has the outline, doesn't mean that it is a face. If there is a face there has to be a body or something. You would need to prove that aliens are real or if they were even on Mars.
