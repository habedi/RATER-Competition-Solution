Dear principal,

How many times in the day do you use your phone? Well as you know your students at school have cell phones. Some are caught using them during class, at lunch, or during school hours at times. I believe you should allow students to use their phones at school. There are many reasons why. Just think, the school could have an emergency evacuation, the students might need a way to call home to be safe. Or even for an after school activity, they might have forgotten something at home or with someone they need to contact. Also it could be for the guardians contact to make sure their child is ok. So cell phones in school might just benefit the students more than you expect.

Students should have cell phones for emergency purposes. There might be an evacuation they requires the students to immediately leave the school building. The students are no longer able to use the school phones. So if you allow cell phones they can call their guardian in case of an accident involving them or others. Now doesn't that sound like a back up plan?

Many students join after school activities. In casual situations some might leave something they really need. Sometimes the child will need to call their guardian to tell them their need. If you permit cell phones students will not be able to call their guardian easily. Yes, their are school phones, but some people don't answer unknown callers.

Hence, sometimes the child may have to secure with the guardian. Which can also mean the guardian calls the student assuring the child's safety. In most cases the child is after school doing an activity. Yes, the child may have adult supervision , but the guardian still is not there. Think of how assured the child's guardian will be once they hear the child's voice.

In conclusion, i believe students should have the right to use cell phones at school. With their cell phone its more safety and assurance to the guardians. Also it helps with to the needs of a student. Fact of the matter is children communicate regardless of a cell phone. So why not enhance the cell phone for safety issues also.

Sincerely,

A student
