I agree with the principal, because students should try new things so every student in school do an extracurriculam like sports,working on the yearbook or being a student council. I say playing sports would be fun you can exercise and you also get motivated to play for a team of any sports,if you work on the yearbook you could be able to know who people are and it might be fun to help on the yearbook. Being a student council would be interesting, because you get to help other teens that has problems and what they need so then they could trust you and then you could be able to know what there intentions are of some sort. I think that it was a good idea for teens to do extracurriculam. Teens can turn that into a hobby so they can do while they're bored doing nothing. In my opinion,I think if students try new things they might like it because they would not know what they like to do best but in the future. I think the teens could have a similar careers in the future they could grow up to be a soccer player,basketball player or they could be a tennnis player in any other sports they could be one famouse player. If students work on yearbooks and planning how they are going to sell it and what the covers look. The teens would work to be a person who plans book and how they are published and could be an illistrator. People who makes book and sells it get a lot of money,teens who also want to do student councile will be amazing because when they grow up to be a councilor of some sort. they also could be a therapist who helps people that are traumitized or horrified or have problems of what is happening in there lifes. Thatis the reason why I agree with the principal, to make every student do an extracarriculam activty so they could get motivated so they could be what they want to when they grow up. Teens and kids are the future of life and I say that the teachers and principal wants the best out of us like are parents wants us to be very succesful in the future and be happy about it.
