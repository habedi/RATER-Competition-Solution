Limiting car usuage is an advantage to all citizens.  All around the world people are trying pass new laws to band cars.  When people do not use their cars the world becomes less polluted, clear skies would be nice.  Also this will promote a safe lifestyle as a pedestrian. Creating people to walk everyday will be a good habit to the society.

Countries all around the world are realizing that reducing the use of cars is a big success.  " When i had a car i always was tense.  I'm much happier this way"!  Even people love the lifestyle without their cars.  People are selling their cars and moving to Germany just to live in a place without vehicles. The people that disagree to this decison have no choice but to be fined thirty-five dollars or to be towed away.  People created a more enclosed habitat to citizens so it was not a great distance to walk to the store or even the mall.  " In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a mainstreet,  rather than in malls along some distant highway."  People around the United State are becoming less dependent on their cars.

Therefore, the less you use your vehicle the less populated the city will be.  The air will become clear as the car usuage lessens.  In Paris they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air.  People were fined thirty-one dollars if saw on the road.  The smog creates congestion in the air.  Also as the seasons change the warmer layer of air traps car emissions.  Seeing a clear picture is more important than driving a car when it is not necessary.

In addition, banning the use of cars will improve the safety of our citizens.  Creating cities in which "pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to improve our safety."  Not worrying about traffic and when you can or cannot cross the street would be very meaningful to our lives.  Accidents happen everyday, most deaths come from terrible car crashes.  There are a lot of dangerous things about driving, why would we need to risk our lives?  Stay safe and walk, run and rollerblade instead of wasting your life in a car that can risk it.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.  People are now considering to band vehicles which will improve the safety of citizens and make a less polluted economy. Nobody would deny the advantages of being more eco-friendly by decreasing the usage of cars. Everyone wants a safe enviroment and clear air to breathe!
