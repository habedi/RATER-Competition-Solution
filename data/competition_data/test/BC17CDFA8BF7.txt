Dear principal

I think that the principals shouldn't make all the students to perform community service, because maybe it would be good for other people, but some students don't have the time to do that, because maybe they need to take care of their little brother when their parents are going somewhere and can't take the children with them, and they don't have the money to pay a babysitter or the don't have any related to take care of them. Maybe the students don't want to do it, because they can't do it, because they want to hang out with their friends, go to the movies, or go to the park and play some kind of sport, or maybe they want to hang out with their girlfriend. If you make all the students to do community service, some are not going to go, because they got to take care of the little kids, or because the don't want to and that's going to cause more problems in the school and the students are going to get detention, because they didn't do their community service. Also if you force them to do community service its like they don't have no rights to make their own decisions. Maybe some students want to do community service, but that doesn't mean that all the student should be doing community service. That's why i think that the principals shouldn't make all the student to perform community service.
