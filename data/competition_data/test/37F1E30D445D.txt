Phones and Driving

In today's society many phones have become an essential part of life. We use our phones everyday to talk, text, share pictures/ videos, and to use gps locaters. Although we are on our cell phones daily for various reasons there is a time and a place to use them. One time you should never use your cell phone is when operating a motor vehicle. The use of a cell phone can lead to many fatalities that can harm you or others.

Texting while driving can be distracting, dangerous, and can lead to a accident. Picking up your phone for even a second means that your attention is not on the road and can lead to a fatal even deadly crash. Texting while driving is a manual, visual, and cognitive distraction. Taking one or more hand off the steering wheel is an example of an manual distraction and not having both hands on the wheel can lead to you not having complete control over the vehicle. Not having your eyes on the road is an example of a visual distraction and can lead to you crashing into something. Lastly, texting and driving is an example of a cognitive distraction because you are not focused on the road.

Taking your eyes off the road can lead to a horrific accident that can cause harm to yourself or others. You should always be considerate of others around you whether its passengers in the car or pedestrians around you. Distracted driving means that while you aren't paying attention you could be crashing into someone and possibly taking their life. When looking down at your cell phone you aren't able to pay attention to what's going on around you nor will you be able to see a pedestrian. Will you be able to live with yourself knowing that you were the reason someone's life got taken away from them because of you?

In todays technology there are many alternatives to texting and driving. Cars now have wireless Bluetooth where you can answer the phone with a click of the button on your steering wheel. You can also speak your text messages so you don't have to look at your phone and divert your attention from the road. Even if you don't have a car with Bluetooth cell phones now come with a hands free feature and a do not disturb while driving feature. Manufactures are making it easier and easier to drive safely while also still being able to communicate effectively and efficiently with others.

In conclusion, texting while driving can be extremely dangerous and should never be an option. It can lead to accidents and will distract you from the road. Once you take your eyes off the road you are not only putting yourself in danger but others too. There are too many new alternatives if you need you use your cell phone while driving therefore the percentages of deaths due to distracted drivers should not increase.
