Dear Principal,

In all of the students in this schools opinion is that this is a bad idea to let students with at least a grade B average should be the only students participate in sports or other school activities, because many students have gotten their grade up by joining a school sport or other activities.

Therefore many students have had the feeling that they really want to join or have had a dream about joining one of their favorite sports or activities and they try their best to have at least a grade B average, so they can join the sport or activity that they are interested in.

Even though many students try their best at trying to reach the grade B average to join their favorite sport or activity; maybe most of the other students will start to fail all of their classes, because they would think that they would never make at least a grade B average; they would start to give up and most of the parents, teachers, and principals around the world don't want that to occur because they want all of the students to work hard and give everything that they got, so someday when they get older they can have a nice job or nice things that they want, because this would help them work as hard as they could and become successful during life.

There on, if more students won't have the opportunity to join the sport or activity that they want they'll go and tell their parents and this wouldn't be a good thing, because the student's parents would start to argue with you and demand that they want school policy to change. So their children could join their favorite sport or activity; most of the principals around the world wouldn't like that because they might get into a lot of trouble or be fired because they wouldn't do anything good for many different students in the world.

Even though, you might be still thinking about not change the school policy many students do need to join different types of sports or activities, because this can keep them healthy or make them learn new materials that they have never heard about and this can help many students with their education, which is important because it can probably help the economy grow and they could someday become one of the most successful people ever know.

So therefore I think that you shouldn't change the school policy and only let students with at least a grade B average be the only students to join school sports and activities.
