Emotions the things that make us feel happy,sad,angryand scared. But they also show our humanity its difficult for people to understand one another and harder to know how one feels. But a new techology called facial action coding system enables computer to identify human emotions. I think its not right to determin if someone is happy or sad by using a machine. If a simple person can't figure out what emotions someone is feeling then i dont see why they'll trust a coding system that uses 44 muscle found in your face. To see if your feeling whatever emotion your feeling based on how your muscles where being used at the time of the scanning.

For classroom use i see zero ways this can improve anything for students. Because students are emotionally unstable and there moods can switch at any given time. The artical also said something about imagine being infront of your computer and seeing an add the way you react to the add will make it so you don't see it anymore. I think its useless for a coding system to try and calculate how someone feels. The artical gives a great example

"you can tell how your friend is feeling simply by looking at there face"

this little fact made me think that both a human and computer can see your face and how both might say your sad or mad because of the way your face looks right then and there. But nether a computer nor human can trully know what that person feels inside of them.

I dont see how anyone thought this coding system could benifit anyone let alone students. this coding system that can read human emotions might be fun but serves no use for a school. it might be really good for things like seeing how kids react to new toys or cereal before you make a product go on the shelves of stores. besides that this coding system is useless in my eyes.
