Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus will gain insight on the planet itself. That our curiosity will likely lead us into our travels beyond our fears. We should not be limited by doubts, but to strive. We should meet the very edges of imagination, and concur our fears.

The author included lots of information of the planet Venus, and also some fun facts in which I also included in my passage. Venus is referred to as the Earth's twin. Venus is closest to Earth in density, the size, and sometimes in distance. In spance terms human have sent lots of spacecrafts to land on the cloud draped world. No spacecraft has survived the landing for more then a few hours on Venus. This is why a single space ship hasn't been on Venus in more than three decades.

With such a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets around Venus. The author has been stating lots of backgound information about Venus which helps on knowing when we need to have to be able to stand the conditions. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times what we experience on our planet each day. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our very soloar system, even if Mercury is closer to the sun. Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system.

Venus still has some features that are close to the same on Earth. The planet has a hard rocky surface that includes valleys, mountains, and craters. The author is talking about new ways to apportch the planet without having to land on it because of its toasty temperatures. There still isn't a way to get samples of its land, but with all the information they have gathered where they can have our machines last long enough that they can stand the harsh climates of Venus. However, all they need right now is to get up close. The author doesn't think because there's a obstical in the way of a new discovery you shouldn't give up. To learn to adapt with the information you have will help down to road t your success.
