Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm sorry to say but I do not agree with changing the school policy to have to have a B average to participate in sports. Some students with a C average are better than the A

and B average students which would make our teams worse. Our sports teams are the best in state! If we lose any of our good players that have below a C average we could possibly be the worse team. As a cheerleader myself I don't think it would be fair. Some students are just not smart. Please don't punish them to not play sports because they are not book smart. I understand this may get students to try harder to get their grades up and not pay as much attention to sports than academics, but I think it would be best to keep the school policy the way it is. Another reason I think we need to keep the school policy the same is a lot of parents would not be happy which we cause a lot of problems. Many parents would come to the school and complain which we cause a big mess that we could avoid if we don't change the school policy. Please take my suggestions into consideration. I no I am just another student at SCHOOL_NAME, but i think this could help our school to not a have problems with sports. We should just leave the school policy the way it is so no one gets harmed.

I do agree with changing the school policy for other activities besides sports. This may sound weird , but that is just my opinion. Other activities are not as important as sports and academics to most students which wouldn't cause hardly any trouble as for changing the school policy on for other activities.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
