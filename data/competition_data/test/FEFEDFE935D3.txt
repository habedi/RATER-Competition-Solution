Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I am addressing you on the issue if all students at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to do community service. I believe that each student should need some community service hours. Each student should do something to benefit our community. At the same time they should not be required a ridiculous amount of hours if the student doesn't think they should do community service. My reasoning for this is this community gives there tax dollars for us to get the things we do at this school. The least we can do is give back by doing something like cleaning, daycare, tutoring, etc. When deciding on this issue students need to think about that. If it wasn't for our community we wouldn't be allowed to get the education that we are getting.

At the same time we do not need to have a surplus of hours put on a student to do. If passed a reasonable number of hours needs to be set. My reasoning for saying this is that if a student here wanted to do after school activates the community service does not need to interfere with things like sports and clubs. For example if I was on three teams witch I am and had to do twenty hours of community service, I would have a over planned schedule if I still planned on having exceptional grades So a student can be involved with those too witch I am a strong supporter of. This is my thoughts on this issue thank you for your time.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
