Participating in the seagoing program was the best thing that ever happened to me. Even if it does't seem that interesting, you should try it. I know, some people don't like do get out much but this is better than anything you can do inside.

It is a very good experiance to go seagoing. You get to see a lot of different places and meet different people with different life styles. Sometimes it is weird hearing them talk, but sometimes it can be funny. The people also ask about our country. They wonder about the people, food, and animals that we have. They also wonder what our houses look like.

I think you should go seagoing because it's like nothing else. Traviling the sea, and seeing the water as the sun sets. It's like nothing else. I also love the sound of the ocean. It calms me when I miss home. But sometimes, the ship feels like home.

I very much wish so that you will go seagoing, because it's the best thing you will ever do. If it doesn't interest you thats ok. There are millions of other things to do. Maybe it's just not for you. But for me, it's just right.
