Dear Principal,

Firstly I believe that you should allow students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

I believe this, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME for my seventh grade year we were allowed to have our phones during lunch and other free time as long as it was in are lockers during classes.

Also then if students needed to call their parents to come and get during the school day when they couldn't remember their parents number, they could get a hold of them.

Secondly when students are allowed to have their phones during lunch and other free time the students most likely to keep their phones in their lockers during classes, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME the student who had phones in class was less.

That was a good thing so the teachers could go through all the lessons they had planned for this class period.

And thirdly then there was less students getting in trouble, and less cell phones getting taken away from the students.

That is why I believe that student should be allowed their phone during lunch and other free times, thank you for your time.

Your Student,

STUDENT_NAME
