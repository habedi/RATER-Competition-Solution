To the principal:

Cleaning trash is important.

cleaning trash helps save the environment and keep the ecosystem healthy. If the environment becomes unhealthy plants and animals will die. Basically the less trash there is, the healthier Americans and the animals around the world wi. Also if students do community service it will teach them discipline. I believe if community service was mandatory it would be a big help although some people disagree.

Some students dislike doing community service, to try to persuade them to do it they should get something small in return such as a gift card to a bookstore or something similar. If students have the ability to earn something, most likely, they would like to participate.

There should also be a day to do community service. If students were able to go every day, then students would take advantage of this to get out of classes. The day to clean up local trash should rotate between a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. Every week , the school should rotate.

If the school could this at least once a week, even once a month, it would help the environment. Although students may dislike the idea they would still get something out of it. Anything we can do to help the environment will be a huge help. Eventually are school would even be a role model for others. Then the environment will be helped even more. I think you would agree with this idea.
