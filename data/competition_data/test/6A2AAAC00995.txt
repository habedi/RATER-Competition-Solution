Should students part take in a extracurricular? well I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because, it gets students more involved with his or her community and keeps students active and on their feet. This will teach students many skills that could benefit them in the future.

First off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. For example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. Joining a sport discovered many things I didn't already know about myself. I learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. Therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.

Next, Joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. This leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. For example, I joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my best friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into. That decision was one of the best choices i've ever made. In addition, You'll get to meet all kinds of people from around your community, learning more about them each day and everyday, how similar or how different they're from you. At the end of it, it is nice to see all different or similar types of people that are surrounding you in your daily life.

In conclusion, I think you should join an extracurricular because you can benefit so much off of it. Including many life skills that will help you such as, communication skills, leadership skills, listening skills and many more skills that will help you along your path. Getting to know the people around you is a nice experience that I think every person should have the opportunity to get.
