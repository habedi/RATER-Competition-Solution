Online learning has been growing in popularity with the rise of accessible technology. This allows for more learning opportunities that typically limit students from applying due to restrictions on location. Compared to learning in the traditional classroom, online learning is a viable substitute due to all the benefits that it provides. In the current world, where many aspects of society are shifting towards digital application, online learning may eventually become a staple. Students would benefit from distance learning as online and video conferencing could provide many advantages such as flexible schedules, better material, and educational tools.

Distance learning has the ability to enroll students from a vast majority of the world as, essentially, it only requires a stable internet connection and a functional computer. This nullifies any locationÂ requirement that usually deters students from applying to the school of their choice. By allowing people from all over the world to virtually attend from home, this eliminates the need for students to physically travel to the school's campus. A course styled like this would allow for more flexible schedules as students could define when they wanted to attend and fit in their work schedules. In a practical application of this idea, classes could be scheduled at night, when people are home from work. Not only does this allow them to pursue their educational goals, but it also gives people the opportunity to advance their career.

In addition to a more flexible schedule, online courses could also provide more content. This is achieved by reducing classroom activities that would waste class time and removing the need to commute to school. Since commuting to school is unnecessary, online classes could be longer to allow for more information to be taught. Students could also work at their own pace in the minimal-distraction environment which exponentially increases learning efficiency. Then, labs for practical application within the traditional classroom would be substituted by simulations that are rich in information and less time-consuming. With this excess time created from the efficient learning style, additional activities could be planned to enhance the course experience. For example, some online classes could use the extra time for teaching students the introduction of other courses or students could do additional research and self-learning that would benefit themselves.

A major advantage of the online learning environment is the ease of accessibility. Although the online learning style may not be compatible with everyone, there are many tools and techniques that make the experience better. Everyone has a different learning style and online learning is unique in the way that it tries to be universally compatible for all students. On top of that, distance learning such as online or video conferencing offers the ability to record and play back video. This allows for students to easily catch up on the work that they missed if they were unable to complete a lesson. Generally, lessons in the traditional classroom can often be confusing and students easily miss parts of the notes, but this is resolved through the recordings that the students can quickly reference to. Not only will this help them with writing notes, it will also clairfy confusing parts of the lesson by reviewing over it with the footage.

Students will certainly benefit from attending classes from home as online learning provides all of the following unique advantages: better schedules, greater content, and easier tools. The freedom of having a better schedule will allow students to focus on their lives while committing to a better education. More content will benefit the students in the long run as they prepare to apply that knowledge to their life. The helpful tools that come with the online class are easy to access and benefit the learning process of the student. All these benefits will appeal to anyone as they are truly helpful. In order to truly understand this experience, why not give it a try? There are many free, online learning platforms such as edX and MIT's online course archive that will give anyone an insight to how effective this approach is.
