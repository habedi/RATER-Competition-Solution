Dear Principal,

Hi, I am the one of student in your school. I heard that you are considering about changing school's policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I think it is good idea to changing school's policy, but I would think more about the students. Many students are having C average right now. If you change the school's policy, some of students will get B average, but what happened if not most of students are getting enough grade that you wanted? I bet the most students will arguing about this school policy.

The sports are students hobby. If they don't have sports because of the grade, they will have stress. I think this school policy will going good, but they will get stress of it. Also, it is not a high-school yet, they need some break. If you wanted to keep the most students' grade, you can think of more homework, or more work in the class, but don't give too much homework or work. Just get little bit more and more and more. Start with one piece of paper, and keep add one more paper, then the students won't going to have hard time to finish with it. They might don't know the difference, because they might got use to it. You can't change all the students smarter at once.

I would not recommend this school policy. I know that you try to make us smarter, and I know that you think a lot about this changing policy, but please think one more time deeply and decide it for us and school.
