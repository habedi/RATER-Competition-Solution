it's mainly talking about how many percent of people do not own cars or people who old there cars. If I had a good car nothing wrong with it. I would make payments on it. It might not be the best car but hey long as i can get somewhere on time. I really don't know much about Vaubans but they are knid of nice. My dream car is V8 Titans Nessian i really love those trucks I hoping my mother will get me one but that all depends on my behavior at home and school plus grades those are more important. When the suburbs came out i thought it came from china but it said "Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class familes from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes. And that experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States." It also saids "Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway." I love cars well actually theres curtent cars that i like but hey you got to love them right V8 titan i love the most.
