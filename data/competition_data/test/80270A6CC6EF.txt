Extra curricular activities can help a student improve not only in skills that the activity teaches but also socially. If my principal told everyone that they would have to participate in an extracurricular activity kids from my school would not like it at first, then they would see that it is not so bad. It would force some students to try something new and get out of their comfort zone. If a student already participates in activities then they can improve in that activity. For some students if not forced they will not interact with others. If the school gives them a nudge in the right direction it would be a huge help. All kids should be required to participate in extra curricular's because they can improve on their preexisting skills, get new experiences, and form a stronger community.

If a student already plays a sport then they can use this opportunity to learn new skills. There are many different techniques and a student may have only been exposed to one. If a team understands the strategies of another team then their defense will improve. They can also learn new moves to improve their offense. All aspects of a players game could improve by learning from others so why not learn from your classmates. If a student does not play sports but is interested in helping put the yearbook together then they can improve their communication skills. Then use those new skills to help their group to communicate about their project and make it easier. Joining an extracurricular activity will improve any skills that are needed in the club that a student is joining.

Students can get new experiences from being required to join a club and they might even find an activity that they really enjoy. A student might not have had time to try an activity or they might have been to scared to. A student may not have ever tried playing volleyball before because they were playing other sports or were involved with other organizations. With this rule implemented the student could try playing volleyball and hate the sport or they could end up loving it and it could become their favorite. Requiring students to participate in extra curricular activities gives students a perfect opportunity to try out activities they have always wanted to try.

When a lot of a schools students know each other it will create a stronger community. When people with the same interests hang out together they usually form some sort of friendship. A strong community will only positively impact a school. It will result in less bullying, less harassment, and better friendships between the students. Everyone will have a couple of friends to sit with at lunch from their activity so no one will sit alone at lunch and everyone will have someone to say "hi" to in the hallways. A school with required activities will form a stronger community and therefor a stronger school in general.

It should be a requirement for students to be involved in extra curricular activities, they can form a stronger community, try new activities, and expand their skill set. If the principal makes a rule that all students have to participate in after school activities then students will have an opportunity to get better at things they have already tried and enjoyed or learn how to participate in a completely new activity. Not only is a person learning new skills but also making new friends and creating a stronger community within the school. It is important for students to have a group of friends and having mandatory extra curricular's would make it easier to find that group. Overall having mandatory extracurricular activities would make the school a stronger and more enjoyable place to be for the students.
