Dear Principal,

I think that to be able to participate in school sports and other activities you shouldn't have to get a B average. Students not only need to be active to be healthy but it also supports brain function. And if you take that away to some people it could causes them harm.

I do agree with having at least a C average but if you change it to a B then lots of kids wouldn't be able to participate in sports maybe not that they aren't smart but that they made a mistake while doing a math problem or that they forgot to do their homework because their grandmas in the hospital and they were there all weekend and just didn't have time. C is average and there are lots of average people it doesn't mean their not smart it just means they aren't as smart as the brilliant people.

Students need to be able to be active and healthy. By taking sports away it takes away opportunities from them. For scholarships, health, learning, and attitude. These are all reasons why not to take away sports and activities for students who get an average of a C.
