Venus is the second planet from our sun, and it is periodically referred to as earth's twin. Both planets have the same size and density, but the similarities stop there. The atmosphere of Venus consists of 97% carbon doxide, clouds of sulfuric acid, and the hottest surface temperetue of any planet orbitting the sun. Despite this, scientists have tried to send unmanned spacecrafts to the surface of Venus. Scientists think that Venus may have been the most earthlike planet, with the planets surface like valleys and mountains and possible evidence of oceans that may have existed long ago. The author believes that it is worthy to continue trying to explore Venus despite its dangers.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the similarities that Venus has with the Earth and indicating that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth. In the text it states, "...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth" This quote supports my claim because the author gives some evidence that Venus had some sort of body of water. The author might believe that Veus can be habitable. Another piece of information supporting my claim states, " ...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." This quote supports my claim because the author believes that if the Earth becomes a place that does not support life, the studies of Venus can help us understand and mve if necessary.

Venus can be Earth's evil twin, with its poisonous atmosphere and extremely horrific temperatures. The author still believes that research should continue given the similarites between Earth and Venus. He believes that Venus is presenting a challenge and one day, with technology, scientists will be able to overcome it. Perhaps one day we will visit Earth's twin.
