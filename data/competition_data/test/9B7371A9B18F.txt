this policy should not be continued many kids have a C grade average which is for average. kids should still go for higher grades such A' s or B' s but the grades shouldn't keep kids from doing what they love. it is hard to say weather this is a good policy or not. it has its positives and negatives. some positives are that kids will strive for higher grades, work harder in class to be able to play in this sport, club or activity. also they may have fun working so hard and find some class they truly enjoy and my have a possibly job opportunity in.

some negatives of this polity is some kids may have disadvantage that makes it harder to learn they also could have disability or "handicaps"

and have trouble getting good grades reading or writing preventing them to get much higher then a C average these kids may really want to do a sport or activity but they can't. because they have trouble in school and have trouble learning. this make them feel stupid or that having there disability is bad when it is not. this could lead to emotional distress, sadness or even depression which has a possibility to lead to self abuse like cutting, drug intake, or alcohol abuse. this could affect them as a adult. i have had experience and i no how these kids feel i to have ADD. this is a big optical in everyday life in and out of school. i can barley focus on anything. and this makes it hard to do homework, class work etc. i also have a brain chemical imbalance so i no have hard it can be to get A or B

in school. i barley get a C

in my classes so i think you should not have the new policy for these kids so they may have fun with others and feel good about themselves.
