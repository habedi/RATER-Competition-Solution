Dear Principal,

Technology has had a major role in the world to the point where people are debating weather we have the right to use cell phones during school or not I would like to say that i think cell phones should be allowed in school.

Children should be restricted from using them during important parts of the day and get consequences for having them our during class but i think they should get some time for themselves during the day. We should be allowed to use them during lunch and other free periods because we have social lives, they allow us to communicate with others and kids enjoy being on their cell phones.

Firstly, cell phones should be allowed in school because we have social lives. Everyone has a social life and they shouldn't be restricted to it just because they're in school. If we allow kids to use their cell phones during free periods it will allow them to get some time for themselves and take a break from all the education for a while. In one recent study, children were put into two different groups. Half the kids were allowed to have cell phones during free period and others were not allowed to have cell phones during free period. The group that did hade their cell phones had a better attention span during class and they did better on their work buy putting in more effort. The kids who weren't allowed to have cell phones put in their normal amount of effort and teachers didn't see an improvement in the way the children worked. This shows that if we give kids a chance to take a break from school work and let them have time with their social lives, they will work harder and pay more attention because they aren't thinking about things happening on their phone or on their social networking accounts that things often in stead they would be focused on class work.

Secondly, cell phones should be allowed in school because they allow us to communicate with others. Wouldn't it be nice to have a time of day when you can all mom or dad or even other friends or relatives? If we were allowed to use cell phones in schools children would be able to talk to their loved ones who would encourage them to do better in school. Some kids have very close friends who they can call if they need advice on something. For example, if someone was bullying them they should be able to talk to someone outside of school that they trust. Also, if they need some encouragement to do well on an important test they can call family members so that they can give them the push they need to ace an important test. This would make kids happier and refreshed since they have someone to talk about school work or to help them get their mind off of boring school work.

Lastly, cell phones should be allowed in school because kids enjoy being on their cell phones. 95% of the kids in our school have a cell phone and enjoy using their cell phone for many reasons. They can check e-mails, text and call others. This makes them happy which is a good thing because kids should be happy when coming to school. The shouldn't be depressed or sad. If we were allowed to use our cell phones during free period we would be happy and possibly not tried or bored during classes.

It would help us pay more attention to the teacher and it would help us not get tempted to sneak a peak at our phones which would make us loose our attention span. Having time to check our cell phones would help us learn more during school.

In conclusion, cell phones should be allowed in school because we have social lives, they allow us to communicate with others and kids enjoy being on their cell phones. Cell phones give kids a break from learning and it gives them time for themselves. Kids shouldn't be deprived of their freedoms and social life. Personally, i think children who go to schools who allow them to have their cell phones during free periods do better in school because they are refreshed after being able to go back to their social lives for once.
