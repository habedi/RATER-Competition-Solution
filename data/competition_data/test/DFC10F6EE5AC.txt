Just cause it looks like a face it does not mean there are aliens. When have there ever been real signs of aliens. Even if there where they would have shown themselves to astronuts. Honestly alien most likely would not be scared of us realelisticy.

If aliens where real they weapons and mind would probaly be more advanced. They would have to have made homes, spacecrafts and probably guns as well. Think about it it has to be a natural land form just look at the our worlds natural land forms. Im sure there are landformes that look like faces or objects somewhere. So it must be a landform that is the only way because aliens would have showed them selves by now it is just that simple.

The eyes where probly shadow on a rock that looks like a face and that probable the truth. Also its impossible for somthing to live with out oxygen and there are no trees meaning no oxegen. It also either really hot or really cold mening somthing would either over heat or if cold freeze and that is my argument.
