Dear TEACHER_NAME

I do no think students should be required to do community service. Whether or not someone helps they community is their choice. If they feel like its a waste of time it is their opinion. It might also interfere with their schedule, some students have very packed lives. From the time they get up in the morning to the time the go to sleep at night they are go, go, go. They barely have time for themselves in a regular week, so it would be hard for them to find them time to help out in the community. As for the people who won't help because they don't feel like it or because they want to do some thing else that's their choice, granted it's not a very good choice but it is theirs. They are the ones who will have to live with the choices they made in life not you.

In addition if you make it a requirement for us to do community service it may cause problems. The students that don't feel like doing it or don't have time to do it may not do it at all, and if you made community service part of our grade and they don't do it they might start failing in school because of the grades they are not receiving due to not doing community service. The last thing we want is kids failing in school because they don't have the time to help our community. I do think you should let community service be an exploratory option like art, technology and drama though. It will give the kids who do want to help our community a chance to do so.

Why put yourself through the stress of having to deal with children rebelling against it when you can just not do it. I hope you will choose what you think is best for our school, but i also want you to take my views into consideration and choose not to make it mandatory.
