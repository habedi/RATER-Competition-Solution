Phones & Driving

"if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle."

Drivers should not have the chance to be able to use cell phones while in the capacity of operating a vehicle. This should already go without saying that being on your cellular device distracts you from the road and every thing around you so your reaction time to important things will be decreased greatly and you would be more likely to get in an accident. "Distracted driving is dangerous, claiming 3,450 lives in 2016 alone. NHTSA leads the national effort to save lives by preventing this dangerous behavior." "Distracted driving is any activity that diverts attention from driving, including talking or texting on your phone, eating and drinking, talking to people in your vehicle, fiddling with the stereo, entertainment or navigation system-anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving."Drivers everywhere has and still do use their phones while driving. We say that driving while using your phone is illegal, but end up using your phones or doing everything else except drive.

"Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed." Everyone thinks that if they don't text that person or watches the last part of a funny video while driving its going to disappear, when the reality is that its going to be at the same place. "NHTSA's campaigns and public service announcements make the case to Americans that safe driving means driving without distractions. You've likely seen or heard our public service announcements, but we're also on Facebook and Twitter sharing stories and tips to help save lives." There are so many people trying to stop texing and driving because it can kill multiple people depending on who got in the accident or around it.

"Your State legislature and governor make the laws regarding distracted driving. Many States now have laws against texting, talking on a cell phone, and other distractions while driving. You can visit our State Laws page to learn about the laws in your State." As you can see that texting and driving is really serious. The state wants everyone to be safe and no harm to come to people.
