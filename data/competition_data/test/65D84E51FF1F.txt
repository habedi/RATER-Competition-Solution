The challenge of exploring venus is very risky because the dangers at the planets surface and around the planets atmosphere. Even though the planet shows lots of risks for us to explore it is still worth exploring our twin planet. The risks of exploring venus are the thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanketing venuse. The clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere.

The surface temperature averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than what we experience on earth such an environment would crush even a submarine accustormed to diving to the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy many metals. The planet also has additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

But dispite the risky conditions NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface would be to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape . At 30 pluse miles above the surface temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be more like the air pressure at sea level on earth. These arent easy conditions but survivable for humans.
