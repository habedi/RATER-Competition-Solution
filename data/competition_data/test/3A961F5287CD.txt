Using this new Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would be a valuable asset for understanding how students feel during a lesson. Students will often start to feel boredom or confusion and the facial recognition system will be able to pick up on those emotions. With this information given to teachers, they can change their lesson to make it more meaningful to those students who feel emotions like boredom or confusion. There are many possibilities with this technology when it comes to understanding how students truly feel through out the school day.

The Facial Action Coding System uses a serious of percents to show how a person is feeling. For example, the famous "Mona Lisa" painting displays eighty-three percent of happiness, nine percent of disgust, six percent of fear, and two percent of anger(D'Alto, Nick). If this technology is applied to students, then teachers can finally understand how each and every student feels during their class period. Teachers would also be able to recognize if someone may be overly sad or angry. This could enable students to receive help faster from a counselor or parent if they are depressed or anger over something. Understanding is a student is depressed with this new technology could save so many lives due to the fact that teen suicide rates are higher now than they ever have been.

With the new rise of facial recognition software, it can be used in the classroom to help teachers identify how students are really feeling in their classroom. The system could be used to determine if a lesson is confusing or boring a student, which helps the teacher know how they could change up their lesson plan. It may also be used to save lives by recognizing a student who is depressed so that they can get help as soon as possible. To finalize everything, this new technology would be extremely useful for both the teacher and the student in identifying true emotions throughout the school day.
