I really think that driverless cars are a good idea and a bad one I think many accedints would happen with driverless cars because humans wouldn't have control over the cars.

Im against driverless cars although its a very cool idea. I wouldn't mind driverless cars because of the fact of how cool it would be to have a car that drives on its own in the future. Im against it because I think it would cause many accedents. People would get injured. Google says that there driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. This is a good thing that they have driven this much without getting into a crash but i would still need more information to convince me that this car is safe.

I would personally prefer the old steering wheel because i would like to have full control and because I dont know if i could trust a car that drives on its own. I think many of the laws would have to be strict. If the driverless car who would be responsible the car manufacturer or the person in the car.

This driverless car in the future should not be allowed in my opinion its just not safe to have them around because no one is in control of the car. So i would not buy this car i would stick to the steering wheel where i will have control of me vehicle.
