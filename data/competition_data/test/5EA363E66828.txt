Dear Principal,

I think that the use of cell phones during free times and lunch time is a great idea and also keeping them off in the classroom is a good idea because if you don't allow them at all the students will just bring them any way and get in trouble for it, but if you go with the first policy they will bring them but only get in trouble if they take the phones out in class and it is not off so what I think is that they should be allowed at lunch and other free times but off and out of site during class time.

This is a good thing because many kids will get in trouble and get their phones taken up if the other policy is put in place instead of the First policy for the kids will bring them anyway so that is what I think but the decision is up to you and I know you will make the right choice but I ask one thing choose wisely. For on one hand is trouble and on the other one is peace and tranquility but as I said before it is your choice so with that I say goodbye and happy choosing.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
