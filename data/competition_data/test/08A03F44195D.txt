dear principal, i highly disagree with having to have a B average in order to play sports. i disagree because a c meets the standards and not everyone is bright enough to exceed the standards and i don't think it's fair to have students make a B or better. another reason is because the teams may not have enough players to play if everyone needed a b average.

the first reason, i disagree with the principal is because a c meets the standards and it's a passing grade. therefore students should be able to get ac and still play sports. also a B is exceeding the standards and all students aren't bright enough to have an exceeding grade that might deserve to be on the team.

simultaneously, the teams may not have enough players to play if everyone needed a B average because everyone cant get a B average. then by the ti8me that everyone gets their grades up the season will probably be over. plus half of the students that do have their grades at a B average might not want to play the same sports that most others do want to play so that would make it even less players eligible to play for the teams.

in conclusion, this is why i disagree with the principal and their decision of making students have to have a B average in order to play sports. one reason is there may not be enough players and another reason is its not fair. this is why we should able to play sports if we don't have a B average.
