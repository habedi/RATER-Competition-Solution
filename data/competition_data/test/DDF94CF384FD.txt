Learning over summer break is typically not ideal for students, but some classes do require it. Students procrastinate and avoid the summer projects because they want to enjoy their break, not spend it working on something for school. They do know themselves best, and therefore they should be able to design their own projects before summer to make it easier for them to do the project. I think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for students to get the work done and learn from it. With a bit of help from teachers, students would be able to design projects that they know would be the easiest and best way for them to learn over summer break.

Summer break is a precious time for students. They get to relax away from school, spend time with friends, and enjoy a stress-free 3 months. If they were able to design the projects they have to do over this cherished time, I can say that most of them would not avoid it as much. I believe students would not procrastinate on something they have specifically tailored for their own learning capabilities. Whenever I have a project assigned that is made by a teacher in a way that I do not learn easily through, I procrastinate on it and put off getting it done. As a student, I love summer break, and I would not want to do a project that I know I will not enjoy.

Every student learns differently. We do not receive or process information the same way. If students were to create their own projects, they would be able to make something that they know they can learn from. True, teachers can see what students struggle with and what they should be learning, but they cannot know how the student works mentally. Only the student can truly know themselves. When teachers assign projects with product options such as art, writing, acting, or others, I find it rather nice. I can choose what I know I will be able to do and get it done faster, as opposed to a project where I cannot choose what I do. This personalized learning is a much better experience for students than all students being treated like they think the same way. We are all human beings who are very different individuals.

Teachers may think they should be the ones to design these projects since they know the curriculum and have probably seen what projects seem to have worked in the the past. However, the world changes, people change, and learning should change with it. Students should be able to make projects that work just right for them, and if they have the help of a teacher to do it, then it could be just perfect. It has always been beneficial when a teacher has worked with me to help me do an assignment the way I am able to do it. Teachers could help students create these assignments to make a great learning activity each individual. Teachers know the learning material, and students know themselves. Put them together and you get a project that is not too hard, not too easy, but just right.

To conclude, I think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for the students to get their work done. Student-designed projects would be much easier on the students' break time, giving them the stress-free vacation they deserve, preventing them from procrastinating on their work. Along with this, no one knows a student better than themselves. We are all very different people, and with help from teachers and their knowledge of the subject, we can make a project just for ourselves that can help us really learn what we need to learn over the summer break. I think this is the best approach for summer projects, and it should be the way to go.
