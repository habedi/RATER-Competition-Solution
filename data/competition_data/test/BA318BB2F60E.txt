Summer projects are meant to help students rejuvenate their knowledge, and prepare them for the next semester during their summer vacation, which makes teachers the ideal candidates to design these projects. This is mainly due to Their vast wisdom and knowledge, giving them the advantage when it comes to their design. Secondly, is that teacher-designed assignments tend to be more challenging, helping students learn more efficiently. And lastly, is that teachersÂ know their students better than anyone else.

One reason why teachers should design these summer projects is because teachers, in general, are wiser and smarter. Assigning projects to students is a common task for teachers, thus, giving them more experience, and knowing what to assign. Another quality of teacher-designed projects is how difficult they are. Students need to be constantly challenged to maintain their efficiency, and assignments from teachers help meet that quota. And most importantly, no one knows a student's strengths, weaknesses, and skill better than their own teachers. Knowing what your students excel and struggle at can help you determine the trials they need to face; teachers are the ones who understand them the most.

Although others might claim that student-designed projects are more creative and friendly, Teachers are just more suited for the job. Due to their wisdom and knowledge, they have more experience when it comes to assigning projects to students. Teacher-designed projects are also more difficult, which challenges kids to study harder. And finally, the last reason is because teachers know each and every one of their students personally, helping them assign projects based on their skill.
