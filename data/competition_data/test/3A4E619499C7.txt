Dear Principal:

School policy should change so that only students with a grade B average or above can participate in sports and other activities. Three reasons for the new policy are that school is a place to learn, sports and other activities keep students from doing homework, and students in school activities should maintain a creditable grade so that the students who have a C average and lower can raise their grades and the school's funding.

Foremost, school is a place to learn. Many students need to spend more time learning rather than going out and playing. If students with grade C average were in sports that would not help them much with their schoolwork. Other activities might keep them from going to class. Some sports and activities even take students out of class, and students should not lose class time if their grade is a C average or less.

Next, other activities and sports may keep students from doing their homework. The students with a C average or less are the ones who mostly need to do their homework. Recent statistics have shown that 90% of students fail classes because they are unable to complete or do their homework. Sports and other activities usually keep students after school, thus preventing them from having their afternoon to complete their homework.

Then, the school and students will both be awarded if they have good grade. The student can have a better future for college with outstanding grades. The school will also be more recognized. Therefore they will receive more money.

Finally, the reasons for agreeing with the change of policy are that there will be better grades and good reputation.
