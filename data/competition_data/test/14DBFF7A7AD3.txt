Having a project to do over the summer is not ever any onesÂ favorite thing to do over break. Receiving a project that is student based is better then a teacher giving someone a topic they dont want to do. Summer projects should be student-designed because, the project would actually get done, it would be more interesting to student, and students would be excited to know they completed something they choose.

The first reason, is that the assignment would more likely be completed. If students know they could do a project and have it based on their topic of choice they would enjoy it more. They would actually prepare and do what needs to be done to get their assignment completed. Students would be more engaged in doing their own based topic rather than one based by a teacher. Also with giving students one based by them it is allowing students to express themselves.

Another point, is that the student would be more interested in doing their own student-based project. Student feels a sense of achievement when given something they can do on their own. They feel better knowing that they can come up with their own topics. Students will want to complete a project that they got to decide what to do or how to do it. They will also be interested in learning and doing what their project is about.

Final reason is, students would be happy to completed something they picked as their assignment. Students like to feel independent and doing something on their own can be rewarding and can help them in future events. However, others would agree that with a project being student-based the students may not want to take the effort to do it. Some may see it that especially since its over the summer it definitely wont get done. Furthermore, students would overall rather have a project that is student-based for them.

In conclusion, assignment given over the summer should be student-based so students will actually want to get the project done. students more likely to do the assignment, them being more interested, and being happy for completing something are all reason as to why summer projects should be student-based.
