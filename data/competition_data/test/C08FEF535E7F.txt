Most student's think that when you are at school its free time and its time to text your friends in class and just have an blast. I believe that students should NOT be allowed to use there phones in class. School is a place where you learn not where you sit and text your friend's. I believe that really and truly that at your age at least until your 16 that you don't need an cell phone. Its not a toy is not something that is there for you to take to school and play and show off with.

School is a place where teachers teach you about things that you need to know and your history from the past. First of all you shouldn't be texting in class because your cell phone should be left at home. Even if at school if your teachers is one of those kind who let you have your cell phone out that is not right. NO student should bring there cell phone to school because what if it gets stolen or your best friend knows your combination to your locker and just so happen to take it or maybe even give it to someone else. Who fault is that for bringing it to school, who fault is it that giving your locker combination to someone else?

You may think that it is okay to have it on you at school, but the minute it gets tooken up by one of your teachers or they see the imprint in your pocket and take it, you want to get mad huff and puff and be angry for something that you did. Its not time to text your friends in class and ask them what there doing. Its time for you to learn and not be worried about what other people are doing. Get off that phone sometimes and do your school work. Your phone is not important at school your school work is.

There trying to teach you about things that you need to know, but instead your worried about who's texting you. Most students don't need to be worried about that do your school work and be thankful that you even have someone to teach you things.

So i go with reason two if why students shouldn't have there cell phones at school. At home is where it should be and not in your pocket or in your locker. Once you get home them maybe you can have it. But Students are not focused on there school work, there always worried about mess at school he say she say things that don't concern school. That's how things get started school but electronics and the main thing is you cell phone. So again students SHOULD NOT be able to have there cell phones at school.

Not free time on, passing periods or even when the bell rings for school to be out.
