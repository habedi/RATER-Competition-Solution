To start most people think that persuading kids to participate in extracurricular activities is a good idea, I agree with this statement because their are so many extracurricular activities that students could be enrolled into. A lot of kids think that they dont have the ability to do some of the things that they might be interested in, but requiring participation will help encourage the students that want to try new things, try them. Kids need to be pushed into doing things that they might not of done on their own, this is why I think that enforcing the participation of after school activities are extremely important, their are many options/opportunities for kids to become enrolled in after school activities, this gives students to meet others with common interests, and persuades students to find more things that they might be interested in.

The first reason that I think that the schools should enforce the participation of after school activities is, their are many options/opportunities for the student to join an activity. Their are multiple things that the student can do. Some examples of things that the student can join include, clubs, sports, office helpers, advanced classes, electives, and many more. Including yourself in extracurricular activities as an extremely important life skill. This is extremely important because you will learn more about you self.

Another reason that I think students should participate in after school activities is, they will have an opportunity to meet other people with the same interests as them. it is important that kids spend time with people that have the same interests as them because, they will encourage you to have time to do the things that you want to do, they will also help you become better at the things that you like. You can make more friends and learn about some other things that you might want to try one day.

In conclusion, students will be better prepared for the future if they are forced to include their self in after school activities. I think that schools should enforce the participation of extra curricular activities because, their are many options/opportunities for kids to become enrolled in after school activities, this gives students to meet others with common interests, and persuades students to find more things that they might be interested in
