My school is the top school in America!!.. All the students at my school grades are no lower then a B average. Would you like to hear that about your school? You can. I agree with the principal 100% that students should not be allowed to participate in any sports unless they have a B average. It's good in so many ways. The students would work hard, many people would be passing, and the teams may win and strive to be the best. That's why I agree with the principal.

Maiden students would study harder. I say that because many kids at my school loves sports. On the other hand just loving sports want take you any where in life. So if those student really love their sport and would want to continue to participate then trust me so that they will actually do their work and take school more seriously. That would also look good on the school behave, if every single student in that school is making no higher then a B. So that's one reason why I agree with the principal.

In the second place, for those who play sports they wouldn't have to worry about if they would have to take summer school or anything because you know that if you're playing sports then you are also passing. Also this new rule might actually make student enjoy school and wanting to come for every reason. In addition if those sport minded people actually receive a good education in both middle school and high school then more collages would ask for them both academically and for sports. So then it will work out best for the students as well.

Lastly when those students play in the game they will probably be bring on their "A game". Only because they would feel though as if they work hard in the books, then they deserve to win. And if they don't want to be tired before the game or practice they might strive to get all of their work done in class. Then they will be happy to bring home the trophy and the report card with all A' s and B' s. That's the other reason why I agree with the principal.

So yes in closing statements this new obligation is a very good idea. For one our school would be the top, students would be passing all classes, and they will strive to be the best. So i' m so happy I wish this rule would go in affect today!!!!!!!!!...
