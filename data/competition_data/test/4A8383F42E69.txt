I think that the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enableing the computers to identify human emotions is'nt valuable at all. Especially not for students in a classrom. I say this because students moods in a classroom can change, in a matter of seconds because the teacher may give out extra work or it was a hard day for the student. Also kids don't always show their emotions.

Let's get a little bit more into this. I'm not completly sure why this facial exspression system seem's like a good idea. Maybe because the people who thought about it thought it would be a smart and great idea to know peoples emotions. If you can already tell by "facial" exspressions why need this machine system? It would be a waste of money to make everywhere.

People may show their mood by their facial exspressions but others might not. Some don't even show their emotions. Others may even have that natural "mean/angry", "happy/funny", or even the "sad/depressed" facial look.

This is why I think it would'nt be much of a good idea. It costs to much and might not even be worth it.
