Dear principal,

The idea kind of sounds unfair to others students that have D' s and F' s . I think kids with any grade point average or letter grade can participate in the sport they want to participate in. It would be really unfair to those who have the other two grades that can't participate in the sport they want to do for a school activity and for extra sports activity for their school to help support it in any way they can. Still students should have fun when they want to or not it would be fair to them if you just give us a chance to work hard and be healthy students that do whatever it takes to raise our grades to straight A' s or B' s and to achieve what we want to achieve. We want to fulfill our dreams and get a career like a teacher, pet doctor, doctor, designer, pet seller, or a famous singer/ dancer. One day we will have those dreams because of education and exercise. So let us have exercise when we have D' s and F' s at least we try so hard to get so far and at least we get somewhere in life when we are adults. When we look back we will remember the school that let us participate in sports and any other activity we want to support the school and any other kid in need. I almost fulfilled my dreams by exercise with my school and so far I am as healthy as a horse. I haven't been sick at least once in while but I am still hanging on to my dream being like my hero Michael Jackson. He inspired me to dance and sing like him and to never stop what you believe in. So no matter what grade health matters to us and the whole entire human race of the Earth.

Sincerely,
