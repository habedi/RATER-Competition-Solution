You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you will not only see things that almost everybody you know will never see,you can even learn things while your out there,like learn how to fish,take care of animals and you might even be able to learn how to sail your own ship. Not only that, you can even find a family and settle down and have kids,but before you say yes and sign up for this cowboy program that sounds incredibly awsome and jump on the ship and die for some super crazy reason,it won't be my fault. There are some dangers out at sea and I can tell you how to avoid them. Step 1,if you see some people come aboard from diffrent places try to stay away for a little because you dont know what kind of disease, or sickness they could have. Say you bring a little bit of medicine if you get sick and you become best friends with someone from China or Japan and you or him didn't know he brought a deadly disease aboard and if you catch it,your more than likely going to die, so keep watch if someone is coughing or sneezing. Step 2,Try not to get night watch,the reason being is that if you fall overboard there is nothing anybody could do for you because you will be out there all alone. One of the best things about the trip is that you get to go to new places and you can get new stuff. Like if you go to like Japan and all the other places you can get new plants,inventions,new farming products and many more. The best part is,you can sell it. In the story it says that he did because they sort of needed him and he wanted to help. If you do go you wil not only be helping other people you can be helping even more by bringing new ideas and farming products and you can even tell them how to properly farm or even how to farm. You will also help yourself in helping other people,even if it's just a thank you.
