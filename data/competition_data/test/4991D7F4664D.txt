"Is this a face created by aliens or a landform" many wonder. This specific picture of a so called "face" on Mars has captured the eyes of many. The picture that NASA has showen or released to us resembles a face like landform on Mars in 1976, but in the picture that was taken in 2001 clearly shows it was just a landform. Many people thought that there was possible life on Mars, but they are yet to discover if there really is. Many landforms like this so called "face" are found in the American West.

This "face" is just another theory that there is life on Mars.

Many people want to believe that there is life on Mars, so when the Vicking took the photo it just made them think that there was a greater chance of life on Mars.

There has been many thoughts on if this picture could really be a face or just a landform, but with improved technology NASA discovered that this "face" had occured naturally, not created by aliens. A face that was created by aliens wouldn't stick out as far as this natural landform, nor would it have stayed on Mars for over 30 years. Landfroms usually occur naturally, so who knows how long this "face'' could have been there when there were photographs taken of it , but then again it could have just popped up the day that Vicking landed there.

In 2001 they went back to see if this was an actual face or just a landform and with the higher quality cameras they could simply zoom in, which they did, and see that this was just a naturally occuring landform that formed over time. Naturally occuring lanforms happen over periods of time and that is simply what happened on Mars, it just happened to look a lot like a face.

In conclusion, this ''face'' is just a natural landform that formed over the years. There has yet to be life discovered on Mars, just landforms that have shapes of faces. Aliens did not create this face, nor was there an actual face in the Mars surface. There should be more pictures taken of this ''face'' so that it will prove that it occured naturally. Therefore, there are no faces or life on Mars surface.
