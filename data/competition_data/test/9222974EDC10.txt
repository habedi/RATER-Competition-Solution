The Facial Action Coding System improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of humans and detects how people truly feel even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Facial Action Coding System would be effective and valuable in reading emotional expressions of students in the classroom because;

Classroom computers would be able to know when they need to modify the lesson when they notice the students look bored or confused and that could make learning more effective to students. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". This shows how learning can be made much more easier and fun.

The facial action coding system would be effective in classrooms because it would make computer-animated faces more expressive when teaching. "The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery, most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication". Sometimes muscle clues might be wrong because sometimes people might not be able to indicate a genuine smile and a forced one but facial action coding system would be able to detect when students are happy and when they are lying.
