Now trust me I know projects are not exciting and having them in the summer sounds terrible, but what if I told you having summer projects could be fun. If you got to pick who designed your summer projects who would you pick: teacher-designed or student-designed? Having student-designed projects is so unique and a great way to make projects more interesting. How about we switch it up a bit and instead of teachers creating the projects students do. Making summer projects student-designed would make it stress free on students, give them freedom, and it would make learning fun.

I'm currently a high school student, so trust me I know how stressful school projects can be. If students designed these summer projects all the stress would go away. You would get to do the project on your own time and you'd get to pick what you want to learn about. Students wouldn't make the projects super hard or long because it is summer break and that's their time to relax. A teacher would normally give you a rubric or a set of guidelines you have to follow, but now you get to make it how you want.

The possibilities are so endless if students got to build summer projects. You'd be able to pick how you want to do things and you could really bring out your creative side. It's the students break, this is when they don't want to think about school, so they should be able to decide whats best for them. You wouldn't have a list of things you need to follow you would be able to do whatever you wanted to. This would be such a great opportunity for students to enjoy learning and make it interesting.

I know I've definitely gotten a topic to research about and it wasn't interesting to me at all. Having to do a project on something you find boring won't give you the motivation you'd need to push through it. If students got to pick what they wanted to learn, they wouldn't mind having these projects during summer break. Finding something to learn about that really interests you would make the experience as a whole ten times better. Maybe you're doing a poster on something you learned about in history, you get to enjoy learning about it and make that poster however you want to.

Student-designed summer projects overall sound like something that would satisfy every student. Having teacher-designed projects would most likely be more organized and efficient, but students would have more fun and enjoy learning if it was student designed. Lets make learning over summer break something everyone would enjoy while also being able to relax. In conclusion, letting students create their own summer projects would give them the break they deserve, but to also assure they are still learning.Â
