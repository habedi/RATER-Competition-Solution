I am more on the against side of technology, I feel technology is already bad enough to society. I feel this tecnology is just as bad as texting because its not acurate. In a text message you cant see the person so you never know what tone a person is texting you in. I feel this is a waste of time because we already have video call and facetime and these apps are more acurate than the Facial Action Coding System.

In this passage it states that by moving your muscles may not show your true emotion or face expresions, it just goes by how your muscles move in your face. This makes so much sene because we are all as humans have different musles, for example if a baby were to make a face expression and you mocked the baby your facial expression wouldn't exact turn out to be the same, which means your emotion could also be diferent when really it could possibly be the same emotion. In section 4 it states that humans have different ways to express themselves through different emotion, but then says these muscles can detect that, but if your not showing thee correct facial expression then the technology still wouldn't know your emotions.

In my opinion, theres enough technology in this world. Technology isnt always accurate either which could either be a good thing or bad. I feel we wouldn't even use this the facial coding system because society is so hooked on apps and facetime that they wouldnt even understand why they would need this app. Technology is overcoing society and is turning out to be a bad thing, these's barely any communication anymore or braceness when it comes to speaking out in front of people. The Factial Action Coding System is worthless.
