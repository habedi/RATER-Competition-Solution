Dear Principal,

I believe that you should choose Policy One because cell phones can be an important source of information. I also nurture a belief that they should not be used during class times because class times are for learning and understanding what is being taught.

It would allow time for students to get things that are on their minds out of the way so that they could focus more on learning during class times.

I look upon it as students would not be as tempted to text during classes. I hold an opinion that it would help students to center their thoughts more completely with less things that do not relate to class work on their minds.

Allowing cell phones to be used during lunch and other free times could possibly encourage students not to use cell phones during class and to wait until free time is available to use them. I do not feel that cell phones would be as big of a distraction if they were allowed during lunch and free times.
