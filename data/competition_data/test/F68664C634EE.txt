The idea of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities could be beneficial in many ways. Students could have the opportunity to meet new people, develop leadership skills, and find things that interest them. Being involved in extracurricular activities could be a very positive addition and quite an enhancement to a student's life.

Meeting new people through an extracurricular activity is one of the best ways to make friends, because everyone is surrounded by people with similar interests to them. For example, walking into the first day of a club they signed up for, one already knows they have something in common with the rest of the members, making that first conversation less awkward. In a situation where a student feels like they're often left out, or if they don't have many friends, participating in an extracurricular activity gives them more opportunity to make friends and put themselves out there. Being in a club or on a sports team is a great way to meet new people.

Joining clubs or sports teams is also a great way to find interests. A lot of people might assume that to join a club or sports team, one already has to have some sort of skill in that area, which is completely false. If someone wants to join the knitting club even though they have absolutely no idea what it is, but they heard their grandma mention her interest in it one time, and they want to have more things in common with their grandma, that's amazing. If someone wants to join the advanced dodge ball team having never touched a dodge ball in their life, but they just want to improve their reflexes, good for them, they have quite a brave soul. Finding the smallest interest in something at a young age could completely change someone's future and what career they want to pursue.

Developing leadership skills can be very beneficial to one's life. Being a part of the student council, being team captain, or being a club leader can really enhance a student's leadership skills, which is something that could come in handy throughout their entire life. Knowing how to lead a group discussion into making a positive decision is a very important skill to have, especially for a student. If a student just seems like another head in the crowd, developing some leadership skills is a great idea for them and they would really benefit from it. Leadership skills are best to develop in the younger ages because if someone develops them at a student level, it's safe to assume they'll be more successful at their future job than someone who never cared about standing up to something or was never able to propose an idea with confidence.

Enforcing the requirement of students being involved in extracurricular activities is a very smart idea. Students would get the opportunity to meet new people, learn more about themselves while finding what things they're interested in, and develop leadership skills which will be useful to them throughout their entire lifetime. Being involved in extracurricular activities would be a very beneficial thing to a student's life.
