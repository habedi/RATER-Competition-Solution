To the Principle:

I know that cell phones cause problems in schools because kids use them in class. Sometimes they have to text their parents if they are sick or something but sometimes it's just for the fun of it. I do think it is a problem and it causes a lot of distraction, not only for the person using it, but the people around them and the teacher also. I just don't think you should make a rule saying we can't have them.

One reason is because if a child is picked up every day and they need to know who is picking them up, they would have no way of knowing at the time. Also, if you are a bus rider, your parents might want to know if you are on the bus and made it home. Those reasons concern parents too, not just the students. Another reason i think cell phones shouldn't be banned is because if you say a student can't have it, some people take it the wrong way and they just want to go against it. Some of the kids i know would just bring it to school anyways just to do what they said not to. There are really a lot of kids like that. I personally don't use my phone at school because i don't want it to get taken up. I just use it after school because I'm a car rider, but i still don't want a no cell phone policy.

I don't think it would make things any better, and students would probably just be offended by it. If phones were allowed to be used on our off periods and at lunchtime, i think it would make students less likely to use them all day long. You see, if we get some privileges, i think it would be good enough and we could hold out on breaking the rules. There would most likely be a lot less kids using phones in class if we could use them some time of the day. So i say you should go with the first policy! These are all plenty of reasons why i think the first policy would be better. I'm not just saying this to get my way or anyone else's for that matter, but because i honestly think it would solve the cell phone problem better than policy two, the no cell phone policy would. I really hope you think it over and take my suggestion as some extra help. Thank you for reading!
