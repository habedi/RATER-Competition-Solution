The author presents their own opinion on why we should investigate Venus for human civilization. In each paragraph that the author writes, they explain in detail the pros and cons about the study of Venus. Using the knowledge that they have of the planet, many of the ideas that they present give the idea that they are determined to give us the reason to agree with him.

The first idea that they auther states is that Earth, Venus, and Mars are all very close in terms of density and size, and is very close in orbit as well. This leads to Earth sending spacecrafts to land on Venus to gain research on the other planet, but each time, the spacecraft only has limited time to gain research because of the harsh conditions. This gives the author a way of explaining the details of Venus in a descriptive way. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds with highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than Earth.

Even with the highly hostile environment, the author explains why astronomers are still trying to visit the planet. The author explains how Venus may have been like Earth in terms of nature. Their detailing explains how Venus was possibly covered largely with oceans and had the same ability as Earth by being able to support forms of life. The author also states that when Venus is close to Earth's orbit, astronauts can easily fly to it's surface and land.

Throughout the essay, the author explains the difficulties and how we can get past inhabiting Venus. He describes in many ways how landing on the planet can be beneficial for research and living conditions.
