Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you should start thinking about approving the policy stating that we (your fellow students) should be allowed our cell phone at school and at lunch hour, but not in class rooms. At lunch, it does not interrupt our learning environment because, it is at lunch. But i will agree with you that we should not have our cell phones in class, but I strongly are for the idea that we have them at lunch. I think that we could get along with them at lunch and then we will have less people bring them to class because we have already spend the time we want on them at lunch. I know this may not make sense but i strongly think that it will work. I know you may not even read this, but if you did i just wanted you to know what i was for. I even know that this letter regarding my opinion might not even make a slight difference of mind but i think that it might work if you just let us try it for a while. thank you for all you do for our school and for all the good teachers who try so hard to make sure we learn what we need to.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
