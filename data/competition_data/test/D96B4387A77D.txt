Everyone and even myself thought this thing was some kind of face created by the aliens. But all this is a land form on Mars called a butte or a mesa. Because it is not a face or an alien object it is just land formation on Mars.

First we all thought it was a face made by aliens from a monument. But "there was no alien monument after all after upgrading our cameras to get a better view of this so called "Face of Mars". Then after twenty-five years of looking at this thing for many years people thought through those twenty-five years that it was a sign of life of mars. On April 8, 2001 we got to the spot to were the face is and every pixel of that picture took that day proved that it was no face but a lava dome that is common around the West of America. A few people at NASA said that it reminds them of the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

All those years of hoping and trying to believe that there is life on Mars all just stoped after we all found out it was just a big land formation. Twenty-five years of making a camera better in every way imaginable just to take a sky view picture of a rock!
