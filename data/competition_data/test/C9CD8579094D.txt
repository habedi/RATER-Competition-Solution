To the Principal:

The school is changing its cell phone policy, and I believe the best decision would be to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during our free time. This choice allows us students to be able to call in case of an emergency, stay more organized, and enjoy our free time. After reading this letter, I hope you take my opinion into consideration because I believe I represent a majority of the students in this decision.

Having a phone means being able to communicate easily with other people, especially your family. By allowing us to bring our phones to school, we can be prepared for emergencies. A lot of things can happen during school that would require a call to your parents;

you could get sick, school could be let out early and you need to arrange for someone to pick you up, a fire could occur, or you could forget to bring medicine or an inhaler that you absolutely need. If you didn't have a phone, you wouldn't be able to get the help that you need quickly.

Phones aren't just for calling people; you can also use them as an organization tool. Make notes on what you need to get done or what classes you have homework in. With some phones, you can even schedule tests and events in a calendar or memo. We could also use our phones to plan study groups with friends before important exams. There are a lot of possibilities for using our phones in a way that is useful for us to do better in school, and keep up with dates and assignments.

Another reason why students would like to bring cell phones to school is to make the most out of their free periods. It's important for kids to not just learn at school, but to have fun. If we were to just have classes non-stop and not take breaks to relax with our friends, it would be even harder for us to pay attention and sit still. With phones, we can enjoy our free periods more. We can take pictures, text friends and family that aren't at school, and, with some phones, we can even play games to keep ourselves entertained. Also, we wouldn't be distracted with our phones during class because we would already satisfy our need to text and use our phones during our free periods. We would certainly follow the rules and put them away once class begins.

Being adolescents, we want to be connected with the world around us, and cell phones help us accomplish that. If you allow us to bring phones to school we would prepared for emergencies, be more organized, and enjoy our free time more. This change in the cell phone policy would help us in many ways, and we would really appreciate the trust you have in us to be able to allow us this privilege. Please consider this option, and keep in mind all of the wonderful things cell phones can achieve.
