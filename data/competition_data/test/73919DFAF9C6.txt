I do not believe that driverless cars should be legal. Cell phones already make us unaware of the world and what is going on around us, why would we lose even more of that awareness all because people are lazy.

This would be giving people even more time to be on their phone.

The quote from the article "All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." There are so many dangers of not having to pay attention to the driving, what if the driver fell asleep and didnt notice the alert? What if the car malfunctioned and didn't alert the driver?

This invention is accidents on accidents just waiting to happen.

Also the article states, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"

This car wouldn't just be bad for someone's safety, the manufacturers will be sued and have plenty of lawsuits filed against them.

I disagree with the use of driverless cars.

They are unnecessary and unsafe.

Electronics aren't perfect, phones that don't mess up haven't even been made yet, how can they expect people to put their lives at risk for something they can do themselves. They are an accident waiting to happen.
