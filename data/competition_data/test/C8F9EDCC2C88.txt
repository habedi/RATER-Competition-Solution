Venus, Earth's twin, the second planet from out sun. Why is it challenging to go and vist this planet? Studys has shown us that it is dangerous to go to and touch base. Why exaclty is that?

Venus is a dangerous place cause of the atmosphere, environment, and study of the planet.

There are many good reasons why NASA doesn't go to Venus. One is the atmosphere, Venus's atmosphere is "almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide" that goes complely around the planet. The most challening part is in Venus's atmosphere once you past the carbon dioxide is the "highly corrosive sulfuric acid."

Hot days are the best right, well on Venus the average temperatures are "over 800 degress Fahreneit." "Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system." "...and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater" than earth. The geology and weather side impediments, that there are more "erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes."Venus enviroment is greater then the deepest part of the oceans and it "would liquefy many metals."

How can we study Venus with out landing on the planet. NASA's is finding a possible a solution to study this planet up close, the big idea is a "blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape." We can avoid the unfriendly conditions by stay out of the way, at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be high around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and the air pressure would be close to our sea level. Its important that researchers cannot take samples of anything casue of the distance.

Venus is a place where we can't go to explore, for the reasons to be the atmophere, enviroment. The study has shown us that we can go to Venus, if we do it a way so we can make it out of there alive.
