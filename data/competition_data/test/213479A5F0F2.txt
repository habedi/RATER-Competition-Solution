Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home, basically online classes. I think students would benefit from having online classes from home, because, students would get more done at home then a student who goes to school for eight hours a day, and students would have more time to themselves, and it would really benefit students more, because students could get a full time job, and still get their school work done on time.

Students will benefit from having online classes from home, because, once students have gotten their work done. The students can basically do anything they desire, like, go on a walk to the park, go bike riding with the students friends, out to eat with their family, etc. Students get more of their work done this way, by simply having online classes from their homes. Students would most likely be less stressed out, if the students had online classes from home, to some students getting up early in the morning can be a struggle, also having to stay up late night doing homework can cause the student to have depression, or get drained simply by going to school and having to stay up late night doing homework and studying.

It would give the students more time to themselves, students could basically get up around nine in the morning, eat some breakfast, clean their room up a little bit, and by the time it is ten in the morning, the students would already be working on their online classes, in my opinion the online classes does not take very long. Mainly like three hours top. It would give basically the students, the rest of the afternoon to do anything they desire to do.

The benefit of having online classes from home, could really help the students out, the students could get a full time job, and still get their online classes done before or after work, as long as the students clock in the hours for their online classes, and they would be on top of everything, possibly even be happier this way. It would not take a lot out of their day, as much as a student who has to attend school for eight hours, and go to work for another five hours, and having to come home and get in the shower, and still having to stay up late night getting homework done, and studying for a test, only getting four hours of sleep and having to get up at seven and be at school by eight. It could cause depression to a lot of young adults our age, especially students in high school, and college.

In conclusion, having online classes from home, will benefit a lot of young students, because, students get way more done by having online classes, students have more time to themselves, unlike students who attend school for eight hours a day, seven days a week, and students could even get a full time job and still clock in the hours for their online school. More schools should give the students the opinion of taking online classes from their home, it would really help the students out a lot.
