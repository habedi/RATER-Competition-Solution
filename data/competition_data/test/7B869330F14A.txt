Dear Mrs. Principal,

The ideas that I would like to express is something private but I would like to talk about with you. The idea is on community service. A lot of people do it but many other don't. I think it is a great idea to do considering that we should do nice things to others. I really like the quote "do things to others as you would want to be done to you." This quote is golden. I think that many students should be required to take part in doing community service. I think that you should have a list of jobs that are available to consider doing in the next year or so. I also think it is a good idea to have an option of group work, meaning a group of friends can work together to do community service. I think that is one reason why many student don't want to attend in doing community work.

Examples that you should have is maybe helping out in our local soup kitchen for the homeless. We as in us students can help make, serve, and supply soups for the homeless and the less fortunate. This is a wonderful thing to do in my thoughts personally. Another example we can do is by helping tutor little elementary school classes. This can help by interacting with children and sparking our own memories from when we were back in elementary. Also my other thought was to have our own readings to children either in schools or in public gatherings.

Many student including my friends have told me that community service is just plain dumb and others have said it is a great idea. I have had to give lectures to those who think it is dumb. I told them they can choose to not like it but they don't have to make a big deal about it.

I think that after so many hours of service there is required then those who don't like it can stop and those who love helping in doing this can proceed to doing it as long as they want to.

Thank you for listening to my thought and complaints.

Sincerely,
