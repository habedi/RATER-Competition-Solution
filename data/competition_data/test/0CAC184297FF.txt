Some schools require students to complete a summer project.

In my personal the students should dictate the -summer project.

their carefree summer is being tampered with, so they should have some say in what they have to do.

To begin, the students need to enjoy their summer break.

In continuation, students know how much time they have to work unlike teachers.

For the finale, students know what they are capable of.

To begin, the students need to enjoy their summer break.

Summer break is meant to be a break from school, with the thought of a mandatory project ruines the fun of summer break.

With a project on there minds it becomes hard to just relax with the constant threat of failure.

In continuation, students know how much time they have to work.

students may go on trips during the summer and may not have time to complete a project by a teacher's design.

Students could schedule better if the students decided, their prior knowledge would be a deciding factor.

only they know what they have time to do.

For the finale, students know what they are capable of.

Some students may not have the means to complete a project.

For example, if the project is to go someplace a student might not have a vehicle or parents willing to help.

Students may not be able to multitask for projects.

In conclusion, the students need to enjoy their summer break.

Students know how much time they have to work unlike teachers.

Students know what they are capable of.
