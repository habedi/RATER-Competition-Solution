The new Facial action Coding System tells peoples emotions. I think it would be useful in a classroom. There is many reasons i think it would be useful. Im going to talk about why i belive it would be useful in this essay.

If you could tell how your students were feeling, it would make teaching easier. For example, if you were teaching and the computer told you all of your students were bored, then you could try to teach it in another way. Or if the computer told you all your students were exicted then you would know your doing a great job and you could teach that way more often. You would know what ways to teach to get the information into the students.

So what i think is that this computer could be really effective in a classrom. it would allow teachers to know if there students are even learning, how they feel about the way they teach, and lots more too. So if they could really use it in a classroom, im all for it.
