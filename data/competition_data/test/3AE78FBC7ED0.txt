Dear Principal,

I think everyone should donate some of their time towards community service. our environment needs to be clean every single day.

Community service should be a school rule that involves everyone. Some students litter and don't care if our planet is clean or dirty. Also, some students care so much about themselves, they don't want to help anyone in anything.

Helping others is great and can help you be a better person. Little kids need help in school sometimes and can use some of the students help. One can be a role model for them, and then that will make them be a better person. If we help our new generations be better persons, we might change the world into a better place to live in.

Another great thing we can do for this world, is we can help pick up trash.

Students litter sometimes and don't really care if we live in a dirty world or not. We can help pick up trash in groups or partners. This can be a fun activity rather than something boring which makes no sense to us. By picking up a few pieces of trash everyday, we can live in a much cleaner earth.

Please consider this and make this a school rule. Each student can donate a few minutes of their time to clean up our community and make a difference in this world. We can keep up the cleaning and the tutoring for better generations and a better world.
