I disagree with the principal about this because they should not make someone do something they do not went to do, and Finley they do not know if kids have something after school they needed to do. so this are some resonse why i disagree.

I think kids that get made to do something they will not went to do it. Like for anexple if i was getting made by my principal to do an extracurricular that i do not went to do. so if i did get mad to do one i would have been mad. So they principal should not make people do things.

Then finly, you do not know ehat kids have to do when thye get holme. Say that when i get home I have to leave aging because i ahve work or something elsa to do that is aparten. So if i had to do a extracurricval and i had to stay after school for it. I could not do it becaue i had something elsa that was inparten to do instead of staying after school for the extracurricuar i was made to do.

All this are resons why i do not think we should be made to do a extracurricular. Do you think we should not or should be made to do a extracurricular?Â
