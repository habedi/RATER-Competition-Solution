Dear Principal,

If you played on a team wouldn't you want to have good, honest citizens?

Why would you want to play with the people who get bad grades and invariably get in trouble?

I know I wouldn't want to.

To play on a team there should have to be only the people who get good grades.

I believe that if you are on a team that you should have to have good grades and a spectacular record.

One reason why I think people should have to get good grades to be on a team is because that way you only get the dedicated students.

I say that because if they have to get a B- average you better they probably have to work hard to be on the team.

That is a good thing because then they will be dedicated to their team and their school.

Also I think it is like that in college, all the super good athletes in college have to get good grades to play.

If they don't get good grades then they can't play.

It should be like that in middle and high school.

If the athletes want to be on the team they have to get good grades.

A recent study said that if a school has this policy the school's grade point average is 24 percent higher than school without.

That is quite a significant jump up and I think it shouldn't be ignored.

Another reason I think that we should do that is because then you get good all- around citizens.

If they have to get good grades then they are dedicated to their school. Also if the athletes play then they are dedicated to their team.

When or if the school changes that policy, I think we should also add that the athletes have to have a good behavior record.

That way they have to get good grades, be an athlete, and good behavior.

Add that up and you get an all-around good person.

I believe that our school should change that policy to a B- average.

That way they have to be dedicated to their school and their team.

Other people might say that you will get a smaller turnout.

Yeah, but that is a good thing because then you
