Dear Principal,

I think that ALL students should be able to be in sports because if not the rate of obesity will increase in our school because people that don't have a B and above won't be able to do cheer leading, track & field, football, basketball, swim team, or cross country. That would be very devastating to those who study but just can't keep a good grade. People that make C' s and bellow need to be athletic, to have a team to support them in whatever they do, to pray for them before a test or a game, to be by there side every step of the way. School is "One giant step for man, But one giant leap for mankind". By that I mean it's very hard to complete school when you don't have and athletic reputation to withhold, because your made fun of for not being in sports. Also if you made only B' s and up can be in sports a policy, then other kids would know that child doesn't have a good grade and he/she could be made fun of for that by more intelligent children. Trust me, I've been in that position before and it's not fun getting harassed for having bad grades or not being in the "right sport." It hurts, inside to know that someone else could have the nerve to go to someone else and make fun of them because there not "good enough". So please don't go through with this policy, because it could do more harm than help.

-Thank You
