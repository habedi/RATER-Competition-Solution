The Face is a natural landform,it is not something that was created by aliens. Aliens don't exsist so how could it have been from an alien. Mission controllers said that it is not easy to target Cydonia,it is hard work. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is landforms common around the American West. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because it is hard to find,it actually shows the Martin equivalent of a mesa,and aliens don't exsist.

The Face is a natural landform. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,so if there were objects in the picture you could see what they were. Each pixel in the 2001 image spamsa 1.56meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. It also says in the passage that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some people believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. Thats when mission ccontrollers decided to look again, and thats when they said, "Its not easy to target Cydonia, it is a lot of hard work".

With all this data that has been revealed people should think that its just a natural landform. If there was aliens that did this their markings would be other places besides just here. Even though some people aren't satisfied with this more things in the future can happen to make them believe this. Maybe if more pictures are taken then peoples thought of view with change. I believe that its a natural landform because its hard to find, it actually shows the Martin equivalent of a mesa,and aliens dont exsist.
