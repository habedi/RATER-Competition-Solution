The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" suggests that exploring and studying Venus must be done despite the dangers. They support this idea by stating how similar Venus is to Earth and that Venus could have been like Earth many years ago. They don't ignore the dangers though.

The author makes a point to mention the dangers of conducting research on Venus with statements like "almost 97 percent carbon dioxide," and "highly corrosive sulfuric acide in Venus's atmosphere." They still combat this with reasons to continue though with statements about how similar it is to Earth, and that it "could have supported various forms of life".

Venus could have supported life forms and we might be able to research them if we were able to get to them. The author brings up computers that are entirely mechanical. these computers could be build to withstand the intense conditions of Venus. It is possable for us to research Venus further but how many lives is that worth? Our Author did a great job at informing us, but they didn't give us enough reason to make it worth the risk to research Venus.
