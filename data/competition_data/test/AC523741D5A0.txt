How would you feel if you were required to participate in an extracurricular activity whether you wanted to or not? I believe that students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity unless they want to do so, therefore I disagree with the idea of students being required to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students should have the freedom to decide whether they want or don't want to be apart of an extracurricular activity.

First of all, I believe that students should have the ability to participate or to not participate in an extracurricular activity. I believe this because a lot of students may already be apart of extracurricular activities outside of school such as sports, music, dance, gymnastics, etc and having to participate in a school extracurricular activity could possibly get in the way of those activities taken outside of school, which could cause there to be no time for students extracurricular activities of choice. Which would be unfair if students would not be able to participate in what they actually want to do outside of school because of the required extracurricular school activity.

Another reason I disagree with this idea is because some students might not like to be apart of an extracurr-

icular school activities. Some students prefer to stay at home. I definitely have had times were I didnt want to participate in any extracurricular activities outside of school or apart of school for the reasons of school work already being a lot, watching my younger siblings, and just being a homebody. Also if I'm being honest a lot of students are just lazy and they don't want to be apart of anything they just want stay home, which is understandable. As well as some students may struggle with social anxiety and being apart of activities that require having to talk and socialize can be scary at times. I know that I've struggled with social anxiety and it can be really scary, and you just freeze up because your terrified of doing something wrong and that everyone will judge you. Also some students just may not be interested in participating in a extracurricular activity, they may not like any of the activities that are being offered so, it would be forcing students to do something that they do not want to do or be apart of.

Lastly another reason I disagree is because some students have their own responsibilities from home for example they might have parents/guardians that may be or do work late, so some students may need to watch younger siblings, clean the house, take out the trash, figure out what they will eat for dinner, go to their own extracurricular activity if they have one, get their school work done, etc. The list could go on and on. Therefore being required to participate in a extracurricular school activity could get in the way of getting those tasks done.

In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of requiring students to participate in extracurricular school activities. I believe this because it would be taking away students free time to participate in their own extracurricular activities, it would be forcing students who prefer to not do extracurricular activities to do extracurricular activities, and it would get in the way of students getting their own responsibilities done. So that is why I believe that students should have the freedom to participate or to not participate in extracurricular activities.
