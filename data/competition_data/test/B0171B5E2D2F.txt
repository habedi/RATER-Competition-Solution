Dear Principal,

I strongly agree to your new "B Average Policy".

I feel that many students focus too greatly on sports and not enough on academics.

With the new policy i think a change will happen in test scores and the schools overall grade.

Though I'm sure many students will be writing to change your opinion on the policy, I recommend you stay with it.

Mrs. Principal, many students are determined that they can make it into the professional league with his/her' s sport, but frankly the chances are very slim.

I feel with the new policy it will at least motivate them to do better in the classroom before they go out on the field.

If the school's average could go from a C to a B then the school could earn all sorts of awards such as most improved and most motivated.

Not only would this give the school a better reputation, but it would also nominate us in the county and state to receive equipment, such as new computers, Smart Boards and new text books.

All of this would be caused by the new policy too.

The possibilities of what the "B Average Policy" will bring are limitless.

I strongly recommend that you stick with the policy, and continue to urge students to do better academically.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
