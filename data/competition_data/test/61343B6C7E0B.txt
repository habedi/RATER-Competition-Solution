I highly disagree with the principle's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Most extracurricular activities are after school, since during school hours you're learning. Also, it's pretty unfair to force someone into doing something they're not so comfortable doing. Here are some reasons why I chose to not agree with the decision the principle is making.

For one, some kids get bullied enough during school, why should they stay after just so they can get bullied even more throughout the day? Not all teachers see or hear a kid being bullied, or when an individual bullies another. Which leads to it occuring more frequently. That damages a persons mental health. Being bullied will cause a person to degrade themselves, the person being bullied may even start to bully others, and it could cause the person being bullied to develope some sort of depression. Being bullied is one of the leading causes to suicide. When an individual has depression, it makes them tired or weak. Causing them to lose focus and forget about the work they're doing in class or maybe even lose interest in trying. Then, they'll have all this work piled up, have to stay after school to play a sport or help out with the yearbook, which will put stress onto them, and that's not a good thing. When people get stressed out, they could get sick or have heart failure from their blood pressure getting raised to a certain extent.

Another reason is that, a lot of kids struggle financially. Some people might not have a way of transportation from school to home. Most parents work throughout the day while their child is at school. People have to make money, and some jobs won't just let you leave. A lot of kid's parents may get off work around 4 or 6pm, but what about the one's that don't get off work until 8 or 9pm? Yes, the school provides transportation with buses, but they only go through certain routes. If your location isn't near your buses route, then they drop you off at a local gas station or store. But, what if you aren't fortunate enough to have a family member come pick you up and bring you home? Some people aren't as lucky.

I can see it now, people will start skipping school if the principle doesn't give them the choice whether they want to stay after school or not. I'm pretty positive that a lot of parents might make the decision of putting their child into homeschooling or choose to put them in a private school, only to do what's best for them and their child. Students willl tend to be more rebellious, just to skip their extracurricular activity or get kicked out of it. Making it to where there's more people who will be in ISS, more distractions in class, making it to where we can't do our work, and the teachers will be piled with stress due to their students rebelling against them. It'll give the school a bad name because of the number of kids getting in trouble, making the school look really bad. Most kids don't even like attending school, what makes you think they will want to stay after for a couple more hours?

However, I do believe there are better solutions into getting kids to participate in extracurricular activities. Teachers could try to motivate kids, you could find some well known influencers to try to influence the student body, and also, there is the solution of giving them a choice. I still believe it would be a bad decision to force people into staying after school. I'm aware they have a choice in what activities they could do, but forcing them to pick something isn't okay. Think of what the students want, think of what's best for them. If you tried to motivate the youth, they would be much more easier to cooperate with.Â
