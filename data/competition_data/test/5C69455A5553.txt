Waking up early for school every morning can be difficult for many students, but imagine being able to do school right from home. Many students and their families are used to being sent to school but think about them being able to receive the same education they would get at school but instead receiving it at home. There are some schools that are starting to offer online school for their students instead of having to physically attend classes at school. Being able to have the opportunity to take online classes can be beneficial because it allows for less distractions, it allow for a more flexible schedule, and it allows space in schools.

In school there are classrooms filled with students that can sometimes cause distractions. For example, if an assignment is due at the end of class and many of the students are talking or messing around the assignment won't be completed like it was supposed to be. Working with lots of noise around can interfere with the progress a student makes on their assignment. By taking an online class from home this reduces the chances of a student to get distracted which allows for their work to be completed. For instance, if a student is trying to take a test and there is a lot to other kids laughing and being loud that student may have a difficult time taking that test. It very important to be in a quiet environment when taking something like a test, if there are distractions it can effect the results of a test. Many people enjoy a place where they are able to think and if there are to many things going on they aren't able to do that, that's why with online school students can be in a quiet comfortable environment with no distractions to take their tests. Being able to be in an environment with no distractions can benefit students greatly.

Taking online classes from home can give students a schedule that fits them. An example is, when students come into school early in the morning they are tired and are falling asleep in class. When students come in tired they are unable to focus or pay attention and they won't learn anything. If doing it online students can do their classes at a more appropriate time for them while still completing their mandatory hours for that day. Another example is, say a student has a doctors appointment and misses lesson in class . When attending a school there is a specific time that students have to be there and if they need to go to an appointment they could miss a lesson and fall behind. If they did online classes they wouldn't miss a lesson, they could go home and do it after the appointment and not fall behind. This gives students a schedule they can move around if necessary and it wouldn't effect their progress in school.

Every year schools become more and more populated to the point that there are to many students. For example, if there a class filled with students and there only one teacher it can be difficult for that teacher to try and help everyone. When having to many students in one class it can be difficult to find time to help every student that has questions, which can negatively effect their grade. If school allowed students to take online classes it would benefit both online students and students that attend a school because it lessens they school population allowing those students to have more time with teacher and the online student by giving them more time as well. Another reason is, schools spend so much money on getting trailer or other spaces to teach students. This is a lot of money that is spent on something that can be fixed by offering online school. Offering online classes can decrease the population by a lot which mean that schools won't have to keep spending money on trailer, but instead spend that money on something better for the students and school. By having this option is can fix the overpopulation and help schools save money.

The schools that offer online school benefit because it allows less distraction, it gives a more flexible schedule, and it allows more space for schools. Some people might prefer students to attend a school but other might find the online schools better for students. The materials learned at home would be the exact same as material taught in schools. Schools should consider offering online classes to there student, schools might be surprised on how much it can improve both them and the students.
