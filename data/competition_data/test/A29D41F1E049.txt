Dear, TEACHER_NAME

While being a student at SCHOOL_NAME,

I feel that only the students who are getting into trouble should be the ones who are doing community service because I STUDENT_NAME, think it is unfair to punish the students who are doing there work and are not being childish and are acting like educated students who don't deserve this punishment.

There are many discussion's with the teachers and principals, but there are many students who are doing there best and are prepared to learn. So when talking to the teachers at meetings I feel that some of the teachers should pull some students aside and ask them how they feel. With my opinion I feel that this is the best way so that all the teachers could understand us as students feel.

I think it is very important for all the students who are bad to do the community service so that the next time they will know not do be bad again. This is a very hard decision being a student but i feel that it is unfair to punish the students who always do good and give no trouble.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
