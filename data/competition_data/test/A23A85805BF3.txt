In the text it states that Venus is the closet planet to Earth terms of density and the size and occasionally the distance too. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% of carbon dioxide, and even more challenging Venus clouds are highly made of corrosive sulfuric acid. On the planet surface Venus have average temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

The author also states that Venus has a atmospheric pressure of 90 times greater than planet earth. The conditions of planet Venus are far more extreme than any ohter humans ecounter on earth, it could even destroy a submarine because the pressure is very extreme. Nasa states that they will have to build a vehicle that could handle the extreme pressure of venus and the conditions also. Finally, Nasa would have to use the old technology that they used in WW2 and the moon landing.
