I agree with this statement because if students were to participate in sports, they would be more fit and active. I agree with this a lotÂ because i used to not really do anything in gym but then i started running and I noticed how fast I run so I kept doing it and i go a little bit skinnier and a little bit faster.

Working on the yearbook is also something i'd agree with because it could either make the student feel good or wanted and that goes for any extracurricular activity. Im pretty sure that if you help working on the yearbook you probably get to edit some of it in your own way.

Serving on the student council is a good thing to do because you're serving them food and its also a great thing to do because it makes you feel happier and makes them feel blessed, thankful, and boost their moods. Im kinda used to this because i worked at a homeless shelter and i had to feed the homeless people and almost every single time i served them food they'd always feel so blessed and thankful to get the food.

I think another extracurricular activity is reading because your doing something you don't normally do. But I think students should read to get more knowledge and grow a bigger imagination because I remember i read diary of a wimpy kid books back when i was 11 and it made me feel more positive about myself, made me accept who i am, and especially made my imagination grow a lot.

These are all of my reasons why I agree with the principal with participating in at least one activity.
