In some schools, summer projects are assigned to assure that students will continue learning well after the school year ends. Although students should continue to learn during their break, some have argued that if the projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed is the better option because students will have more options to chose from, they can do a project they're interested in, and teacher-designed projects are annoying to produce.

Many teachers would complain that students won't have any directions to follow on their projects and will thus not continue learning during their break. Although, students not having any directions on how to make their projects is true. This can be viewed as a purely subjective point, since this'll give students more freedom on how they want their projects to be. Another point of discussion is is that students won't continue to further learn during their break. This viewpoint that students won't continue to learn is wrong due to the fact that students will be learning while creating their projects.

Having more options for students to choose from is great because students can create a project of something they're interested in with high effort. In the past, teachers would only give students one option for a project idea; therefore, limiting the chance of something that student would interested in and lowering the effort. For example, if a student was given the freedom to write about a certain sport they're interested in, they could make a well informed slide show to present to a class or could talk forever about their favorite team in a podcast. A student would choose to write something they're interested rather than having to read a long book than having to write a big essay any day.

Students can make projects more enjoyable is a valid point because it can show their creativity. Since students won't have any directions on how to make their projects, they can be as creative as they want. They can try out new ways to present projects like showing a cool infographic or make a fun video that can inform a class about a topic they worked on. This could make the actual work process of the project more enjoyable to the student and whoever they're presenting it too.

The third reason why student-designed is the better option is because teachers can make projects annoying for the students. Teachers can sometimes make students go out of their way to work on their projects. To include, teachers can make it so students have to visit somewhere to get information to further continue working on their projects or make students have to buy certain books to write about. This may not seem so bad at first glance; however, for some students who go visit out of the country for the majority of the break can be a nightmare for them. Imagine a student being gone for the majority of the break just to come back and only have a little less than week to visit a musesum and write an essay about it. This situation shows how teachers make projects annoying for these types of students.

In conclusion, a student-designed project is better because students can choose what they want to talk about, projects would be more enjoyable for everyone, and students won't have to go out of their way from teacher-designed projects. Having more freedom in options leads to students picking something they're interested in.

Students also show their creativity thus making it more enjoyable. finally, teachers make students go out of their way for projects; therefore, making it annoying for some students who travel.
