I think its valuable and there are a lot of reasons why I think that. One reason why I think that is because it can tell you how other students feel. Like one example the Facial Action Coding System can tell the type of mood.

Another reason why I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for use students they can problaby read a lot of the facial expressions, in the text it said" And how can a computer recognize the the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel!"

Another reason why I think its valuable is because it also said about the FACS , that some guy named Eckman, creator of FACS in the passage said that "Eckman has classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness- and then assiciated each with characteristic movements of the ficial muscles." Thats another reason why I think that.

Well these are why I think the FACS is valuable in a classroom. To me the they could also read any person expressions, emotions or feelings.
