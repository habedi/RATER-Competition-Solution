First off I don't think there are a such thing as aliens so i don't think that would be the case. Im here to tell you guys and ladies that this is a natural landform built from rocks piled up and all around each other. If you think the aliens did it how could they have done it if it's sticking outside the ground instead of inside. As you see in the pictures when the years go by the cameras and pictures get better asthe face structure starts to disappear and it makes it look like a bunch of rocks. They don't know if they actually seen a face they said it was winter on that side when this picture was tooken. So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras when they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but i would see why you would think that. It is kind of weird to see other things like this on other planets that don't even have human life or something close to it for this to happen. You should have already known it wasn't a face when JPL web site said it wasn't and it was just a natural landform like all the other craters.
