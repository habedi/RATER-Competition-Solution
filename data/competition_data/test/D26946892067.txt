Dear TEACHER_NAME

2/2/11

I was regarding your ideas for allowing or banning cell phones at your school. The policy that I think would be best is allowing the students to bring their cell phones, but they MUST be turned off during class time. They may use their cell phones during only free periods, lunch, or before school (if the student is on campus), and as long as they are not a nuisance or used in any inappropriate manor.

This policy could make coming to school a more exciting thing for students, and could make them more motivated to learn. Technology is a big thing that students enjoy using, and they would be allowed to bring there enjoyment to school. Another good reason why this policy would work so well involves the student's parents/guardian. If a student has an accident with there clothes, then they could contact there parents, and ask them to bring them a pair of clean clothes, (with office approval of course).

Cell phones can also help new students that have cell phones, so that they can keep in touch with old friends, or relatives, and they will be able to have someone to talk to at their lunch. They won't just have to sit around by themselves, and they won't just have to sit their without talking to anyone. This policy is also a way for students to make new friends, and they are able to exchange numbers and to keep in touch, or to hang out with after school hours. Cell phones can also help students that enjoy doing there homework at free periods, and then they can check their work on the calculators provided in most cell phones.

In conclusion, the policy to allow cell phones at your school is the only right choice for you to make. It can help make new friends, make coming to school fun, and can help keep students in touch with their parents and friends at all times. This policy is can also help the new students who never really enjoy coming to a new school, but in some ways, they can still keep in touch with their old friends. I hope you consider my choice, and use this policy for your school to keep your students learning, while still having fun when they come to school.

Sincerely,
