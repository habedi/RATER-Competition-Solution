You should participate in Seagoing Cowboys because you could help countries in need. After World War two, 44 nations came together to form the UNRRA(the United Ntions Reliaf and Rehabliitation Administration). They needed people to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Thats when the Seagoing Cowboys began. Also, thats when Luke and Don signed up. Here is why they did.

Luke and Don signed up because it was an opportunity of a lifetime. It maybe a liftime opportuntiy for you. You could see cool things just how Don and Luke saw Acropolis in Greece , Europe and China, and taking a gondala ride in Venice, Italy. It opened a world to Luke. It also made him aware of people in need. You would love the oppportunits that it would give, just like it did to Luke. You could meet families thats just like yours but they need help and Seagoing Cowboys would be able to help them.

Taking care of animals and seeing great countries is a good reason to go be Seagoing Cowboy. You could go on great adventures and see things you never imangined seeing. You should be a Seagoing Cowboy to help people in need and take care of animals. The world is so big and a lot of people need help. Sign up to be a Seagoing Cow boy.
