Mars is a planet in our solar system. Have you ever wondered if there was life on it? I have. Mars is a long way from our home on Earth. About 25 years ago NASA found a landform that looks like a face. NASA has researched this landform ever since they found it. Some people belive that the fae has to do with some typwe of alien or live activity on Mars. I'm here to tell you differet.

Life on Mars. Does that sound like a logical explination to this "Face"? If there were life on earth, wouldnt NASA have found it by now? You have to have water, food, oxygen, to live. There has been no proof of any of those things. Say there were aliens living on earth. Would that make a difference in how we lived? My opinion it would. There would be different things, different looking people maybe. You can not live without water or oxygen. Oxygen is not on Mars or in outer space. There has also been no proof of water on Mars either.

The article says that for almost 25 years, NASA has been looking for proof on what this thing is. If Someone were to say that aliens lived among us, would you believe them? I know I wouldn't. Aliens are things created to scare us. Maybe there are such things are Aliens., maybe there aren't. We will possibly never know the truth.
