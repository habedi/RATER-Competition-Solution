World War II is now over in Europe. However, many countries still need help to recover their food supplies, animals, and alot more. A Seagoing Cowboy's job is to help take care of and ship cows, horses, and mules to these countries. There are many reasons more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. We would be helping alot of people and get to see amazing sights.

One reason more people should join is that we would be helping people. Many of the countries were left in terrible condition and need us to help them out by bringing animals over. The people joining would also be helping the Seagoing Cowboys. The Seagoing Cowboys need help taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls. Bales of hay also need to be pulled up from lower holds of the ship.

Another reason more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that they could see amazing things in the countries they visit. It is an unbelievible opportunity to see Europe and China. Seagoing Cowboys also get to see amazing sights in Greece and Italy. Such as the Acropolis and taking gandola rides.

Some people say that they would not like to join because they think we will not get any freetime and we have to work the entire time. Yes, we do have to work but we still get time for fun. Especially as we return from the trips. We get to play baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis. We also get to fence, box, read, and play other games on board.

In conclusion, it would be great for more people to become Seagoing Cowboys. You would be helping us and other countries, get the opprotunity to see the amazing countries, and still get time for fun. More people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
