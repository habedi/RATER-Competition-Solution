In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author claims that Venus is a worthy planet for us to examine more closely. Venus is unihabitable and its impossible, with the technology we have today, for a human to step foot on venus. So why does the author beleive its a good idea to send humans to study this dangerous planet?

I beleive the author supports his idea that studying Venus would be a good idea very well. Although Venus is uninhabitable and dangerous for humans the author shares many solid facts that throughly support his claim. For example the author states in paragraph 4 that "it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system." The author also shares that Venus may have once supported forms of life. I beleive these two facts alone could spark interest in the reader and get him/her to want to know more about whats on Venus. In paragraph 4 the author also states that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. I beleive this fact supports the authors claim very well. Not only does the author provide facts that sparks the readers interests he also provides logical ways and evidence of how scientists can get humans to Venus. In paragraph 5 the author says "NASAÂ’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray" meaning NASA might be able to create a vehicle that can float above all the dangers of Venus.

Despite the dangers and extreme conditions of venus the author still supports his claim with logical facts and resonable ideas. I beleive he supports his claim very well.
