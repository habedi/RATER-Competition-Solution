If you participate in sports you can make your full time job and make a lot a money . Because sports is grind to get into and its takes a lot of hard work . A hard pays off if you focus on what u want to be like if you wanna play basketball you have to work hard and focus you make it if you dont work hard and focus if you work hard all the time and try you most likely will make it where you want to be .

The yearbook i dont really know about but im going to try. The yearbook is more of a thing to do for fun because you can take pictures of people and more. You can get more time out of class and go around the school and probably get one for free . And after you get all the pictures you can go print them out put them in the book.

If you serve on the student council you can help new people around the school. Also help people in other class rooms with stuff . Make sure that kids stay out of trouble and dont get suspend and make sure they clean up be hide themselves and keep them away from bad.

I think its ok to do sports because yo can go to the pros . If you work hard on the yearbook you could you could get your own for free. if u do good as student council you will most likely get principal list and get rewardes.

what do you think about my promt?
