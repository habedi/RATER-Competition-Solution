I think this artical is important. Our emotions are always changing. This new technology can help us in different ways. I'm for this because learn how someone feels is important in some cases. Facial experssions show how someone feels through their emotions.

The creator of FACS is an psychologists named Dr. Paul Eckman. The Facial Action Coding System is able to read an identify peoples emotion. Only the six basics which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust ,fear , and sadness. The way they found Mona Lisa's emotions was by using a 3-D computer to construct the face. They found all forty-four major muscles, the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit on the computer.

If the FCAS was used in school it can be a benifit to students and teachers. It can show how student are acting in class to see if they're under standing or not. If someone isn't understanding then the teacher can see and talk more on that subject. If the students id doing an assinment on the computer and get the answer wrong and see confusion the system could reword the question and see if that's easier.

The main idea of the Facial Action Coding System is to see emoition. It can help in many situations. In school we can now see if student are confused or paying attention.
