The word "Summer" brings a lot of feelings of excitement. Kids across America know summer to be a time of freedom, and a break from school. Recently, some schools are requiring students to participate in summer projects. These projects are used to continue student educate year round, opposed to the regular school year. Some schools feel the need to determine the project for the students, instead of allow exploration into interests. Other school allow for schools allow for student-designed projects, in which students are able to form their own project, and delve into what intrigues them. I believe student-designed projects are more beneficial to education because, they would be relevant to student interest, and allow for creative exploration;teachers must check student-designed projects for educational content.

School can feel like a rut,however, summer can turn that rut into a mountain of good feeling. Some topics covered in the classrooms have no benefit beyond the test, and a teacher-designed project would be no different. Most kids don't appreciate being forced into any sort of work, especially during their months off, so providing a predetermined project would not peak a students interest. If something isn't interesting to the student, are they truly learning? allow students to formulate their own project, and plan it out would create a better passion for education, and their summer work. When students find their work relevant, they work harder, and in return learn more. Since learning more is the whole goal, I see a clear argument for student exploration during the summer months. When students are left are able to pursue their interest, you will find an increase in creativity.

Everyone likes to picture themselves as a free thinking, and it can be hard to channel that in a traditional high school environment. Allowing students to investigate their passions will result in increased creativity, along with better work. As they begin exploration into their projects, they will feel better about the whole working over summer idea. With their own interests at the heart of their projects, students will be able to come up wtih more creative,and innovative project ideas. As the find themselves deeper in their left hemisphere, they will be faced with increased problem that will be unique to their situation. Since all students will be completing personal unique projects, they won't be able to rely on others for direct solutions to their problems, which will increase problem solving skills. With increased student freedom, comes the downside of noneducational content.

Students may get a little off topic with their first attempt at a student-designed project. While I believe student freedom is important, I also feel their should be strict guidelines to maintain educational value. Since summer is a time for students freedom, all students are going to search for the easy way to avoid work during their break. It's the heart of our nature. This can easily be avoided by guidelines, and teacher approval on their proposed project. Teachers must find their investigation education, and discover the value in their topics, while allowing for an open mind, not to control students. Teacher approval will allow for the educational value to be present, while allowing students to explore their interests. This balance between education, and freedom will maximize summer project learning potential.

Education is a fine line between interests, and true value. summer projects are meant to increase value, but teacher-designed projects can weaken interest. No students likes following the same instruction through the school year, and keeping that procedure during summer projects would be painful for students. They would not find teacher-designed projects relevant, which would lower interest in their project. Without interest, students would lose educational value through teacher projects. Student-designed projects are the happy medium for summer work. Student-designed projects would better educate because, they would be relevant to student interest, and allow for creative exploration,however, teachers must approve students' projects in order to maintain education value.
