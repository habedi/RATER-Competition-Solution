I kinda do agree with this problem. Tech can tell whats everyone mood is at at the moment and i also agree on you can read on people faces if they are upset or something. Tech tells you how to handle your problem and tell you what you should do. but, face emotions can speak louder than words and thats true. also wehn people take pics of each other, that show it all as well. there are many ways that your emotions can be shown not just by phone and other Tech. People try to lie about there emotions and sometimes, that can lead to life risks. If that person really sad then and always upset, then that person might think something that you dont want to see. over the years, people is scared to tell other people what they think or what they should do. Some people dont relized that other poeple can help that person that is going through something that they should be going through. everyone shounld think about the bad stuff and always should think about the good things. now that being said, computers can read other people emotions and i believe it should give them tips to forget about whats going on.
