Do you care about our Earth? Human's actions towards the earth don't show that they care about it and how they're ruining it. We are destroying the Ozone Layer! One huge way we can prevent this is limiting the use of cars. By doing this it will take more stress off of you. It will also be more safe on the roads with less traffic! Most importantly, we will be saving our earth.

The first reason I believe it will be a good idea to limit the use of cars is taking stress off of us. We all have bad days, between work and school. Imagine just being able to hop on a bus that will take you to your destination. You won't have to worry about any bad drivers. This way you can just relax. Lets face it, we all get a little road rage every once in awhile that will even cause you to drive a bit crazy.

This leads me to my second main point which is less traffic! Some city's have a lot of unwanted traffic! If we limit the use of our cars and use the train we will get directly to where we want to go. Perhaps we use a bus, there may be many bus's on the road going different places but this will still be better than all the fuels we burn and put off into the air that is destroying the Earth.

My final and most important point is that we are destroying the Earth! We are damaging the Ozone Layer! If we cut out all of our vehicles and just have a few buses and trains for each city then this will help our earth and ozone layer very much! All the smog being put into the air is not good at all and it's not healthy for us humans either!

In conclusion, limiting the use of cars will help the earth and us humans in the long run. All the smog we breathe in and the damage it does to the earth is not good! We can help prevent this by limiting the use of cars and bring back buses and trains for our main way of transportation.
