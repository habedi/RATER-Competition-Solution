I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to help people and visit many different places while on your trip.

For me joining the program was a great opportunity.

You were never bored, caring for the animals during the crossing kept me busy and on return trips we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Besides helping people, I had the side benifet of seeing Europe and China.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy made me more aware of people of their countries and needs.

Thanks to being a Seagoing Cowboy I lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

I beleive that you should be a Seagoing Cowboy because you can benifit from it in many ways and you have a fun time doing it.

You get to help people and you get to visit places that you haven't been to before
