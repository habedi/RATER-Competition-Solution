Let me tell you what advantages you got when you limit your car usuage. Well first which everyone can tell you is that you save so much money. Second you can just ride a bike or walk so you can stay in shape. And last not using alot of fossil fuels leaves less air polution for the world. Those are just some advantages you got when limiting your car usauge.

Well the first advantage when limiting your car usage is you save so much money. How much is gas these days per gallon? 3 something? And when you add that up it ends up to be alot of money to just fill your tank up. And to fill your tank up its like forty to fifty dollars depending on how much it takes to fill your car up. And an average person fills there car up close to 1-2 weeks. So in 2-4 weeks you could have spent eighty dollars on something else like grocries, your girlfriend/boyfriend, maybe its someones birthday, bills anything than just gas. Thats one of my advantages to not driving.

My second advantage to limiting car usage is you can just ride a bike or walk and you can stay healthy that way and in shape. If you think about it, when you fill the car up it gets close to around 200 miles you get to drive untill you run out. Instead of paying forty dollars to fill the tank up you can just buy a bike and ride that 200 miles and you stay in shape. And if you really want to save money you can just walk and its for free. Not only is it free but when your walking for longer than 10-20 miles which i doubt youd be walking that far but it really keeping you shape also starts burning those muscles and gets you stronger.

My third advantage to limiting car usage is the less fossil fuels you burn the less air polution your letting out into our world. And those fossil fuels that your buring and releasing into the air, it is really bad for our world. When first of all our fossil fuels arent really that renewable. And second its just bad to have that just going through our population. Where everyone is breathing in all that air polution and making people sick. Its just really bad to be burning alot of fossil fuels, when theres many alternative ways you can be transporting than driving a car and burning fossil fuels.

In conclusion, i just told you three advantages to limiting car usage. One, you save lots of money, second there is alternative ways for transportation like riding a bike or walking and staying in shape, and third when you burn less fossil fuels it leaves less air polution in our world.
