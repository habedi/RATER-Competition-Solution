Dear principal

I think you should let us kids bring our phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times because what else do we have to do we talk to our friends at lunch anyway plus it would be a lot quieter in the lunch room and if there turned off in class you would not have to worry about us using them anyway. Plus if we where to use them in class the teachers would take them from us and turn it in to you then our parents would have to come get it and we would be band from bringing it to school for the rest of the year that would work to i am positive that it would. Even if you do not make that a policy we will text during lunch and class anyway so either way where still texting it's a wining situation for us that is but not so much for you a very good time to let us text would be in the morning during tag because we don't do anything in tag anyway except for Tuesday Wednesday and Thursdays.

But still we have Monday and Friday to text in tag but we should get to text during lunch everyday because all we do is eat and talk anyways and that's my final decision to the policy.
