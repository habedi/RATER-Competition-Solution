When the word summer comes to teenagers' minds, fun or sun is a common thought. Summer vacation is time away from education, but many schools require completion of projects over the break. The purpose of projects is to assure the continuation of learning. In order for students to maintain increasing growth, schools must consider the best form of education over the long-awaited break. There is controversy over whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. For the best form of educational progression, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience, the projects have more structure, and academic performance increases.

Many people would argue that student-designed projects would appeal to other students better. Teenagers gravitate towards making friends through shared interests and ideas. Although the shared bond of age may seem like a reason for students to understand each other, everybody is unique in his or her own mind. The student that designed a summer project for a whole class may find that assignment more interesting than the others do. There is no guarantee of appeal for everyone in the class because of the various personality types in the world. Student-designed projects focus on what the creator is interested in, while teacher-designed projects tend to think of what interests the majority of students. Educators have been exposed to the different personalities they have taught, so they have an idea of what would equally appeal a class as a whole.

For the creation of a summer project, teachers have more experience with a wide-range of students. Whenever teenagers attend school, their objective is to achieve an academic diploma while maintaining a social life. They have not considered how all of their peers think and learn. Teachers are trained to create lesson plans that suit most of the students in a school. All educators need to obtain a degree before they can go into the workplace. Most of them have completed a course of psychology or sociology to better understand the behaviors of young adults. With years of experience academically and in the workplace, teacher are more likely to succeed in creating a project that fits a majority of students.

Teacher-designed summer projects would have more structure for an easier learning experience. Along with academic and behavioral experience, teachers need organizational skills. They are well-adapted to a learning environment and have a multitude of deadlines each week. Educators become more aware of the average pace an assignment can be completed within a variety of students, which leads to a better determination of the workload for a summer project. Also, teachers are given a curriculum for a course at the beginning of each year from the school board. They can take into account what pupils need to know to be prepared for the following course. The information learned inside each course can be adjusted for what teachers think will help students succeed in future academics, while allowing teenagers to complete assignments at a reasonable pace.

An increase in academic progression occurs when projects are teacher-designed. Educational performance in students holds a high level of importance as statistics are recorded then reviewed each year. Schools are constantly looking for strategies of improvement. Teachers have access to more resources that can be provided for completion of the project, while student-designed projects solely rely on the creator's background knowledge of the subject or research online that may not be as reliable. The success rate increases for learners as the projects utilize the information needed in the future, rather than excess knowledge that is not useful. An expansion of achievements requires teacher format rather than student creation.

The making of teacher-designed projects improves academics as the experience level is higher in teachers, assignments contain more organization, and success increases within students. Teachers have workplace experience with different types of behaviors, so they can create a project that will interest many students. Also, educators plan out a reasonable workload for students to complete while including entertainment. With the high amount of knowledge and resources teachers have, students can reach a greater potential of educational progression. Teachers are the most selfless people as their career is to help others grow without much incentive. When people advocate to maximize educators' training and experience, by having them design assignments, it will assist society in building a better future for later generations.
