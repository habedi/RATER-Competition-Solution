Luke in the story " A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves " went on a program called the Seagoing Cowboys program which took cowboys on a trip to places all over the world to take care of the animals. Luke could not pass this oppertunity and sighned up. After coming home repoters are asking him questions about his trip.

The first reporter asked Luke " why did you go?"

Luke replys with " Well it had so many experiences and, I thought I would have many oppertunities and showed me places I had nevver been to and Don and I had the time of our lives."

The next reporter questioned me " What oppertunities were in the trip "

I answer with " Well I thought if i traveled places I would at least get some gift or somthing remeber it but we just kept sailing, and get some jobs in the other contries which happened I am going to move Tokyo, China next month to be a worker for the main amazon. com factory. And I was happy doing Seacowboys program if you get the chance to do it.

The thrid repoter asked me " Do you get the same food and shelter as the others"

As I answer my mom calls but i ignore it and she thinks I am dead.

"Yes, we were treated the same as the pilot even though we had to take care of the animals we were treated as humans."

While my guard stands next to me and says it time to rape it up and I say " Sorry guy I have no more time to stay buy.
