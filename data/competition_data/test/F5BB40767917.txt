Dear Principle,

Students should be allowed to use phones during free times at school, because if a student is sad and doesn't have any friends they would possible want to talk to a family member they could just call on there free time not during class and talk to that person reducing there sadness or anger. If they couldn't be able to talk to no one they would be mad and take it out on someone else causing fights. Students would be more focused on there cell phone instead of drama and fights going on and possible using cell phones during school would reduce fights and complications in the school.

If a teacher takes a students phone away because they were hiding it just to use it at lunch it would just cause more problems and also the principle doesn't need to have to worry about that stuff, you have enough problems to deal with as it is, you don't need another one as simple as just using cell phones in school. Also students wouldn't have to try so hard just to be on there cell phone. They wouldn't have to worry about when to try and sneak to use there phone, instead they could be worried about there school work as much. Also if students was talking on there phone and sneaking around school to use it they could get in trouble or miss there class either way kids will still want to use there phones. So I think they should make an agreement instead of someone not getting what they want and doing something else causing to get in trouble.

If it was an emergency at home and couldn't wait and the student couldn't pick up there phone the situation would have been worse. Plus students if they were lost in a school and in danger they would need something to contact an adult. The world is always coming up with new technology that children will just keep using and the cell phones would have upgraded and more interesting to kids. So you the principle should consider that the school should have a cell phone policy saying that students can use there phones during lunch and free times.

Sincerely,
