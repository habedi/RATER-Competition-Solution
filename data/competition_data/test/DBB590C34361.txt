Going to school from home sounds like one of the greatest ideas to think of. There's no getting dressed or rushing to avoid missing the bus because all of the school work is online and can be done at home. It seems like a smooth and easy process. However, it could be very tedious, and for some, impossible. Students would not benefit from online classes/ classes at home because they they might not have the means to purchase a device to be able to take said class and because they can easily get distracted at home rather than at school.

One reason why students would not benefit from taking classes from home is because they might not have the money to purchase a device to do their work on. For example,some children are not financially stable at home, therefore they wont have a device to use to complete their tasks that they are assigned. This would mean that they would have to travel somewhere else to access a computer to do their work. Doing that defeats the purpose of the classes being at home because the student would have to go somewhere else to do the work. It would be smarter to attend classes at school because they provide you with electronic devices to complete your work on and there is no worry about purchasing a device to do work on.

Another reason why attending classes from home is would not benefit students is because it gives students a better chance to get distracted or procrastinate. For example, when most students come home from school, they watch TV, eat a snack, or take a nap. If students took online classes, they might end up getting distracted by the TV or eating. Some students also dont complete their homework at home because they procrastinate so much that its too late to do it. Attending classes at home just gives the student the opportunity to be lazy and complete their tasks only when they feel like it. Taking classes at school would be easier because students would not be able to get distracted by the TV or procrastinate as much and more work would get done rather than if they were to do it at home.

Some will argue that taking classes at home is beneficial because it eliminates getting ready for school. They might also say that it's easier because work can be completed at any time the student feels like completing it. However, some students might not be financially stable, and the only way they eat is when they're at school. Online classes could prevent some students from getting their well needed meal. As for the other reason, most jobs run on a schedule and have specific times that they prefer things to be completed. Coming to school will help equip students to be prepared for a job because at school, students run on a schedule and are expected to have things completed at a specific date just like a regular job does.

Attending online classes from home is not the best decision for many reasons. However, attending classes at school helps expose students to the world and to new things that they wouldn't be able to observe if they were to be at home everyday. It also helps students to adjust their lives to get ready for the "adult world" and to successfully obtain a job and be great at it. Also, As mentioned before, there's no hassle to purchase a device to complete work on because in school, all those things are provided for the student.

Although it would be nice to relax at home and take online classes, the smarter choice would be to attend classes at school to avoid procrastination and to avoid spending unnecessary money.
