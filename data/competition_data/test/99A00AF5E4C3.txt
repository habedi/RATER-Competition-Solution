Making the right choice

Dear. Principal,

I think that we should not have any community service because like it takes up like way to much time. Like kids have a lot of homework these days and you want us to do our homework right? And also a lot of us kids have sports that we are in and we don't want to miss a game because we have to do community service like no. Also, kids want to hangout with their friends too because we love our friends. Doing community service takes up way too much of our time and we have better things to do in our lives. Other adults can do community service its not that hard so i don't see why us kids and teenagers have to the community service it should be the adults since they think they know everything. If you want us to start doing community service it is just going to take up our time so its not fair because we have lives too and we need to get our school work done and like study for tests. If you make us to community service i know that a lot of kids wont do it anyways so you cant have it your way sorry but you cant so either way your not going to get your way.
