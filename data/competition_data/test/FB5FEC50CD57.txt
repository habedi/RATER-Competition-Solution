Generic_Name is an intelligent girl who really enjoys learning, however, going to school is not something she looks forward to. When PROPER_NAME is at school, she is a victim of bullying and it distracts her from her assignments in the classroom. Considering her situation, Generic_Name's parents decided to remove her from the toxic environment of her current school, and enroll her into online courses she can take from home. Many students are in the same situation as Generic_Name, and find going to school hard because of fear of the way their peers treat them. Although public schools provide the social aspect of student's lives, and allow them to communicate and interact with one another, many students would benefit from distance learning because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus.

As many people know, bullying is a huge problem plaguing schools all over. It takes place in schools everyday ,and many times goes unnoticed by teachers and staff due to the fact of students concealing their bullying tactics from authority, and making their victim stay silent in fear of being treated worse. These situations make it extremely hard for students to focus in class and complete their work. Bullying also makes students afraid to even go to school, which can cause them to skip and fall behind. Distance school however, gives students the opportunity to work from home, taking online classes or using video conferences to learn material. It helps the many students who experience bullying by eliminating the problem and creating a safe space for learning and creativity to take place.

Secondly, not all students work at the same pace. Many different factors contribute to the way students receive information and the speed at which they complete assignments. Some students just naturally work faster and online classes would allow them to complete school at a quicker pace. Then, there are also the students who work at a much slower pace, and need extra time to process and comprehend information without feeling rushed by their peers. Also, students who are heavy in sports, or already working jobs are often overwhelmed, and online schooling would allow them to create their own schedule based around their activities, while still staying on track and not falling behind. Whatever the situation, the option for students to take part in online school allows them to work at their own individual pace and tailor their curriculum accordingly.

Lastly, public schools are usually not the most ideal learning environments. Disruptions are frequent and they make it hard for some students to actually be able to focus and complete assignments on time. Also, behavioral problems and fights are common in public schools, and make many students uncomfortable. Furthermore, public schools often lack healthy learning environments and make focusing especially hard for students who have specific learning needs or already have a hard time concentrating. Taking classes in the privacy, and comfort of ones home is a good solution for certain students who struggle with focusing, because the environment is familiar and essentially better suited for learning.

In conclusion, many students would benefit from distance school because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus. If more schools offered these programs, bullying rates would decrease, students would have better success in learning, and students would have more excitement when it comes to school instead of stress. All in all, more schools should consider offering online courses to accommodate students, and make school a better, safer, and more successful place for all.
