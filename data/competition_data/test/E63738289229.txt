Do you like going to a lot of new places? Do you like unique places? Do you like seagoing Cowboys? will today I am going to tell you something you might like to join it is seagoing Cowboys. The fun part is that you get to do all the things that you might of what'd to do like visiting a lot of unique places.

So we are going to enter view a person his name is Luke bomberger he crossed the Alantic ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War Il. But before all of this happened he did not know what he was going to do with he life he had 2 jobs and one of the jobs he .worked with he's friend. He's friend invited him to go Europe on a cattle boat. Luke he couldn't say no because he knew ' it was only in a lifetime thing'.

But if your not a rise taker you probly should not take this job because luke he broke his ribs and he couldn't work for almost a month. And he almost slid off the boat and if you didn't know he could of died how crazy is that. But not only that but you have to be resonspable because Luke had to care for him self and for the animals and had to change there cattle. But if I think about that I could not even do that job Icant even barely take care of my cat and puppy at home . Not only that Luke's animals were not the size of a kitten or a puppy they were cows, horses , and prolly even goats.

But if you really want this job you have to be all this 6 things 1. Caring 2. resonsable 3. reliebole 4. heping 5. Rise taker 6. *You have to know what challenge you are going to be up to*
