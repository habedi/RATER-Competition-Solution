Dear principal,

I think that kids participate in sports with less then a B average. I think this because then the kids are going to get fatter. My next reason that kids have to have fun in school. Another reason is that also they might not come to school because there not participating in sports. Those are my reasons

Firstly, I think kids need to participate in sports with less than a B average is because they might get fatter. Kids sometimes do not go do sports after school and need it in school. Also the cafeteria food is fatting and kids eating it and not doing sports there going to gain weight. Another reason is that half of the kids in every school is obese and if there not doing any sports more than 3/4 of the kids in school will be obese. Also if kids don't do any sports when they get fatter then the school is going to get sued for to much fat people in school and illness of a child.

Secondly, that kids have to have fun is school. When the kids have fun when they play sports. That makes the school a better place. Also kids try to be kind to one another to have fun and that also helps the school be a better place. Also sports can help them makes friends and that helps the kids a lot. Another reason is that when kids do sports they simply fell better that they can do something good.

Thirdly, kids might not come to school if they don't have sports. Kids may skip school just to play sports. Also kids might not go to school because they have no fun. Also kids might skip some classes to do sports with the people that have over a B average. Another reason is that might do bad in school because all they do is work and they want to do sports.

In a nutshell, those are my reasons. Because kids might get fatter. Because the kids want to have fun. And because the kids are going to skip school for sports. that's what i' m writing to you about
