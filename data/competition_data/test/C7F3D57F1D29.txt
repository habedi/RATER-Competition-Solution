Unmasking the face on mars is a cool story, but if i was a scientist at NASA discussing the face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens i would tell them its not created by aliens its just a natural landform thats is on mars.

Im not just saying this to say it but what i figured out is that eighteen long years ago after the viking missions ended. That the face that they found was important to the taxpayers. I also found out that the face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it was winter in april, a cloudy time of year on the red planet.

so my argumentative essay to the people that believe it was created by aliens well its not because when michael malin and his mars arbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, releaving a natural landform there were no aliens monument after all.
