In the artical " Making Mona Lisa Smile," tells about a techonlogy called the Facial Action Coding System, which is a system that tells peoples emotions from a degital screen. When knowing this technology can read faces, may it be possible to read amung students' emotion in a classroom?

Facial Action Coding System is a "3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human mucles". It has to move all of it's muscles in the 3-D computer to determind a facaial a human is making while using the facial gagit. We come across basic emotions like sad,anger, happy, and more that this gagit says can can pick up when scaning peoples faces, through the Facial Action Coding Systems. It even says in phargraph 3 "Eckman has cassified six basic emotions--- happiness, suprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness--- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles".

When Knowing that, i dont think the mushcine could tell the students' emotion in a classroom. I only say that because, the Facial Action System can always make a slight mistake on judging how someone in that classroom feels. Just think, yes people can see others faces and make thier thoughts on what the person maybe feels, but also sometimes their judgment is wrong. I know the acticle tells me, and the other readers "Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facaial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect Yet Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facaial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions" (in pharagrah 5). I still say it doesn't matter about the studies someone has done to, or on something, technology can make simple mistakes just like humans.

In parapraph two, you can even see the author asking the readers, "Can we actually "cauclulate" emotions---like mathe homwork"? Then goes on with saying, "And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel". When saying that it just shows that the author, and probly others that have read this acticle isn't sure about this facial computer tool, looks can always be desiving so it hard to even trust technologys judging something simples as someones facial expression.

Some people just may think the Facial Action Coding System is a very great idea, and some may not think so. It's just to hard to get a good answer on whomevers feeling it's the right technology to use. This technology could, or couldn't help others determind someones facials in a classroom.
