Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I honesly think that we should all get out there and help other people in need. And I think that every single person should have to do it. Everybody in this world can always use a little bit of help.

If there is one or two people that do not agree with this, then maybe they are just a little to selfish.

Because I'm sure if next time they need help, and someone goes " Oh, sorry I don't have time." or " Sorry, I just have to much to do right now." They wouldn't be to happy. Everybody can get out there and help one another out.

If this world didn't take time for other people it would be a complete mess.

Even if you took a couple minutes out of your day to go out and pick up trash, or help the elderly person that lives beside you. Or help out at the animal shelter. Just for a couple hours, or not even that a day would show people that you are willing to help when they did help the most.

People that go to Elementary schools and help with little kids and help them understand more of what they are learning or even teach them new things can always be used. Specially when people reach out a hand to help a child or person that is disabled or maybe is just a slower learner. Sometimes, people don't know how much just a simple little thing can mean to someone.

Walking a dog for someone that is to old or can't stand to walk that long is always helpful. Or even mowing the lawn for someone that can't or has health issues, and can't get out there and do it themselves. All of these things can always help. And plus, it's nice to know that when you need help, you can find it. I think that every single person should get out there and give a helping hand. Every single person has had someones help, someone that was willing to take the time and reach out a helping hand and help them. So we can always give it back. Even some of the smallest things matter the most.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
