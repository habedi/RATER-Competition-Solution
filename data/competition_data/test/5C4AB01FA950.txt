Technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Technology to read emotional expressions of students is not valuable because the software is not compatible with all generations of computers. It would cost a lot of money to upgrade all computers for schools around the world. Technology to read expressions is also not valuable because in the passage it explains how the technology can find ones hidden emotion. That is invading privacy because they are hiding their emotions for a reason and maybe they don't want to be bothered and a teacher may try to talk to them about it.

Knowing ones hidden emotional can be invading privacy but it also has benefits. The benefits could be for identifying ones anger that has the mentality to inflict harm to someone or something. It could also alert the teacher because there could be a disturbance. He or she could pull the student aside incase they cannot handle their emotions or have a panic attack. The software could also prevent fights and agruments because the teacher would see the students emotions and help. But that still does not stop the fact at the end of the day that is an invasion to privacy because sometimes emotions are suppose to be kept on the inside. Last but not least the pricing becasue in the article it does not give price but the software might cost and it would still cost money to upgrade school computer to get the software.

Although the technology has benefits it should still not be used. Even though it has value it is stll not worth it price wise and the invasion of ones privacy. At the end of the day every school does not have money. It could also be a safety problem becuse student will feel like they're being spyed on. Not just by the teacher but the government becuse the government is attached through many softwares.
