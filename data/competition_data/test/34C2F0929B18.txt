Dear principal TEACHER_NAME,

I think policy number one is the best of the two. I do not like policy number two because it is way to strict. If we had that I think it would be a lot less fair.

If we had policy two it would not bother anyone. Everyone would be very happy with that decision. The phones would really not bother people at a lunch period and also at free time when they can do whatever they want.

On the other hand a phone could go off in class and disturb everyone that is trying to there hardest. Also it could get them in a lot of trouble for bringing there cell phone out. It could also harm them and there education and they will not learn that much.

I think that cell phones should not be allowed in schools. It is just a disturbance to everyone that is doing there school work. All the kids that disturb the class with there cell phones should get a detention. Students should be able to carry them but, they have to be shut off or in there locker. That would be just fine I think and when they get out of school they can do whatever they want on there phones.

I want everyone to go to your principal and see what you can do about your cell phone policy. You never know you could change the schools mind and be able to use cell phones at lunch periods. Maybe you could get a more strict rules if you are getting disturbed by peoples cell phones everyday. Again I do believe that cell phones should be allowed in school and used at lunch periods. Cell phones can also be used for emergencies. If you get hurt or sick you might need to call your parents to come pick you up.

Thank you Sincerely,
