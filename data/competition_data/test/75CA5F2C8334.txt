My fellow citizens, some advantages of limiting car usage is that its better for the earth  and reduces the greenhouse effect.

Also there wont be as much smog and there will be a lot less pollution in the air.  Limiting the usage of cars can be a better for you. not using a car can really benifit us.

People use cars everyday for everyday things.  If people cut down on the usage of cars and took the bus or even rode a bike to work it really could help the earth.  Less cars means less of the greenhouse effect.  Less of the greenhouse effect means a better world.

Billions of people driving cars can really pollute the earth.  Paris had to ban driving because the smog was to great and needed to be cleared from the sky.  The smog was so serious that if you didnt leave your car at home you would get a fine.  almost 4,000 people were fined.  Beijing, China is one of the most polluted city in the world becouse of smog.

If you dont take a car you could walk, bike, or skate witch could be fun.  If not then you could always take the bus and still help of the earth.  If you didnt take a car to work then it could reduce traffic.  Some people enjoy riding a bike instead of a car because it reduces stress and also reduces pollution to the earth.

Limiting car use is not only good for you but also good for the earth its self.  there could be less greenhouse effect and smog.  Lets all help and limit the usage of cars.
