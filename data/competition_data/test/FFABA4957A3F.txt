Dear principal,

I am a very concerned student. You are thinking of changing the sports grade policy. I and fellow students disagree and think this is a very bad idea. Changing the grade policy on sports would enrage both young men, and women. You would be taking away their encouragement to go to school. So for the sake of the school and your view as a good principal listen to what I am about to say.

By changing this policy a good percentage of the sports players would be kicked off the team. Students who no longer can see their favorite player(s) perform would be disappointed and there goes your school spirit. Also sports players would not do their work to try at what they think is get back at you, some may even go to the extreme of dropping out or transferring. The students who do the unthinkable and drop out would ruin their lives without even knowing it and you would be partially to blame.

The players who stayed in school, well their dreams of becoming a athlete would be crushed without them even getting to pursue it. Most of the players would become out of shape for their feeling of the lack of need to play or exercise anymore. By that act it would cause overweight minors or obesity ,later causing health issues.

These health issues conclude, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart problems, angina pains, and trouble breathing during little physical activities, caused by their over eating caused by being emotional. These issues cause depression, lack of interest, and or mental lapses. So please take this under a very serious condition. This one mistake can ruin lives dreams and agility's. Thank you for your time.

sincerely,

A very concerned student
