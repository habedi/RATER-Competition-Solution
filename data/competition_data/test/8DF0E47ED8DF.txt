Driving with a phone isn't always a bad thing, sometimes people have a valid reason to be driving with their phone and aren't always trying to just goof around. Like, for example, when I drive, I have to use my phone whenever my mom or dad call me or I have to call my mom to tell her if I have practice or not after school.

Most people don't have newer cars that have built-in GPS, or even a touch screen which means they have to use their phone if their driving out of town and need a GPS or need to use their phone to contact a friend or family member to make sure there in the correct places to get where they're going.

Last year during soccer season, I had to call my mom in order to let her know if our practice was ever cancelled or ask her to bring me food before the game, which meant she was using her phone while driving home after work, but was for a good reason. My mom has an older car that has a touch screen put into, it but she still has to take her eyes off the road to answer the phone on the touch screen which is just like using her phone, so what's the point of her not being able to use her phone?

The average cost of a 2018-19 car is about twenty to thirty thousand dollars and even though they come with a built in touch screen, the average American can't afford a newer model car. This means they get a touch screen built in, if possible, but even using a touch screen can be as distracting as a phone. This shouldn't make people who have to use their phone a bigger target than someone who is using a touch screen who could be doing ever knows what. So using a phone while driving shouldn't be something worthy of being pulled over for.

True texting and driving seems bad and is the cause of about every car wreck. Most people still text and drive, but they focus their attention mainly on the road when driving or they use it while at a stop sign or on an open road. Texting while driving shouldn't be seen as such a big deal as long as you're at a complete stop while driving due to the fact that you can't always pull over to somewhere safe to use your phone if you're heading somewhere new for the first time.

Over all, texting while driving isn't something you should always do, but shouldn't be something you be fined $50 dollars for. If anything, it should just be at most for the first offence $15, and after that $25. Everyone has used their phone at least once while driving since the hands-free law was passed. Most people who didn't follow the law were probably using their phone for something important, others maybe not. But, when texting and driving, you should always be aware of your surroundings and try to use it when you're at a complete stop or able to pull over.
