What would make the students feel about attending classes from home, instead of school? Students attending to class everyday early in the morning can be stressful. Especially if students don't normally attend; their attendance can effect their grades. They will not learn from anything by the distractions that are going around in public schools. It is best for students to stay focused and concentrated to be successful. Otherwise they will not learn the education they need.

Homeschooled can be the best option for students. The reason why, is because there isn't a schedule to follow. The main important reason about home school is that the students will stay concentrated and should complete all assignments in a less distracting environment. Students will not have to stress over load of work because there will be plenty of time to be able to complete them. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers.

Students complains about having to do homework for one night and not having enough time to complete them. Homeschooling will allow students to work on their own pace. Students sit on a desk for 6-7 hours everyday. They have limited of time for eating and using the bathroom. It will make the students feel pressured about the rules. Such as how to properly dress for example. Homeschool doesn't have any rules to worry about other than students getting their studies.

Public schools can be very difficult to handle as a student. There are bullying, physical fights, accidents may occur, and also on lock down that isn't a drill can be very dangerous. Students should go to school just for the education and have to not worry about any problems. Students should feel safe at a public school. Homeschool should be the safest environment without any worries or problems.

Homeschool is for the benefit of students to pass all of their exams and to also have good grades. Students are staying on task on every assignment that counts. Students should feel comfortable without any rules involved. Public schools and home school are similar, but home school is nothing but getting your education. Home school should be the best option for students.
