I do not believe in driverless cars. Driving is something we look forward to. Once we get our license and can drive all that hard work is paid off. If computers drive for us then what is the point of having to wait?

I believe that if we, humans, have computers do everyhting for us then what will there be for us to do? I happen to really enjoy driving. If computers drive for us then who knows if there will be a maufunction and it wrecks without warning. While the author did say that the car alerts the so called driver if there is any need for human help, how will it be able to tell if it is a cunstrustion site for sure. Or what is the road changes? I don't think driverless cars are a smart idea. For example; most states in the US have laws against it, for our saftey. We should know that we can't count on computers to work 100% of the time. How many times a day does your microwave stop working? Or how many times do you have to reset you wifi? If we can't count on machines to bake our food for us than how can we count on them when we are putting lives at risk?

I know that there are some precautuions thatg can be taken to avoid this, but it's not worth the risk. Computer modified cars are helpful, but there should always be a human driving. While, most car accidents are human errors just think about how many times the driverless car will wreck until we have a perfect one. I just don't believe that it is worth it.
