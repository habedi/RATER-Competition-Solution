I think this 3-D computer software that can recognize emotions can be used very good because we could tell if somone isnt happy and when there mad ,it can be used for students when they are confuse or bored in school.

This computer software can help kids that are falling into depression not fall into it how? You could use it on them and see if they are depresse and they could recive help from adults. This can also let you know when someone isnt in the mood such as being mad or sad.

This 3-D

software can also help kids in a classroom. It can be downloaded in your computer and you could be reading a passage and your confuse,it could make the lesson modify and make it less confusing on the student. It could also be used for video games or video surgery.

This is why i think its a good idea to have this computer software because it can help students in school if there confuse or bored ,and it can help kids when there depresse and mad or just not in the mood.
