Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My opinion on the cell phone policy is that students should be allowed to have their phones out during lunch or other free periods. This would be a better policy because this way, students may text or call their parents if they need to talk to them about getting a ride home or bringing them lunch to school. No body wants to have to go to the office and wait to use the phone just to call their parents when they have a cell phone in their pocket.

Students use their phones at school anyways so its not like the no cell phone rule really works. Students text during class all the time. A lot of kids just got to the bathroom when they need to call their parents instead of going to the office and waiting. No body really cares about the no cell phone rule, they just text or call anyways.

I think students should be allowed at least to use their phones during lunch or free periods. I can see how it is a distraction during class time but if its recess and you need to text your mom or dad to tell them that you are going home with a friend, or that you don't have basketball practice after school, then I don't see how that is a problem or distraction. If students phones get stolen then that's their fault and their problem, not the schools.

I think you should really consider changing the rule to cell phones are allowed during lunch and other free periods. I don't see how its any problem. Students use their phones anyways but now, they wont have to hide it during lunch and recess. If someone's phone goes off during class, or the teacher catches them texting in class, then the teacher may take it away and I understand that, but at lunch and recess, I don't think the cell phones should be taken away. It is no problem or distraction or disruption for student to use cell phones during recess time. Any time other than that is not acceptable but lunch and recess should be allowed!

Thank you for reading my paper and I hope you consider my opinion!
