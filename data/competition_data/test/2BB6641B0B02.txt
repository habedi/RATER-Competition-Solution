Dear Principle,

I am writing to you today on the topic of community service. Some kids think it is a good idea, others a bad idea. Some kids think it takes up to much of their time. Others think that it is a good idea. I think that all students should be required to do at least some community service. Some kids helping in elementary school are helping kids understand what they are learning better and so they are making this community a smarter community. Others pick up litter. That helps the community keep clean and save the environment. We could have other kids sell lemonade or drinks or snack food. That could help raise money for the community to buy things for our school like playground equipment or books. Other people could help out at the library sorting books and putting the back on the shelf. That could help people get more books from the library and learn about other places around the world.

There are even more ways to do community service then what meets the eye. For people who play sports. They could organize for example a soccer game to raise money, or a swimming meet. They could practice their sports they play while helping to raise money for the community. Or if they are good at art they could draw artwork and sell it to help raise money. Community service doesn't always have to mean that people aren't having fun. So all in all, i do believe that kids should be required to do community service.

Sincerely
