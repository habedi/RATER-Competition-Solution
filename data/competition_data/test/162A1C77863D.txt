Why are driverless cars a good idea and why are they a bad idea? I think driverless cars are both good and bad ideas. I think they are a good idea because they can be very helpful to people that have a certain type of disabilty. They help with the camera when you are backing out and have a sensor if you are getting close to something. Like in the BMW it has many different funtions in it. It alerts the human driver when a situation occurs and when there is an accident or work zones ahead. Thats when the driver has to take control of the vehicle. The car also has flashing lights on the windshield and other heads up displays.

Even though many people like it, the question is if there was an accident who's fault would it be. I think it would be the car manufacturer's fault because they were made to be able to do all that stuff with all the technology in it. Even though everything has a problem with it, if it is a driverless car I think they should make sure it has zero problems with it before they let them go out for people to buy them. It cannot be the drivers fault because they are not driving it they are just sitting in the seat and are sipposed to be trusting the car.

In all thoughts i think the driverless car would be a great idea if it was guarenteed zero problems. Also even though it would be really expensive I think other car places should give them a try in the future.
