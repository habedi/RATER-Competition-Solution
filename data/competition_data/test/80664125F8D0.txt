Dear TEACHER_NAME

I believe that we should not have a B as a grade, to be able to try out for a sport. I know that you think were smart, but not every student is doing very well in there class. Now i have an c in two of my classes so that would mean that I wouldn't be able to try out for the sport i would like to play. Now if i was in your position i would announce that they would have to have a C or better to try out for any sport that we would like to play. Even though i like soccer i would get out my house and go to the park every two days, just to practice for this years soccer team coming up in March. Again if i was in your position i would add this rule if you were to change the grade thing. If any kids that were in a sport got into a fight, referral, or got in trouble in any way then they should be suspended a game each time they got in trouble. But if you were to keep that policy the way it is and you happened to see improvement from your students , then keep the rule the way it is. IT will not just be better for them ,but for the school district. Now TEACHER_NAME i would consider you to not change the rule and to keep it at a C average so we could have an enjoyable time at school.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
