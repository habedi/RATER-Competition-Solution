The idea of not having a car is quiet unsettling. Think about the palces you have to go and how far the are. Wouldn't it be a disadvange to not have a car? Would you believe me if i told you there is a suburban area that has little to no cars in its area or a specific day cars are banned for 24 hours? how about how much cleaner the air is over there? The amount of space and walkway in an area like that, would that be a pro or con for you?

People all over have participated in local events where cars are banned for a day, like Paris and Colombia, and some want to get rid of it completly like Vauban, in Germany. In Vauban, its a "car-free" zone. Living in an area like this without a car is alot less tence without all the extra of cars. acording to Heidrun Walter "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." supporting the idea of the reductuion of vehicles and fossil fuel admission. This is an advantage to people because they perfer a healthy, stress free life, according to the passege, "As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here".

Smog is usually because of fossil fuel admission. This is why Paris proposed a partial ban to vehicles. Paris nearly had a near-record pollution. Paris was a little more operatable, according to the passege "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing,China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Less congestion is a valid reason to limit vehicle use, being more spacious and operatable.

People may complain about the penalties or the transportation is needed, but people can carpool, and transportation was free in that limited time frame. eventually the fog was less visable, and people could return to the normal lives. However the damage is continuing, Getting a smart car would be a splendid idea, trade the bad fossil fuel car, to provied clean transportation if needed.  Cars are hurting the world and living things in it, including ourselfs. We should take a stand and end this tragedy were casing.
