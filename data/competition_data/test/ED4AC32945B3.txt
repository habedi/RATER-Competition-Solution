Just take a moment to think about how your community is around you, Think off how our world and community is, Think about everything that is happening to our school campuses, and this is why I believe that students should be required to perform community service.

To begin with, students have nothing much better to do other than go hang out with friends or be home doing nothing. For example, when students are in school what are they doing ? Most of the time yes we're doing work in our classes but think about after lunch when you have nothing to do, us students should take the time to help make our community a better place even if its just by picking up a few pieces of paper off the floor. With just those couple of papers you've made a change in our lives. Also think about when students go through passing period most of the time all the students do is stand there and talk, you should put students to do community service it'll give them something to do other than waste valuable time that can be used for something good.

Another point to consider, community service will keep some students off the street so they wont make a bad decision and end up in a bad situation or hurt. For example, just last week there was a boy named OTHER_NAME he was fourteen years old and went to SCHOOL_NAME. One day he was hanging out with his friends and I guess he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time because just that day he ended up getting shot. I believe that if schools made kids perform community service things like this wouldn't happen because students will have spent more time in school helping to make a difference other than being out on the streets possibly about to get hurt.

In conclusion, this is why I believe that students should be required to perform community service. It'll keep some students off the streets, give students a chance to help make a difference, and also I believe students should perform community service because most students don't have anything better to do.
