i don't think that the new technology is valuable. I don't think it's valuable because there is really no need to check how people feel. I think that would be valuable in other situations, like for depressed people, or for like an aslyum to check how these people feel. I think that it would be a waste of money, it would be to much money for all the features to add. The passage said that it Facial Action Coding System would have to scan your face and i think that would be a lot of money for just making something that would be able to check how you feel. You could sell it to certain people that help people out with emotional things, so like they would scan their face in the begining to see how they feel, after the meeting they have the person in charge would have to scan their face to see if that meeting changed the way they felt from the begining. It would be good for certain uses but to have it in schools wouldn't really help. I think it wouldn't help in schools because i don't think people would just like it if you just had to scan there face to see how they feel, i think you have to ask them first and if they say yes you can see how they feel. I don't think we should have this around because there is really no need why you need to check how people feel if you don't know who they are. Even if they are just students doing what they need to do i don't think they would like people knowing how they feel, i know i wouldn't like people scanning how i felt if i don't know them because some people don't like people knowing the stuff they feel and how they feel unless you know them and can trust them.
