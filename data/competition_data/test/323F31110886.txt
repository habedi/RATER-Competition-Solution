Using technology to read students' emotions is something of great value and could be useful to have in the classroom. According to paragraph 2 a computer can, "Recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel", meaning teachers could know when their students are confused and get them right back on track. Teenagers have become very good at holding in how they feel, it's best authorities know. Emotions are key in todays society.

Technology is advancing rapidly it's best people use it when helpful. This technology could be put to use in many ways whether that is finding out how well students are learning, or figuring out how students feel on a personal level ehich could be depressed, anxious, unexcepted, etc. In article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", paragraph 5 states, "Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried etc." This rains true in the classroom, when students get confused, some won't even speak up but hide their "facial trait." Technology could be used to hurt or help, and it's best students recieve more help.

How others feel is very important. It dictates the way they do everything whether someone is angrily making a cup of coffee, or joyfully talking to friends at their sons' soccer game. In paragraph 6 it states, "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This provides an additional help to keep students on track and not stressed. Students are valubale, and any technology used to help them in life should be considered valuable as well.
