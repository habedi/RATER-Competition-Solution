No more sports?

What would school be like of there weren't any sports to keep you active? I think students that can maintain a C average shows that they are at least trying , maybe not hard enough but they are trying. Hands-on activities sometimes encourage students to want to learn, having fun may also make students want to come to school. Having rules for sports grade wise, sometimes make students especially boys want to do better in school so that their able to be or play on the team. Telling students that sports activities will be band will make them not care or want to go to school. School is for learning but there is also some room for fun, sports is the fun part of school. Of course some sports may cause students to get behind on homework because of practices, but the school can set up a program after school for students that play sports. A program that will allow them to get a better understanding of their work and a start on their homework. I know students shouldn't only think about doing sports but sometimes a sport can relief you and relax you. If a student isn't doing well in a class and they need special help outside of the classroom they can also attend the after school program. This program doesn't only have to be for the students that play sports. I say that the principal should let the students that's getting a C average play a sport and attend the program and if the after school program helps improve their grade that should show how much sports can make a person want to strive and learn more. Doing sports in school can show students what they are capable of doing. Some students might want to play a sport in college, but how can they discover their good at it if they have no way of playing it or being introduced to it. Most professional athletes started their career in high-school. And they played the sport every year until they got good and comfortable enough to be able to say "this is what i want to do with my life." "This is the career that will better my future."

That idea could also change her mind. I think of sports as a motivation to be able to participate in a sport and get my work done and maintain good grades. Sports can also make students healthy and active. If the idea doesn't work the students that aren't getting a C average should be issued some tutoring classes or help from their teacher.
