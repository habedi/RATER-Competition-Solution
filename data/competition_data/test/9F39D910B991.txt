dear principal,

I do not believe that it is right to restrict what sport a student plays just because there average grade is not a B what if a student is having trouble in class and not understanding the work. making them quit the team will solve nothing just cause more problems. It will make them fe if a student wants to go to collage but does not have the grades or the money but they are good enough at sports to get an athletic scholarship then why shouldn't they. but with this policy a student my be left with nothing because they did not have the grades to get on the team even thought they are passing all of there class's.

i think that this policy is not fear to all the people on a school team. A good player that likes the team and wants to be a part of it is taken of just because they do not have a B average. while a player that does not really want to be on the team and does not try his hardest is left on the team just because he qualifies for the grades.

grades are the most important part of school but kicking some one off a team for not having a B average will do thing to help the kid improve.
