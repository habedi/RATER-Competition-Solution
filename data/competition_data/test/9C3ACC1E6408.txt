Aliens did not make this face for seval reson. It was made naturaly. There are alot of evidence to back up my stament. Other NASA scientist can back me up on this. Here are some resons.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team smapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on JPL web site revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added."So, if there were object in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramid or even small shack, you could see what they were!"

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivlent of a butte or mesa-landform commom around the American West. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in hte Snake River Plan of Idaho," says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

If that does not convince you then nothing will. It is just a natural landform. Garvin said it and other people did too. So I backed my infomation up.
