If my principal were to instate mandatory extracurricular activities then I would probably agree with their decision. There are a verity of extracurricular activities to participate in, so there is definitely something for everybody. Extracurricular activities are also a great way to meet people and make life-long friends. Furthermore, having extracurricular activities at a school can benefit the school in many ways. all in all, extracurricular activities are an important thing to have in schools.

There are many kinds of extracurricular activities. If one were interested in athletics, then they have the opportunity to try out for their school's sports teams. If they were interested in academics or needed help with their studies then homework club, science club, and other clubs of similar nature are all good options. If the student so chose they could participate in the musical, an art club, a coding club, a computer making club, a jewelry making club or any number of different activities all geared toward a different kind of student. This variety makes it so an extracurricular so suit anybody is easy to find.

Another benefit to extracurricular activities is their ability to help friendships. Going to a new activity allows you to meet new people with interests similar to your own. There is also the option of going to a club with somebody you are already friends with, drawing your friendship closer. I know that from a personal perspective I have made many friends, and even a few best friends, with the help of extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are a good way to make friends.

On top of all that there is the simple, abject benefits that extracurricular activities have upon your school. Yearbook is a program that helps the school, and is also an extracurricular activity. The school newspaper, student council, Eco club and many similar activities also have benefits for the school. Clubs and activities also boost moral and help students associate school with excitement and fun. The benefits of these activities affect everyone and so rules that help participation in these activities should be encouraged.

If my principal were to instate a rule regaurding a mandatory participation in extracurricular activities I would support it. Due to the fact that extracurriculars benefit everyone, their school, and their friendships, this rule would be a good plan. Extracurricular activities are an important thing to have in schools.
