There are many people that are for having driverless cars, but I am against it. I am against it for many reason. First reason is because it will make people lazy. Second reason is because a computer cannot think like a human brain. Last reason is because they are not safe.

My first reason I am against these cars are because they will make people lazy. America already has enough lazy people. So why will we waste money on sensors to make a car drive by itself when we can control it ourselfs. According to paragragh 7

"They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themselfs." But paragraph 7 also say

"road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." Which proves the only time you will actually have to drive is if you run into those situations.

Another reason I am against driverless cars ae because we can't trust technolgy to get us out of every situations. For example say you are riding and you car comes out to oncoming traffic and it wont stop. There will be nothing yuo can do to stop it. But if you can actually control the car than you wont have to worry about that because you know when to stop our car. Technology wise we are not ready for a driverless vechical.

My final reason I am against these cars are because the just arent safe. There are so many things that can happen while driving this car. For example a glitch can happen in the systemor you cars brakes stop working and you wont be able to stop and you could have nothing to do about it. In paragragh 6 it say a radar cost "two hundred million dollars." Why can't we use that money to make cars we can frive by ourselfs safer other than wasting money on a computer that can glitch out and stop working on us?

I am against driverless cars because they will make us lazier as a nation. They cannot think like a human brain. And finally because they just are not safe enough to be on the roads.
