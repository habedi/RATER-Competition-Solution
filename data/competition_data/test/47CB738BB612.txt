Certain schools offer classes that can be taken online through conferencing but why is that? Going to school can be annoying and even a time consuming task. Some students don't even go to the physical school they stay home because school is a long ways away and just do school online, or they don't like leaving the comforts of their own home. These are just some of the problems facing students who don't live near their school or the closest school to them is far away. This is why distance learing by way of video conferencing is a great alternative that students can benefit from: for one it helps save them time, two students can be far away from school, and three students can stay in the comforts of their own home.

Doing online conferencing to attend school is a great time saving option. In my life I sometimes find myself rushing in the moring to get ready and eat breakfast in the morning to catch the bus in time, but if I could use video conferencing I would not have to rush in the morning. I would simply have to set up my computer and connect to whatever system the school is using for the video conferencing. However, some people might say "wouldn't it take a long time to set up the conferencing system?" While the answer might be yes to that question, I suppose the schools would make it easy as possible to set up for the student making it a time efficient and easy task.

For some students the distance for them would be too much to travel everyday. Plus all that extra driving would mean the student or students would have to give up sleep in place of driving to school. For me I do not live very far from school so I cannot relate to this problem, but I know some fellow students of mine who live a long ways away from school who would much rather get that extra sleep and be more prepared for the day than driving during that time. Also long distance can be very repetitive on the student and make them less willing to participate in school. That is where online video conferencing comes into the equation to help solve this problem. With video conferencing they stay home for classes and do not have to drive that long distance to school.

Last students do not like to be uncomfortable, they want to stay within the comforts of their own home. For this problem I definitely can relate to it. In the mornings you can find me sulking around the house sleep deprieved and getting ready for school. Like me many others students face this same exact problem. They are tired and not mentally prepared for the day ahead of them. As well as, being physically and mentally demanding for certain students school can also be socially awkward for others. The students who usually find themselves in these awkward positions would not have this problem when using the video conference system. Therefore, complying to the social norms of society and school is not necessarily required of students who use video conferencing, making school easier and more comfortable for them.

Video conferencing is a great tool for students who want to stay within their own comfortability, live long distances from school, and need that extra time to prepare themselves. So I say to you if you find that students have these sorts of problems to help them explore these alternatives, because distance learning by way of video conferenc is an amazing way students with these experiences could benefit in school.Â
