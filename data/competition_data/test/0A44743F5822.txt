I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it can be a life changing experience. It can be a life changing experience because you can visit places,help animals as they travel over sea,and you can have fun while on the job. There are several reasons why people should join but i'll explain the major three.

My first reason why people should join the program is because you can travel to places you'll wont see everday. In the text it states that Luke said the cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy. He also said he had the side benenifit of seeing Europe and China, also he said seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

My second reason why people should join the program is because you can help animals grow,help them stay healthy, and and get them to their destination safely. In the passage it states the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day. The text also states that bales of hay and bags of oats had to pulled up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned. Also the text states that Luke helping out his aunt at her farm as a boy helped prepare for hard work.

My final reason why people should join is because you can have fun to pass time. you can find things to do to keep you entertained. In the text it states that Luke also found time to have fun on board. The text states that the cowboys played baseball and vollyball games. They also had table tennis tournaments and boxing.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboy program can change your life in many ways you can care for animals and go places you will enjoy and have fun at the same time.
