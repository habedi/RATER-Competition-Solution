In Pargaraph 4 it is saying "long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth".

So to fix the problem of people getting hurt now NASA is trying to get a 30 or so mile blimp to hover over the roiling Venusian landscape. At the endof the article It says that they strived to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endavors. At the end of all of this i would still not go because you dont know what is around it or in it to get you hurt.

The purpose of this essay is persuade people not to go to Venus beause its deadly. I dont kno if i would trust the inside of Venus or a 30 or miles so blimp floating of the landscape. Never go to Venus because of what can happen to you while your in it or out.
