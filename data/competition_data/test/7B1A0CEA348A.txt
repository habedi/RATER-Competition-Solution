Thesis- I disagree with it because students may not have time to do it, may have chores or responsibilites to do after school, and even work in a job after school.

1. Why i say disagree is that students should have the right to choose if they want to participate in a extracurricular activity or not. They should not be forced to do something that they might not like to do. For example, a student is told to participate in a sport or any school extracurricular activity they might like a sport or the school council but if he or a she dont want to then he or she should not be to told to do the extracurricular activity.

2. One of the examples of why i disagree is people really dont got time after school, like teens after school may have to work after school so then they got not going to have time to do anything like a extracurricular activity. Students aswell may not like it because it's to much for them because they might be tired or even stressed out because of the work they did in school for 8 or 7 hours its to much that students mostly likely would like to go home then to stay after school to do extra work.

3. Responsibilites are a other reasons that students don't got time after school. One of the biggest responsibilites is to take care of your sibilings, or clean the house, take out the trash , and even do homework. So much student's dont got time for it because of those responsibilites that they have to do first. When they are done by then they are not even gonna have energy to do stuff after because of how much stuff they already have done.

4. Displince if a other reasons that students dont go time after school. Alot of students get in trouble during school or even after school and that what school need to know is that when students get in trouble in like getting into a fight, an being annoying in classes, an not doing your work and just talk is gonna get u in trouble. All of those displinces are gonna get u in a lot of trouble and students need to learn from that by just not doing nth after school and going straight to his or she house.

5. What im trying to say is that students should have right to say if that they want to do a activity or not because there are alot of stuff that students got to do after school. This was my opinion of the disagree side of students should participate in activitys. To summarize it all up is that, Students got alot of responsibilites to do in life and that how life is that there is alot of responsiblites that must be done first before u can do any activity with your friends or anyone.
