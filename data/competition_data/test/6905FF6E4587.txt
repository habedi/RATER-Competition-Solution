Cars can change the universe

Fellow citizens there should be a limit on car usage . If there's limits with our car usage then we would have a better community, there would be less pollution,less drugs passing through other citizens cars. If there isn't a limit on car usage us citizens would be the ones suffering from chemicals getting into ourÂ  lungs from all the pollution our own cars let out, two we would be affecting our community because everyone wouldn't walk anywhere they'd just spend money on gas going to somewhere or visting there friends and family . Better to save the earth, then to damage the earth.

First, why not just have limits on car usage saves our community just by a little step like that. We wouldnt have to worry about just walking down the street and a drunk driver just coming out of no where and hitting us. In source 1, by Elisabeth Rosenthal in interview a mother of two and she said, "When I had a car I was always tense." why be tense when you can be stress-free just by not using your cars all the time and having limits on them. If we actually do help our community by having limits on our car usage then we could make cities denser,and healthier community to walk around in.

Second, pollution sucks, these chemicals we're observing are eventually going to hurt us in the long run we are either going to die of the gas our cars are releasing or we're either going to get really sick from it. Who wants to get sick because a stupid decision of driving a car? most definetly not me. These limits are for the best for us citizens . Like source 3, by Andrew Selsky States ,"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air ."of course its better to just take a nice walk than to just be lazy and drive a car. Bike rides with friends sound better than a car ride, in a car people usually blast the music and don't communicate with one another, but while you bike ride you can communicate with one another and actually have fun racing eachother on these bike rides healthier than a car ride.

Last, with the limits of car usage smoggling can be prevented because it won't be easy for people from other countries trying to pass by in cars with drugs because the state would have certain transportations they can only use which they might not want to use because it's so public. Source 2 states, last week, Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter(pm) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,his only means someone from another country brought it to Paris and its ended up at London who knows how.

It's better of just having car usage limits to prevent drug passing, also to help our community, and have a healthier earth without pulluting the eart.
