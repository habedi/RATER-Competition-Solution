"Look Adrian, I know you might think that, that landform is a face carved in Mars by aliens but the facts are right here," Keilah says gesturing around the room. Adrian scoffs and chuckles saying, "I know a face when i see one, especially if it is up on Mars because none of our astronauts could have been able to make something like that and for what?" - he pauses then continues, "Of course it had to be aliens!"

Keilah starts to explain, "First, us scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. You know something common enough around the Planet Cydonia only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." As Adrian jumps right back in almost as he wanted to interrupt her but had waited, he gives his own reasons. He says excitedly, " Yeah but, after that a few days later we (NASA) unveiled the image with a caption saying that there was a huge rock form which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Right after noticing all the features I had to believe it was real! Not only that, but that aliens had put it all together! KEILAH, DONT' YOU SEE IT?"

"No I do not Adrian. I see the facts and what the picture actually shows. It's clearly the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- LANDFORMS COMMON AROUND THE AMERICAN WEST! hmm I seem to agree with 'Gavin' when he stated that it had reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also when Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos it revealed a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all. Sorry buddy I guess you'll have to do more research or look a little closer next time haha." Keilah says as she puts an end to the 'Face on Mars' argument.
