Extracurricular Activities

At dismissal time, my principle made an announcementÂ saying that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Do you agree with this decision?

Well, I don't agree with this decision and here are my three reasons why.

My first reason is that extracurricular activities would affect our sleep time.

Although it can keep students busy and organized, students would have less time to sleep.

For example, my friend Generic_Name stays after school for a sport, and he also babysits his little brother, he comes to school tired everyday, but if he didn't do the extracurricular activity and had more sleep time, he would not be tired everyday.

Because students don't get enough sleep, some students come to school late.

Over seventy percent of students fall asleep in school, thirty percent of students come to school late, and forty percent of the students that fall asleep in class participate in extracurricular activities.

My second reason is that you would have less time for homework.

For example, I played basketball.

It was Thursday night right after my game and I had a quiz the following day.

The homework was for me to study over my notes for my quiz tomorrow, but by the the time I got home, it was time for me to go to bed.

The next day arrived and I took the test...and failed it, If i would have not played basketball, I would have had time to study, and I most likely would've passed my test.

My third and final reason is you would have less time to spend with family and friends.

They are most important, family and friends don't mean anything unless you spend time with them.

One day I wanted to stay after school for basketball, but I also wanted to go to my niece first birthday party.

It was a hard choice, but I had to stay back for basketball.

Only if I did not participate in any extracurricular activities, I could have been at my niece first birthday party and supported her.

In conclusion, all students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities.

It causes less time with family and friends, sleep time, and lees time for homework.

Who side are you on?
