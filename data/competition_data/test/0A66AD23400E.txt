A lot of schools all over the country are not allowed to use their cell phones during the school day. Cell phones are a big distractions to students. If they could use them at certain times during the day, I think the kids would be less tempted to use the phones when they are not supposed to. I think i speak for all students that it would be great to use cell phones at the appropriate time during the day.

Many kids text during class when they aren't supposed to. I feel they do that because, there are so many rules on what you can and cannot do. At times, you just want to sort of rebel against some of the rules. If we could text during our lunch break or when we have free time in class, students would not feel the need to always have their phone out. It would be a great idea to let the students have their phones and use them at the appropriate time.

If students were not able to bring their cell phones with them to school at all, how would they be able to get a ride home? Or if there were an emergency and needed to call a parent. There are many reasons why students need their phones at school. It would not be good to take the privilege of having a phone away from the kids. The school does not pay for the students phone or have anything to do with their property.

I think the school should most definitely let the students use their phones during the day. Temptation to text when you are not supposed to would probably be lowered. Most students need to have cell phone so they can call a parent, or to find a ride home. Taking that privilege away could cause many problems.

You should seriously consider letting us use our cell phones during lunch breaks and free time.
