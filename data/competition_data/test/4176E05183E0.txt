What are the benefit for the students from being able to attend class from home ?

I believe student will get more offers online,therefor, benefits online offers are, students will have less stress and more help form teachers,more focus on there work also less distraction. I also would say that online has everyone going on about also kids in school have used phones so maybe it is time to move on to something new.

My first reason is that some kids who are slow learns in a class with a lot of students in there class , are kids who will have more trouble in class . Slow learning kids get easily distraction by anything in class also more like not to finish there work and instant of doing there work they will talk to there peers . Also there are other problems like, there are many kids that would need a teachers help but she can only help one kid at a time. Therefor, some of the kids don't get the help they need. Also some the kids who are trying to do there work would be disturb by the noise in the classroom which will cause the student to get frosted.

Take a kid for example, in school things are going great for her and she has friends and she doing good in school , then out of know where her grads drop and she lost her friends and now she doesn't want to do anything anymore and she stops trying also this cause her to hate school because of problems in school . This is the other reason .

My third reason is the online videos. The online videos can help students finish the work they didn't had time for,students will have less difficult on there classwork they will have more time understanding form the videos that help them. Student that are in class will have more trouble cashing up with the class because teachers would like to move up to the next topic. this the reason kids in class are be hide and have no time to finish.

my least reason ,I believe that some the kids skip school because they find school not import and the reason they feel that way because there going through stuff at school and they don't want to be there when bad times come and kids find school unsafe and things could happen in school and nobody would know about it. So stay home and doing work online is a better idea.

These are all the reason kids should take online class at home , this gives you safety and this can help in your needs and to keep you up with others in class also teachers can help you more likewise this gives you more time . This also will keep you out of problems. so attending online class are good benefit.
