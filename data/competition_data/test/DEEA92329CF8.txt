The world of cars is rapidily changing due to their emission of greenhouse gases. These gases not only are warming the globe as a whole but are more locally effecting the quality of air in our cities. Efforts are being made to lower the amount of gases and improve air quality such as Car-free day in Colombia and bans on driving in Paris. For Colombia the city of Bogota has built bike roads and nice sidewalks to limit the need or want to drive and ultimitely reduce smog. During their last year millions of people walked on their car-free day even when it rained showing that people want to make a difference and positively help their enviroment.

In some areas like Paris where pollutants are at 147 micrograms per cubic meter drastic actions had to made during its peak on smog. The city of Paris put a partial ban on driving reducing the smog by 60 percent.

Some communities like Vauban, Germany have created car free suburbs and building lifestyle around that. Instead of large suburbs like we have here in the States they have focused on making shopping within walking distance. People of Vauban have been reported to being less stressed and more happy after living in a car free community. However; this is not the most practical here efforts can be made to redesign how we live such as making super markets easier to access on an everyday basis and only buying the groceries that you need for a couple of days instead of a week or two. This trend has brought people from all over Germany to live there and has set a trend changing how other communites live there lifestyle.

Giving up cars has can build a better life for you and the planet by reducing pollution and lowering your stressÂ but it in order for its full benefits it needs to be done as a community.
