Dear principle

I agree with your statement about not letting students participate in sports unless they have a b average. One of the reasons i agree with you is because if students don't have good grades in school they could fail and they cant play any sports so it is really important that the athletes concentrate more in school and do all of their work. If you could get there coach to talk to them about there grades and how it could affect them and effect the team. But one thing i don't really like is that most students might have trouble with the material that they are learning in school so if the teachers see they are confused they should talk to them. If they need more help they should schedule something with the teachers that way they get more help and get a better grade but also have time to be in the sport they play. This is a great article telling students that play sports to get good grades. But also if they need help they should talk with the teachers or with you. If there are a lot of athletes that need help the teachers should host a program to help them out.

sincerely
