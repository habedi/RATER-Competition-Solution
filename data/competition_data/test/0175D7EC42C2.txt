In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the aurthor suggests studying Vens is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

I believe that the aurthor thinks this because Venus is the closest plant to earth by the means of density and size because of that it is often referred as the twin of Earth.

On Venus the planet in its self is a challenging planet to land on.

The clouds in Venus are made of highly corrosive sulfiric acid.

The temperature on Venus is about eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit.

The atmosphereic pressure is ninty time greater than Earth.

The tick atmosphereis almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide.

Compared to Earth these conditions are far more extreme for humans.

So extreme that there has not been an attempt to explore VVenus in over three decades.

Out of all the planets in the solar system Venus has the hottest surface temperature.

Astronomers believe that Venus may have once been like Earth a long time ago.

Venus might hav had oceans and could have probably supported many forms of life just as Earth.

Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth though.

The surface of the planet is a kind of rocky sediment and has familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

In conclusion I have discussed why the aurthor thinks Venus is a planet worth studying.

I have talked about the conditions of Vens such as the atmosphere and the temperature. Finally I talked about the terrian of Venus and how similar it is to the terrian on Earth.
