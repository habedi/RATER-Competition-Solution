Online school can be beneficial in many ways, but is it worth it? Many students take online school, but aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe that online school is beneficial because of how flexible it is and the amount of work the student is required to do.

Going to school can give you more practice on life skills such as communicating. In school kids are prepared with communication skills such as working with other students on a project or communicating with their teachers about a missed assignment or a missed test. Communication is used everyday in life. While in school from K-12, students are taught to communicate what they want and what they need. Students are taught to communicate if they need help, because if they don't it is a downward spiral to their learning. Communicating is very important in working with others and in the work foce, without that important skill, life becomes very difficult.

Going to school also provides the skill of collaborating. Many kids who go to school receive more practice through school work and presentations. Whether it is just working with someone on class work or even working on a presentation. Many teachers will assign classwork, or projects that give the student the option to work with another person or alone, but sometimes the teacher won't give the option to work alone and make it mandatory that you work with another classmate. Working with another student gives the students the opportunity to both take their ideas and put them together to complete the task at hand. Collaborating in school gives the student the practice they need when they enter the real world. Collaborating is very important in life and is used everyday, especially in the workforce.

Others believe that online school is best for a student, because of the flexibility it gives the student and the amount of work the student is given. Taking online school gives the student the freedom to work on their own schedule throughout the day and turn in work when they want by the time the work is due. Online students are also give the opportunity to have more breaks, where as going to school the only break the student gets is lunch time. Online students have the flexibility to wake up later and work to their speed. While students in school have a set time to arrive at school, what time to go to certain classes, and how fast they gotta work. The workload compared from online school and in school are very different. In school if a student has an assignment done, the next thing they know, they have another one for them to do. On top of that students usually go home with homework after that. While online schools work load is far less. Once the student completes their lesson for that class they are done for the day.

In conclusion, online school has many benefits such as flexibility and work load. While going to school has a far greater benefit, with preparing the student for the real world with life skills such as communication and collaboration. Many students take online school, but they aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe online school is very beneficial because of how flexible it is and the work load being much lower than going to school.Â
