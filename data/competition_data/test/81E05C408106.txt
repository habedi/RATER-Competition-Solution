In the aticle "unmasking the face of mars" they wanting you to believe thats there is some sort of rock formed as a face. This is wrong do not believe them. Need some reasons well here is three. They are doing this for money,they want to make it popular,and it took them a long time to make the very last conclusion.

In the article "unmasking the face on mars" people are saying that they see a face form with eyes,nose,and a human head. I believe that there is no face if you ask me. If you look closely to the picture in paragraph five it's clearly just a rock. NASA people are trying to proove there is a face is being shown. Trust me they are just trying to make a big theory.

Look at the article it says "the face on mars has since become a pop icon". It has starred in a hollywood film,appeared in books,magazines,radio talk shows and all. They want you all to make this formed rock popular they want you to make a big deal about it can't u see. There putting it on T.V,in movies,and on books its all for the money. Do not fall for any of there tricks.
