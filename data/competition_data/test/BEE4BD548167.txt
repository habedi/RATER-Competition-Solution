When comparing the Mona Lisa smile to othersyou can tell the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one, also Dr. Paul say's there's technology telling what a person if feeling by their face, lastly you can tell when a person is feeling some type of way by a video.

The difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile is that, a genuine smile is when you have to use less bones to smile about e6 bones to smile, and you look like your into the smile for a reason, and forced smile is when there's a smile barley on your face and its easy for you to get it off your face. Because, you were barley smiling, and that means your forcing yourself to smile.

Technology telling you how a person feel is kind unlikly to happen in this century right now. The only way too know how someone feel is by the way they act toward other people and theirself. they isolate theirself from everyone, and they don't be theirself.

When people start looking and things they dont normally look at, or normally watch then you know that something is wrong with them. Because, they not being theirself, and it's not normal for them to do something like that. It would be weird for you, and then your going to want to say something instead of sitting back and watching it happen.
