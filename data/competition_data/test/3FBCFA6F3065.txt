Dear Principal,

March 1, 2011

I heard that you were deciding whether to require all students to perform some type of community service? Now if it's true then please hear me out,

Community service in my opinion is something that people shouldn't be forced to do. Now community service is a great thing but, still if people don't want to put the time and or effort in to helping then it is a great loss to the community.

Community service should be totally an option anywhere we all can use the help in order to get the best outcome. In schools it is a great thing to do whether or not the school needs it. Like I said all types and forms of community service are great to have and useful to our environment.

Now also I think it to be better to encourage the people to do community service rather than having to require it.

Everyday life people need to step up and take part in the community service also, along with all the kids who already help.

I hope this helped somewhat on making your decision of community service a requirement or not. So please take everything I said in this letter in consideration and make the best choice and decision.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
