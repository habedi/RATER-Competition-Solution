There are many questions still to be answered about Venus. Was it really once a survivable atmosphere for life? Could there have been life on Venus at one point in time? Were there any plant or food sources?

Venus is Earth's twin planet due to it's similarity in size and density, making it probable that Venus was once very similar to our planet and living conditions. It shouldn't be a suprise it is desired to be explored and researched.

Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, besides it not being closest to the sun, Venus's average temperature is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Which leaves Venus being an Astronomic mystery. Even the atmospheric pressure is 90x greater than anything on earth,including the bottom of our oceans.

NASA has yet to discover a productive way to visit the planet. One idea being to hover atleast 30 miles over the landscape of Venus. A con to that is NASA's technology can not handle samples of gas or rocks due to the atmospheric pressure.

NASA is still working on ideas, a plan and the right technology to take a look at Venus which in the end, will be a magnificent discovery.

Taking a closer look at Venus could likely lead us to discovering something great in astromonmy and could likely help us answer some of the biggest questions of our Solar System.

Besides the dangers and great challenges, a history changing discovery could be made and is worth the risks.
