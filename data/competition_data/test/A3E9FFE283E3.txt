The author supports the evidence by giving examples of how venus is almost the same as earth. He also gives evidence of mars and venus being the best options to send drones and crafts to and says facts about venus and mars says that venus could of been just like earth a long time ago and could of had oceans all over its world. mars could of had oceans too craft that were sent to mars came back with sea chells and other ocean like things and mauntains look like the ones that we have here on earth people thing that venus and mars were both the same as earth but just died out and became deserts and eveything died on them. " Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too". "the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." these quotations show that the author is giving evidence on how Earth and Venus are kind of the same and how we can live on venus. These quotations also show facts about the features of venus and how it is similar to earth in many ways. the conclusion to my essay is that the author backed up his answer pretty good and had alot of good evidence in the story to back him up he also explained everything really well and answered all his questions with evidence to back them up and gave facts about more things like the temprature and how mars is the same and has almost the same features as Earth too and venus.
