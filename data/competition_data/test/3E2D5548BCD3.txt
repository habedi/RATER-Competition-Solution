Limiting usage of cars is actually a very good idea. There are many different reasons why it's a good thing to do. You won't waste as much money on gas anymore, or car payments. You won't waste time trying to find a parking space outside of Wal-Mart, while also trying to not run over pedestrians that refuse to move out of the way.

"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." - Heidrun Walter. Yes having a vehicle can be very stressful, and many people just choose not to have them.

You also have to worry about getting into recks. If you get hit think of all the money it will take to fix your car. Or worse!

It will just become so stressful.

"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on." - Michael Sivak. The rate of people owning cars is going down slightly more every year. Many people choose not to own cars because of there high prices. Some also choose not to own them because of the ridiculous gas prices also. Others choose differently and that's okay, because we all are allowed to have our own choice.
