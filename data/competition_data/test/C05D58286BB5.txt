Do you participate in an extra curricular activity? Is it inside or outside of school? Generic_Name, the principal of Generic_School believes that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Making student participate in at least one extracurricular activity is very unfair policy. This mean that all student must participate in either a school sport, yearbook committee, or be apart of the student council. Some students already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school, or have health problem that don't allow them to participate in sports, and students shouldn't be forced to participate in something they don't want to participate in.

If student already participate in an extracurricular activity outside of school this would make them participate in 2 sports which would be a really hard time schedule to balance. With all the competitions that most sports team compete in this would make it hard to find time for studying and completing homework. Competing on 2 sports teams in very uncommon because it is so hard to manage.

Everyone has some health issue or problem that they must be careful of when participating in physical activities. 50% of Americans have Asthma and 30% of Americans have breathing issues. When kids are young it is hard to diagnose Asthma. If these kids were on a school sports team and had an Asthma attack there would be no way to help them because if they were never diagnosed with Asthma, they won't have an inhaler to help them. This whole incident would have never happened if the Mrs. Jones hadn't required students to participate in one extracurricular activity.

Students shouldn't be forced to participate in activities they don't want to participate in. This rule is UN-Constitutional and should be gone immediately. It is forcing students to do something they don't want to do. Being in an area where you have been forced to do something you don't want to do doesn't make a very good learning environment. This makes very hostile environment for students and it doesn't make them feel very comfortable.

Making student participate in at least one extracurricular activity is very unfair policy. Some students already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school, or have health problem that don't allow them to participate in sports, and students shouldn't be forced to participate in something they don't want to participate in. I hope you agree with me that making student participate in at least one extracurricular activity is very unfair policy.
