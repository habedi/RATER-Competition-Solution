I would agree with the decision to make all students participate in after school activity. I would agree with this decision for a couple of different reasons. One of them would be bringing people together. Parents may start to think and appreciate the teachers more for going above and beyond staying after school to work with there kids. This would paint a new path and a new picture for the schools future.

Not only only would extracurricular activities get more students and teachers working together forming good relations, but it would help students see teachers and the school in a new light. Students may start to appreciate there teachers more and may start to like them. Students could feel more confident with there teachers because they share some of the same interests. Not only this but the teachers may get to see how hard working there students are working outside of school, and maybe the students just need a push or in other words a little bit of help.

I feel like parents also would appreciate getting the kids off there butts and getting them to interact with there fellow teachers and students. By making encouraging there kids to have a open mind about after school activities they could also find out what there schools offer and possibly the parents could be interested. The students who look at taking after school activities with a good attitude will get hooked and find something they really enjoy. When the students come home from there extracurricular activities they could tell there parents all about it and maybe teach there parents something they dont know.

When you sign up or good to a after school activity try and go with at least one friend who is also interested in the same topic. This will give you a safe feeling and you will have someone to share the fun with you! Not only will you have one friend there but if you bring a friend there is a 100% chance you will make more friends there. The teachers will find it very exciting you found a extracurricular activity you enjoy and made new friends. With all the work you will be doing in your after school activity at least when it gets hard you will have a friend next to you to make it better.

In conclusion I think this is a very positive decision made by the principal and agree with it completely. There are so many benefits to going to after school activities. Meeting new people and finding interests you may have never new about. For all you know you could have found a career you love and want to do as a job. Finding new friends and meeting new teachers and strengthening you relationship with your teachers is a very smart thing to do. I would highly recommend other schools to do the same as this school and help your students find a activity they love.
