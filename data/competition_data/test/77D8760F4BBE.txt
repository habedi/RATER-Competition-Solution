Driverless cars

I think driverless cars will be an accident waiting to happen. I think they will just become an danger to people. Sergey Brin is talking about driveless cars, but for a start they arent even driveless at all.

They have a lot to look into before making these cars legal like road condition, an accident, or work areas for the county to do work. There still has to be someone toughing the steering wheel to make the car even move. Before these cars can even become worthy of driving elder people or driving at all it needs to pass a saftey corse or something i think to be able to get on the market.

If these people making these car think about all the promblems that can occur, saftey for the people riding inside the car, and other people around the outside of the car, and make sure that car works like its suppose to before sales start. I think it wouldnt be a bad think to do, but as of right now its just to dangers to trust something that has failed or could poosibly die from.
