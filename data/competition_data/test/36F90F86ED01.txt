Dear Principle,

I strongly suggest you should allow students to have their cell phones out during the lunch time, and free time. They should definitely turn their phones off during class time, because we need to get their education. During class time, if some students just paying attention to their phones, they wouldn't get any learning done, or even pay attention to what the teachers are saying. I suggest, when coming into the class room, the students hand their phone over to the teacher, or must show the teacher him or her turning it off. The teacher would know that the students paying attention then. Having your phone in class, is foul. What if there is a test coming up, and the class is going over it, and the student is not paying attention. That student would fail, just because of his or her phone. The only time through out the day they should have their phones should be, free time and lunch. There is no learning being done, so why not have it out. There really isn't no harm in having your phone out during those times of the school day. If the students shows defiance, or abuse to the phone rule, the phone should get taken from that student. The students should get three warnings. 1. Warning. 2. Taken till end of class. 3. Parent has to come get it. Its good that you may allow us to have phones out, but if they abuse these rules, you should cut students from having phones in or at our school period.

Sincerely ,

Student
