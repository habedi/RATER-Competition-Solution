NEAP Essay

Dear Principal.

Cell phones are a common growing material in the United States and other countries most teenagers/kids have them. They are useful in some hands ,but unnecessary in the other.

With the use of cell phones kids surf the web, text their friends, and call their friends/family.

While cell phones can help you when your lost it can also help you cheat which is dishonesty not tolerated in many places in the United States of America

I think that the first policy is better than the second one because of the following reasons. First, I think that if you completely take away cell phones you will get more people displeased. This would happen because when have something and you take it away most people would be mad and they would retaliate by bringing their phone secretly inside the classroom. If the students do achieve to sneak their cell phones into a classroom they would not pay attention to the lesson that the teacher is conducting.

Second, I think that the first policy is better than the second because it lets the students still use their cell phones. Its good that they cant bring their cell phones to the classroom because they can use their time more productively by paying attention the lesson going on. I think it was a good idea how you let the students bring their cell phones during the free time you provided but it shouldn't be allowed in the classroom. So basically what I am saying is this you should have a third policy stating that you could bring your cell phones in the morning close it during class and turn it back on at the end of the school day.

Finally, if you didn't consider my policy i would have to agree on your first policy because it gives the students some time to relax while surfing on the internet. I think that the second policy is also bad policy because it makes your school more strict which isn't a bad thing but to much of something good can lead to bad things. So basically I am with the first policy and I think that it gives the students a break which they need often.
