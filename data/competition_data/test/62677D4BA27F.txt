The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus' believes that Venus, Earth's twin, needs to be explored.

Venus has very extreme conditions, but according to the author nothing us humans can't handle.

With a little bit of creativity and curosity, humans can learn about Venus.

Scientist have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus, but most have only lasted for a few hours.

With this it is hard to gather information, but why would scientists even want to send spacecrafts to it if they think there is no chance of anyone ever living there?

In the article it states,"Astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."

A long time ago, Venus could have supported various forms of life.

If it could then, than maybe there is a chance in the future for it to.

Venus conditions are dangerous, but the author says we can find ways around them.

For example, in the story, it states,"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."

Having a vehicle stay out of the high pressure, high temperature area could be a safe alternative to explore Venus.

The only issue with it would be that peering out of a ship can only provide the scietists with limited information on the ground conditions.

NASA is very creative and has started creating electronics made of silicon carbide so they can withstand Venus's conditions.

For example, in the story it states," some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." The spacecrafts that were previously sent there only lasted hours, so NASA is making improvements.

Hopefully, NASA can continue on this road to improving and one day get humans to Venus safely.

"Curiosity killed the cat" is a famous saying.

If we do not explore Venus now, human curiosity will lead us to many equally or more dangerous things.

The author supports their idea very well and makes multiple vaild points explaining why we should become a little more creative so we can explore Venus now. There would no longer be any curosity about it, making it safer.
