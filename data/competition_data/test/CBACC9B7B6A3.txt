Dear principal,

I respect your wishes to make a new rule stating that students' may not participate in school activities and sports, if they can not keep their average of a B. I agree with you, I feel this way because that would be motivation for the students' to keep their grades up, so they can participate in activities and sports. The shy children who don't understand the text, might be more willing to raise their hand and ask for help, so they can do those kind of things. And I think that the students' test scores would improve very much. Children love it when the school has activities that they can attend. Its what keeps them more willing to go to school every morning. So i suggest that the principal do change the school policy. Some students' may not like this idea at all, but they will eventually get over it because they want to attend the activities, and be on the sport's team. You have my opinion , which states that it would be a wonderful move for the school if they do this.
