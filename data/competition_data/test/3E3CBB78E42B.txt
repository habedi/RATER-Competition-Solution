Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Most of the students here at school think we have the right to have our cell phones on at school. We understand that we shouldn't use then in class but we should be allowed to use them at lunch and in our free time. There are a few reasons why we believe this is a better policy.

For starters, what if there was and emergency and we needed to be contacted directly. We know that our parents can just call the school but we believe that it is more confidential and more private on our own phones.

We understand that using phones in class is wrong but we do it anyway. We feel that if we had time during the day to check our phones we as students won't need to text or talk during class time.

What if we need to get picked up from school. We would only be able to contact a parent from our cell phones. This is because the school does not allow us as students to use the school phones to ask our parents to pick us up early unless we are sick. So if we need to contact a parent the cell phone is the only way.

Lets say that I left my book at home. No teacher would let me use the school phones for a call for a book. That is why if we had our phones we wouldn't need to use the school phones. Lets say I left my phone at home. The school wouldn't let me call to get my phone. That is why I would use a friends phone.

If you were to ban phone use in school, then there would be even more people texting and calling during school. They would think that it would be unfair and more and more students will start using their phones in school.

If the teachers are allowed to use there phones in school why can't we use ours. That is how a lot of students feel.

We don't seem why it is bad to use our phones in our free time and at lunch. If we are on our free time we would be allowed to use our phones because there are no classes. As long as we don't text or call anybody who is in class, we should be allowed to use them in our free time. During our lunch time, we should also be allowed to use our phones to ask a parent to drop off our lunch if we forgot it.

Most students here at school feel that we should be allowed to have them on us during school but only be allowed to use them during free time and lunch. Just about all students think that is fair. I hope you take these reasons into consideration when you are choosing which choice for our schools phone policy.

Your Student,
