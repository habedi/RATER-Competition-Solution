Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing and I think students would definitely benefit from this.

Many schools in today's world do not offer classes that can be taken at home simply because it is to much work.

Students would not only benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but they would also get to work at their own pace and not feel rushed by other classmates.

Distance learning could result in better grades and even attendance, due to the fact that they would be working at their own pace.

I strongly agree that being able to attend classes at home would benefit the student in many ways.

Students would most definitely benefit from attending classes from home simply due to more time to complete assignments and have one-on-one video conferences with the teacher.

Many students feel pressured to complete the assignment when the other classmates have already completed it, but when the student could take the class at home and work at their own pace, it will most likely result in better grades.

For example, many schools are in session eight hours a day and that can get very stressful sometimes having to sit in a classroom the whole day and feel like you haven't learned one thing.

Another example is that students receiving video conferences with the teacher means that they could ask more questions and receive more help in order to better understand the material.

Many students would benefit from online classes at home and more schools should offer distance learning as an option for students.

Unfortunately, opponents argue that having classes at home would encourage the student not to finish their work and later result in failing the class and not being able to graduate.

For example, many students prefer not having school work to complete after school hours and having classes at home would only make matters worse.

Another example would be that having students doing school work at home would decrease their social skills and later in life regret not going to school and having memories to look back on.

However, I think students being able to attend classes at home would encourage them to get their school work completed on time in order for them to have time for friends and other activities outside of school.

Having the opportunity to have class at home is a huge benefit to students; not only to feel more comfortable in the space around them, but to get a better grasp on what they are learning and to concentrate on what they are trying to accomplish.

I strongly agree that being able to attend classes from home will most definitely benefit students. Being able to not worry about having enough time to complete an assignment will take a lot of the stress off the student and most likely result in a better grade.

Students would be able to benefit from having access to teacher video conferences when they are needing to ask questions and receive help from a lesson they may be struggling with. And most of all having long school hours can result in the student getting stressed out simply because they are overwhelmed with the amount work they have to accomplish in due time.

Therefore, I take stand on agreeing that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.
