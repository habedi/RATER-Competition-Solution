What if high school students did not have to go to school? Rather, what if they could take classes from home? Some high schools offer online classes by website or video conferencing. Many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it teaches them to be accountable, they don't have to come to school if they are sick, and some don't have to face bullies at school.

Most students who attend high school are constantly relying on their teachers to remind them when they need to do work. If students forget to turn in their work, they sometimes blame the teacher for not reminding them when the work is due. However, if students attended online classes at home, they would be responsible for what gets done. They can do their work anywhere by means of technology such as: laptops, tablets, and cell phones. This prepares high school students for college, and their future adult lives by teaching them to be responsible for their own time and work.

Quite often, many high school students become terribly sick. Many sickly students despise attending school. They're tired, contagious, and probably unable to focus. If they miss school due to illness, students miss hours of education that heavily impacts their grades. If students could attend class online, they would not miss anything taught at school that day. Students could work from home without passing on their sickness to other students or missing any important knowledge necessary for them to be successful.

Unfortunately, many students experience bullying from other students at high school. It heavily impacts the bullied children and they're mental health. Many of them no longer have the desire to attend school afterwards. To solve this dilemma, those students could have the opportunity to attend online classes from home. At home, they don't have to face monstrous bullies, and they can focus on their schoolwork. This would greatly benefit the defenseless students by helping them to be successful through education without attending high school.

Many high school students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it teaches them to be accountable, they don't have to come to school if they are sick, and some don't have to face bullies at school. Therefore, more schools should offer online courses and video conferencing for students because it is less beneficial not to do so.
