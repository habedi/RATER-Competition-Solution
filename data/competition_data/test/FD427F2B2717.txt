Not alot of people think that the face on Mars is real because we all know that there cant be life without light, food and oxygen but some people would argue that. Some sceintist would say that the face on mars surface would be proven that there is life on mars, but my opinion is that there is plenty of evdince that says that there cant be any life on any other planets because the space doesnt have an evnviorment like earth does. Why would there be a big face that looks like a rock with shadows of the surface of mars an people say there is life there. I say there wouldnt be life there because there would be no living anything on the planet just like every other planet. If there was living stuff on one planet wouldnt you think that there would be other proven facts that there is life on other planets? Which there isnt. Just like peoples imagination when we see stuff that we dont really see, like when sometimes you are looking at a cloud an you see a object because you think it might look like a animal or a living thing in the cloud but you arent really seeing the thing its just your imigination. I think thats the same thing that happened with the mars face because the poeple who too the pictures had a great imagintion, an it might of only been the obove view that made it look like a face because somtime when we look at something a different way or up close then it looks way different then it dos from the top view. I believ that it was just the peoples imigenation an the way the poeple looked at it from the view they were looking at it. The people who think its a real life thing on the surface of mars are the people who havent really checked into there cant be any living thing without other living resources
