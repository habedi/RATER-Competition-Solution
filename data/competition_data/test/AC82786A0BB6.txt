I am against it because, maybe people may be going through some things and are just depressed or sad but dont want anyone to know their personal business. I also feel like it is a violation of privacy. Everyone has bad moods and good moods and some days are not as good as the others, but i feel like it would be worse with people saying things like "hes sad" and then questioning that person, which can make the situation worse because maybe they may not want to talk about it. Also someone else telling you your emotion or how you feel may make you think you must feel that way for instance if they tell you your emotions but thats not right, you may try and correct yourself to fit the computers recognition. which is not right because i dont think it is fair that a computer should be able to tell you or say how you are feeling and what your emotions are. That would start conflict and attitude which will cause even more worse distracting emotions.
