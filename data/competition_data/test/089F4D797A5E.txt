My principal has decided that I have to join an extracurricular activity. I do not agree with this and think this should be banned. It is not fair,most people are busy after school,and it is WAY too stressful.

1 It is not fair. No one should be forced to join an extracurricular activity and it is not fair to force someone to give up their free time to join an extracurricular activity. Quite frankly it is not American our, founding fathers fought and died for our country risked being hanged by the British just so WE the people can CHOOSE so we can have freedom and not be forced to do anything.

2 Most people are busy after school. whether it's watching your siblings,working,other activities/hobbies,religious activities,chores other classes, or scouting people are very busy and can't do an extracurricular activity. And a lot of .those things require work,effort,time and it is impossible to do all those things when you are forced to join an extracurricular activity.

3 It is very stressful. People have way too many classes,it often requires you to meet after school,it could require some kind of leadership position,and if you have weak social skills this could be a terrible thing. I know it would stress me out,I just want to go home do my homework,drink my soda,an watch television,I don't want to be stressed.

Quite frankly it is not American,is it truly right for us to be forced to do anything,if so are we any better than the British? Our founding fathers died for our freedoms. So no we arent and that is why I think it should be banned.
