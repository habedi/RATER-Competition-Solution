When you lower the usage of cars in a certain area, you could see many benefits. Remember when you would hear occassionally that pollution in certain areas are affecting the world. And is it sort of worrying that you might be in one of those cities? Well, one of the main contributors is cars. Driving around, dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Swiping its claws at the Ozone layer. Many countries have suffered this pollution the hard way. As in France, they had to ban certain cars after every few days or so. Because the Smog in there was so dense. The pollution could have been very harmful if not given the right precautions. Scary right? Thats why citys like Vauban, Germany have noticed these facts and are now trying out some very "Eco friendly" solutions to help. They simply didnt use cars. They resident of the area knew of the danger and gave up their cars for the greater good. And it worked. The city was and still is very clean. And peacful without the very few sounds of motor cars from a distance away. A few city caught on to this, as they are also worried about pollution engulfing their atmosphere. So a few other city like Bogota, Columbia. Have made a car-free day in which the only means of transportation was a: Bus, foot, or bike. Which lowered the number of people you would see on the street. It was a big success in Bogota. But few other countries have caught on to this. Like Beijing, China. The most polluted city on earth, is like a giant vortex of smog and trash. They didn't notice yet. And might be one of the few city that find out the hard way when you keep putting smoke in Mother natures face. But our country, America. Is finding out the safe way to travel with less pollutant use. We are trying new and better means of transportation. As in Biking, Carpooling. Or just walking if the distance isn't that tough. Fewer teens these days could honostly couldnt care less about a drivers license. Now they just carpool with other friends or take public transportation. The percentage of peak drivers have descresed to a percentage that of which was around 1995. These pieces of evidence tell us that we can make this world a better place, for the good. Its just a simple step to a bigger door. To where we actually don't have to worry about global warming, or pollution in certain countries. We should just live peaceful lives. And not about whats gonna happen first. Vauban, Bogota, Paris, Asuncion Paraguay. And small parts of the United States have thought about this. When will the rest of us get the picture? Limiting car usage is very vital to pollution and will kick it down a notch. And we could wake up in the morning to see a beautiful glimering sky. Shining its blue flourescent light back at you. Not a giant billowing ball of black smoke that will cover your sky. Turning it into a Gloomy, dull patch of depression on your day. That is why you have to lower your car usage every now and then. Or else, it could end up like that. It might end up as in you make the decision. Or your peers make the decision. You really should consider the darger of what might await you when you step into your car.
