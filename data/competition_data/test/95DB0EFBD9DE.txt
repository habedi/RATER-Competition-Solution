The Facial Action Coding System is an excellent way to analyze different emotions in people, but should it be used in classrooms to identify students' emotional expressions? I think so. Having technology in a classroom that detects emotions of students can be a new way of learning or can help show how today's technology has advanced.

The Facial Action Coding System can help students learn something new: for example the muscles in their faces. The article states, "your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger." The author stated, "muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus makes crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius." This technology can be a very helpful learning system in anatomy or specific jobs like a behavior analysist.

During history class, a student might be dozing off or not even paying attention because the topic isn't interesting to him/her, or they don't understand it. Dr. Huang states "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." The Facial Action Coding System can help students learn more effectively, but also make learning fun to them just by the scan of their facial expressions. The text also states, "Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." This new technology system can make going to school fun, and can demonstrate where their future has to hold for them.

The Facial Action Coding System can be useful any where such as the FBI. Having this new technology system doesn't always help detect emotional expressions, but it can be a new way of learning or can help show how today's technology has advanced and how it is still advancing.
