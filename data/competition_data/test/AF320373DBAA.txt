Dear Principal,

I agree that students should have atleast a B average to join a sports team. I agree with your decision because students will keep their grades up to join, they can join in high school and be prepared, and students will have the chance to do something they like at a cheaper price. But I disagree with your decision also because if a student has a D in p. e., they can join a sports team at school for extra credit in p. e. and anyways, most students have a C average. So wouldn't that be a good idea?

So I agree with your decision because of three main reasons: students will keep their grades high to join, students can try out at high school and be prepared for it, and its cheaper for a student to join at school instead of signing up for a league. What I mostly like about this decision is that its cheaper at a school, but you still get the uniforms and trophies and things like you would get at the league, only cheaper!

Although on the other hand, I disagree with your decision mainly because students can play a sport for extra credit in p. e. and most students have a C average. It would really encourage students to join and raise their grades. It is also better this way so that students playing sports at school can earn more money for the school. So that is why I disagree with your decision.

So wouldn't it be better for the school if we started sports teams? It is an easy way to make money for the school, and students can earn extra credit and still keep their grades up while having fun!
