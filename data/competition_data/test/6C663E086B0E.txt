Dear Principal,

I was looking at the policies you have come up with for cell phones. I think you should consider using Policy 1 because this will give students something to look forward to during the day and encourage them to get their work done in class instead of trying to be taciturn by looking at their cell phones during class. I think that if you allow students to look at and use their cell phones during free time the students will be less tempted to look at their phones during class time and when the teacher is talking or giving a lecture. I also believe that when the students begin to get distracted by cell phones or not focused on schoolwork you should take away the privilege and use Policy 2 so that the students know that having and using a cell phone is a privilege not a right and so that the students understand that they can use their cell phones only when they are succeeding in the classroom. They will also know that they can use their cell phones only during appropriate times when they are in and out of school, whether it be at work or in meetings they will be more respectful of the time they are given to look at and use their cell phones.

I think that if you do use Policy 1 the students will be more respectful of the privilege they are receiving and will use their time wisely so that they can use their cell phones during free times when they are not being instructed by a teacher. I also believe that using Policy 1 will cause less problems with cell phones being used at wrong times. It will also cause less hassle with the students not working because they will be encouraged to do their work so that they can use their cell phone outside of class. So when you read this letter I hope you seriously consider my ideas and thoughts when you are deciding on which policy you decide on.

Sincerely,
