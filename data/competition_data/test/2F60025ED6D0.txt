Dear Principal,

I don't think we should force kids to do community work because some kids need a lot of time in order to do homework, kids have after school activities, and people have to go to religious events. Some people have their kids go places with the parents for a lesson or a surprise.

Firstly, most kids need the time to do homework for the reason that's just how they work. On certain days kids might have a lot of homework and not enough time to get it done, and adding a community service to the equation would make matters worst. If they cant get the homework in their ordinary time schedule, then how would kids get the required community service done and then the homework. I know I need most of the time to do homework, so if I were to get a community service, I might not have enough time to do my homework. Many parents don't have time to do choir after coming home from work. So if parents don't have enough time to do choirs and work, that means most kids really don't have enough time for community service and then homework. I wouldn't want to mess up the balance between time and school.

Secondly, many kids have a after school activity like basketball, running club, track, football and many other things. If kids can barely manage after school activities and homework, kids couldn't be able to fit community service into the schedule. Kids can be stressed from doing to much of those things and not have enough time. I know when i had football games and practice, I had to manage my time by doing all of my homework as soon as i got home. I know most kids can't fit three things in one day. It might be difficult to manage three time into an 7-8 hour time period when one thing might take 3 hours and then another thing takes 4 hours giving kids only 1 more hour.

Lastly, Some people might have an religious study to go to after school. My church has Weekday night bible study. I have barely any time to do my homework before i have to go to bible study. Most kids might have trouble with having too many things to do in one day. I know I had trouble making it on time on bible study nights. I had to stop going to bible study in order to fit football and homework in that day.

In conclusion i have to say, i wouldn't make kids have to do commuity servis
