Dear Principal,

I'm regarding to your decision on weather students will have to do community service? Well it would be a good idea if you provide transportation to the services and to there home. Its a bad idea to do community service because what if some junior or Senior has a part-time job after school they can't be wasting time at community services they would lose there job. It's also a bad idea because what if parents reject to there kids doing community service. What are you going to do then if no one will join. The student body should have a say on what they want to do with there free time. They should not have to pick up trash along a high-way somewhere. Some parents might want to know who's chaperoning. And you might want them to volunteer, then what are you going to do when they have jobs. The Community Service idea is not a good idea!!!

Sincerely,

A unhappy Student
