The face on Mars is just a natural landform. Their's really no existense of aliens, because theres no proof of them. The face is just a landform that was created with Mars. On Earth we have landforms that look like faces and other things that were created with Earth. There's also no proof that there's life on Mars, becuase there really isn't life on Mars.

The existence of aliens is false, humans and animals are the only life forms out there pretty much. If there were proof of aliens then why arn't they on Earth then? Aliens never made that on Mars, that face was created when Mars was. NASA just used the face to get money, because this face was starred in a Hollywood film, it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store check out lines for 25 years. Then after that they really didn't care for the face anymore. Everyone was not really satisfied with the face on Mars.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-- landforms common around the American West. Garvin a scientist even says that it reminds him of the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also says "That's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

As you can see the face was never created or made by aliens. The face was created with mars. In the story, it even says that the landform was basically created with Mars. So in fact there is no existence of aliens and there is no life on Mars.

In the ending of the story, it basically says the face is just a landform, it tells the height and everything about it. They even say that they don't pass over the face that much anymore. So it's just a true fact that the face a landform, they even said it was just a natural land form.
