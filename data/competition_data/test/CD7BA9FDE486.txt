The electorial college is one of the worst things to happen to america. there are so many reasons why but i will just give you three. It does not allow us to vote for president anymore. It's a lazy system. The voters have a right to pick yet it's not up to use it's up anyone who is not in office. The electorial system has just to may flaws.

The first reason is it doesn't alow us to vote for president anymore. The goverment has someone high in power of each state deside even if it's not true its who they want and how they want it. The electorial vote was created by some people high in power. Richard Nixon Jimmy Carter Bob Dole The U.S.A. chamber of commerce the CIO AFL all created the electorial vote mind you that all were know for bad ideas.

The second reason is It's a lazy system. Before some had to count all votes now no on has to count them the leaders of the states do it for them they pick who they feel and thats it. At any point in time there could be a tie because there is an even number of voters. Someone could even lows there presedince even if he gets the most votes.

The third and final reason is the reason that we use the electorial vote. We use it because its cheaper that way. The government wont tell u but its a cheaper way of voting. They know that if we use there way the money will come out of our pockets not theres so the have us use this way in stead.

Well there you have it there is why an electorial vote is bad. I will give them this it is easier. But still there are so many reasons why its bad. We dont even vote anymore the leader of a state does. Its lazy and bab for either candidate. The electorial vote has been and will always be a bad way to vote and a bad thing for America and its history.
