According to the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus." This planet is worthy of the risks and issues of exploration. While the author maintains to cross his point, he uses evidence and facts to change the readers' ideas of this messy planet, by comparing it to more similar terms that are more pleasent to the reader.

First the author starts by explaining and describing the unabitable conditions of the planet. The author states that "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;" Which are refering to the extreme temperatures of "average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit" and the "thick atmosphere of almost 97 percentage carbon dioxide blankets." Second he follows to counterclaim his points by questioning, "If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing fursther visits to its surface?" This persuades the reader to question themselves, What is so bad about Venus? or more important What is so good about Venus? Which he replays and answers by comparing, once again, Venus with our own planet, Earth. He states that, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an "inhospitable planet" to a planet that "was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."

In conclution the author crosses his point by using evidence of a very dangerous, and unabitable planet, and what it once was and how similar it was to what is now our Earth, or also "Venus' twin." As a way to persuade the reader into believing that Venus is worthy of its investigations.
