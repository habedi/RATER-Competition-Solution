Dear Principal,

I think that you should let us bring our phones to school and talk to others on it during our lunch and free times. I think that as long as it is not interfering with our learning ability then we should be able to have them. There are lots of reasons why we should be able to have them during lunch.

I think that if we were to have our phones out at lunch time that the amount of people having their phones would decrease. If we had time during school to talk/text on our phones then we wouldn't be tempted to use it during class. So with the cell phone use at school less people would break the rule of having it in class.

Another reason would also be that we would get to talk to our parents if needed. If we forgot our keys at home and the door is going to be locked when we get home then we would need to call our mom or dad to let them know to leave the doors unlocked, or to bring us the keys to the house. Or we may be feeling a little sick and need to go to the doctor to see what is wrong. I think that it is best for us to call and talk to our mama instead of the people calling and telling them what is wrong with us.

See if we went to the office then we would be wasting their time and if we called then we would cause less confusion.

These are just a few ways that i think we should have our cell phones at school. If u passed the school rule of having our phones out at school then we wouldn't get in trouble for having our phone out in class.
