Acording to the text it's basicly talking about venus and how it's closer to the earth nd how venus is actually a planet.

And it says that venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. In space terms humans have sent mumerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.

I think that Venus is the most populer planet that every one talks about and it seams that is is the closest planet to the sun. Venus and Mars our other planetary neighbor that are closer to the sun.
