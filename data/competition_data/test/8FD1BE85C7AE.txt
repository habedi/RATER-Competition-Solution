Dear state senator,

I beleive that we should get rid of the electoral college. It is unfair to many voters. Because of the winner tak-all system in each state candidats dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focsing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not seee the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Caronlina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markes did not see a single campaign ad. we should also get rid of the electoral college because of the electoral college they lost 60 percent of the voters who would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidtate receives  majority of the votes casted. For example Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43percent purality of the popular votes, While winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 ecetoral votes, there is pressure for run-off when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

But back to electoral college votes being unfair a lot of the states like  wyoming north and south dakota knowing they only get three votes that count some people dont even bother voting, I mean I would not want to if i knew that my vote really was not going to make a diffrence.

so yes electoral college votes are good like how obama recived 61.7 percents of the votes out of the 51.3 percents that Romney got, because all states award the winner take-all system. But I think that we should go back to a direct election to make the voting fare to evryone to keep everyone voting and make them feel like we are still one country.
