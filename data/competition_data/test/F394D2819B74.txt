Dear State Senator

In my opinion we should abolish the electoral college because it's not fair to the people who vote, they vote on the president they want but aren't actually voting for them? Thats crazy we should be able to vote on who we want and it should be counted for. it makes everything much more complicated than it is. As it shows in these documents what would happen if a president won not because of popular vote but the amount of electoral votes.

Is it that their scared of having a tie of votes? If that were to happen the election could go to the House of Reprsentatives, where state delegations vote on the president. What if the people dont like their elector? What if the elector chose one president because they wanted to? There are alot of questions to answer whenit comes to the Electota College,it makes everything easier and fair if we vote directly and the candidate with the most popular vote wins.
