We should be allowed to have cell phones at school during the free periods. We should get to have them when ever we like and we should be allowed to have them on during class as long as they are on silent or something as long as the teacher doesn't hear them on and doesn't see them out. People take phones out when they are at lunch or something when we not in class or around a lot of teachers. So we should be allowed to have them because we need to use them when parents or friends need to find us if we're not around or can't see them outside waiting for us. And if teachers can have phones out during class or at free time we should to. Just to be fair for everyone. But for the people who don't have phones if there friends say then they should be able to use them as well. So I think it a good idea to have cell phones out during the free times and at lunch so we can still talk to friends that are not in the same classes or lunch times as us. But if we can't have cell phones at school then we wouldn't know when the parents are picking us up or if they or coming to get us right after school is out and sometimes people need them to text there parents to see if friends can come over or if they can go home with there friends.
