Dear Principle,

In my own opinion i think that students should not be allowed to have cell phones at school at all. i think this for three reason's, first because kids will most of the time lie to their elders 'as in teachers' about turning of their self phone's during class, and end up using them and getting in trouble. Second reason is because kids will most likely text their friends during class and then, they'll be distracting them from learning and getting educated. And my final reason is because if the child gets their phone taken away, and they have to bring their parents into the problem witch wouldn't have to happen if their wasn't cell phones allowed in school.

My first reason why i think that student shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones in school is because kids will most of the time lie to their elders 'as in teachers' about turning of their self phone's during class, and end up using them and getting in trouble. For example the child with the phone will most likely be using it during class, and that's pretty much wasting his/her time of getting educated. 'Which is the whole reason why students even wake up in the morning and walk or get driven to, too learn.'

My second reason why i think this is because kids will most likely text their friends during class and then, they'll be distracting them from learning and getting educated. For example not only are they distracting them self's, but also other students to, who are trying to pay attention, and grow up with a good education so they can live a good life. And if that happiness, all their doing at school is wasting their time their doing nothing in class.

My final reason why i think this is because if the child gets their phone taken away, and they have to bring their parents into the problem witch wouldn't have to happen if their wasn't cell phones allowed in school. For example during class your child gets their cell phone taken away, which makes a pretty big scene in class, which is distracting every one in class from learning. And if that isn't bad enough, your parents will be called to school to have a conference with the principle. And when your finally home, u get even in more trouble at home by your parents. 'which is not something a kid wants.'

In conclusion i just told you my opinion on why kids shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones in school during class. First because kids will most of the time lie to their elders 'as in teachers' about turning of their self phone's during class, and end up using them and getting in trouble. Second because kids will most likely text their friends during class and then, they'll be distracting them from learning and getting educated. Finally because if the child gets their phone taken away, and they have to bring their parents into the problem witch wouldn't have to happen if their wasn't cell phones allowed in school.
