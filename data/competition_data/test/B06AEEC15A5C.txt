Phones and Driving

Today in society people all have a cell phone to call, text or explore things that may interest them. They also have access to a vehicle (Car, Truck, RV, Etc.) to which they can drive from place to place. Phones and vehicles are the same since both are a privilege to have and are not a basic human right. The use of allowing one to drive a vehicle while he or she uses a phone is an interesting topic to discuss. Both are also what teenagers are expected to get when they reach the age of 16.

In my opinion I believe that phones should not be used while a driver is driving. Driving is important to reduce time to get from one place to another. It can be dangerous to drive if one does not focus on the road. If someone is driving and they waste a second on their phone they could harm or possibly kill someone for not looking who is in front of them. Driving with a phone or in your lap could even distract you long enough to not get the steering wheel and may worsen one's driving skills.

Also if one decides to drive with their phone they are not just putting everyone else at risk, they're putting themselves at risk as well. According to a statistic 58% of teen crashers are because of distracted driving. Meaning that without the use of their phone more than half of teen crashes would be reduced and less harm would be done. Another study states "Text messaging increases the risk of crash or near-crash by 23 times." Meaning that just receiving or glancing at the phone for a second could cause a crash.

However, phones can or should be used only in an emergency. An example is when one needs directions to get to a location that is fine to use the phone. If there is Bluetooth, then connect it to the cell phone if it is compatible to focus more on the road. Or if you need to use your phone just find somewhere to park or stop somewhere and use your phone there. Unless it is for an emergency or something of great importance this is the only time a phone should be allowed.

In conclusion, phones should not be allowed to be used while in a car. Text messages and phone calls themselves cause unnecessary to both civilians and to oneself.
