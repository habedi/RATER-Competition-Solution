You should join this program because you can see new things. When i was on the ship i saw new cool things. The SS.Charles W. Is a great ship. If you join this program you could see China. If you love animals then you need to join this program. We have to take care of lots of animals.

If you love the water,and if you love the Ocean then you will love this program. we are on the water/Ocean 24/7. In August 1945, we recived orders to go to New Orleans. have you ever wanted to go to Europe? Now you can if you join this once in a lifetime opportunity. Trust me you wont regreat joining the program. I know I didn't regreat it. In the year 1947, i had made nine trips and i don't mean to brag about my self but nine trips is more than any other Sea Cowboy. if you join this program you could beat my nine trips. I was a little smal town boy but when i went on a adventure it was a great unbelievable opportunity. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. If you ever get board then just play a game like me and my friends did. Man we played all kinds of things. We played baseball,volleyball,table-tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is munch more than just adventures. you have to have responable and respectfull. One time i fell and brock my ribs. You have to be carefull. So if your responsable,respectfull,carefull and loves water,animals,and the Ocean then you sound perfect for this program. Remember to stay safe and don't mess around. The SS.Charles. W is not a place to be messing around.
