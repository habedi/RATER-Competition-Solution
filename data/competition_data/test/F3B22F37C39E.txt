Has someone ever made you do something you don't want or need to do? Its not fair if someone would make you do something that is not necessary. I think that the principle should not make you do something you don't want to do. Maybe you have other things to do , like play sports or babysit. Not everyone is always free to do something that is assigned. Some people are maybe just to lazy to do community service, but you never know that.

The principle should just let the children decide whether they want to perform community service. Maybe the children's parents would not like for there kid to do community service. Witch would mean that out of all the other kids at school their the only one not doing it. That wouldn't be fair for all the other kids, and they would most likely stop doing the community service that they were assigned. They would just ditch. Witch would lead to many kids to not doing what they were supposed to do. And eventually all the kids that ditched would end up getting in trouble.

Some children might need to study for tests, which would not give them time to do the community service. There are many different reasons why children cannot perform community service. Therefore the principle should let the children decide whether they want to perform community service or not.
