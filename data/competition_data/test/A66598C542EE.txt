dear, principal hi my name is STUDENT_NAME and my opinion is yes all student should be required to perform community service. I said yes because many students don't know what they want to do when they grow up .So the community service will help them chose what they want to do when they get older. for example my friend she still dose not know what she want to do when she gets older so she decide to volunteer at the school and work with the little children at . the next that i came and ask her dose she know what she want to do when she grows up she said" i want to be some one who get involved with kids i did not know i was that good with kids". So with out community service kids will not just help you with community service it helps you with your life experience.

love STUDENT_NAME
