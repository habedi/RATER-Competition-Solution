Imagine walking around with your skull showing. There would be no protection to cover it. The face is what covers it so nobody would see inside your head. The face is just a natural landform.

There is support that the face is a natural landform. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of the landing sites that could be their sister ship Viking 2, when they came up on a shadowy likeness of a human face. A couple days later NASA showed the picture for everyone to see. That's the support that the face is a natural landform.

There is evidence from the article that support my claims. "And so on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time Michael Malin and his MOC took some pictures ten times sharper than the origninal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the picture first appeared on JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There were no alien monument at all." That is edvidence from the article that support my claims.

Others say the face was created by aliens. Photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the red planet in September 1997 eighteen years after the Viking missions ended. However, a picture of the natural landform appeared on the JPL website. Some still didn't believe the face is a natural landform.

The face is just a natural landform. The face is what covers it so nobody would see inside your head. There would be no protection to cover it.
