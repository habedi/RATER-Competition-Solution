Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home with online or video conferencing. Some students think that being able to study at home is better, but others students think that studying at school has more benefit than studying at home. In school, students have better resources, like teachers who are the ones that help students to understand what the class is going to be about and also what significant role that class is going to have in their lives, which is something a computer do not teach. But being able to study at home has more benefit because, Students have more time for their family and also, fighting between problematic students decrease.

Every student around the world has a family, but being eight hours inside school leaves no time to communicate neither to interact with sisters, brothers, mother, and father. For example, in United States every child and youth has to study until the end of four years of high school, but until that time comes, students have no time with their family like birthdays, newborns, church events, and lastly family trips. Every student has to study and share with family because, boys and girls need education and family love. Students from different schools do not like the fact of being inside a school without their family and that is why home school is better than going to school everyday.

In every school there are always fights between students, but being able to maintain problematic students in their houses decreases the amount of fights in every school year. For example, students with violent problems can be supervised by their parents or their guardians, but inside school teachers are not able to supervised the ones with violent or bullying problems. Teachers are not able to supervised every single student because in each classroom there are more than twenty students, but their parents or guardians are able to control them because, parents have more knowledge about the character of each of his or her sons and daughters. And because of that, there is a decrease of fights between bullies and non bullies, and also with the ones that have violent problems.

Students have more benefit while studying at home than at school because, they get more love and caring from their family, and also, the fights between violent kids are decreased because of parents help at watching their sons and daughters inside their houses. Some students think that schools have more benefit to learn than being inside a house and studying without learning, but in the other hand, others think studying inside their houses helps to concentrate more. studying at home helps to maintain the valance in school, between the ones who like to go to school and the ones who like to stay in home, between the ones who love to share with their families or just to stop the violence between students so in that way teachers prevent problems with parents and society.
