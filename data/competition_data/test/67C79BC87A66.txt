Students may not know how to do things when it's necessary or working as a group but, with one extracurricular activity it could help them. This activity will help them with things in life, at home, and at school. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they all work together, learn something new, and all the students will have fun.

They will all work together as a team and will help each other. They all can create a new yearbook working together. One student wouldn't be able to make a year book all on their own but, together as a team it's done faster and may look better. Also they can create something new for the school. Maybe the school looks really boring and could use a touch up, like a mural in a hallway or a quote. The students help with the news for the school. Trying to work a camera is pretty tough to do alone so, it would be great if a group helped. Working alone isn't the same as working as a team.

All the students will probably learn something new that they didn't know before. Many of them could learn a new sport. Some may know how to play sports and some might not but, this extracurricular could help them learn how. Art is something everyone would probably would want to know how to do but, the student could be pretty bad at it. Learning how to draw, make, or create something is a great experience, and they maybe could master it. Fixing cars is something that doesnt come natural to you. Replacing tires is pretty complicated to do however, with the help it'll become much easier. Learning something new is really fun and intimidating.

However having one more extracurricular activity will take up the student time to themselves at home. But, everyone will have fun with each other. You can make new friends with the students that have the same activity as you. The activity you do brings you closer to the students that are in that class. Some students can be stressed out at home. Since you're hanging out with the friends you like, your stress goes away since you're having fun. Students always have fun with one another.

Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It helps them all to work together, learn something new, and have some fun. Students will have a great time doing the activities that they desire.
