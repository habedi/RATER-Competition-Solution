The author didnt support this claim very well. The author talked alot about the dangers in Venus rather the good that comes from Venus. I say this because as I am reading I see how the author mentions many of times how Venus has extreme tempetures and how no one has went to Venus because of these extreme conditions.

The author says in paragraph 2 ,"Numerous factors contribute to Venuss reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us." Which gives the idea that it is a very dangerous place. You may begin to question "Why would any one want to go to Venus" or you may say to yourself "This is not any where that i would want to go." The author also states in paragraph 3," Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere." This is even more if a danger sign. No one would want to be anywhere where you could potentially suffocate. We also know from this paragraph that Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The author states in paragraph 6 ,"Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks." The author gives us tons and tons of reasons why it is not worth going to Venus.

From what I have read today I will never want to go to Venus. The author gave plenty of good reasons on why we should not go to Venus. It is not a place for humas as we have already read. So i feel as if the author did not do a good job supporting his claim on why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present.
