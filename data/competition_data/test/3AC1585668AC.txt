Your principle states that you are required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you think this is a good idea? would this effect you on a daily basis or in real world situations? Participating in extracurricular activities has many factors and I agree with the decision of having all students participate in an activity. There are many pros to having everyone participate because there are many different activities you can participate in also you can learn important lessons and skills also participating in an activity keeps you occupied.

One of the reasons i agree is because there are many different activities to choose from so everyone can find something they enjoy doing. If you enjoy playing sports joining a sports team at your school would be a good a way for you to stay active and create great friendships and bonds with people you play with. There are many different clubs you could join too, If you like taking pictures and being involved around the school working on the yearbook would be a good extracurricular choice for you. If you like making a change or you see a problem at your school joining the school council would be a good way to help your school out and make a change. As I have stated there are many different activities you could participate in so you could always find something you enjoy.

Having kids participate in extracurricular activities can also help you learn many important lessons and skills. Joining an activity can help you become more responsible because when your participating in an activity you have to make sure you stay on task also you have to make sure you are on time and do what your supposed to do. If you follow the rules and tasks you are given, this can help you become more responsible as you get older. You also learn how to make friendships. Having every kid participate in an activity helps people make friendships and talk to other people. This is a good way to interact with others and you can use this skill as you get older. Another important skill you learn is communication. In every activity communication is a big key to being successful in what you do because if your working with other people you need to make sure you understand whats happening and what you need to do so you need communication. As I have stated these are some important lessons and skills you can learn while joining a extracurricular activity.

Participating in an activity also helps you stay occupied and busy. Some activities take place after school so instead of staying home and sitting on your phone or watching TV you get to participate in an activity which gets you up and moving. Also being in an activity keeps you active because if your playing a sport or in a club where exercise is involved that keeps you moving and healthy. Another pro is that sometimes being in activities can be a distraction for you and help you get out of trouble because instead of going somewhere with your friends that can possibly get you in trouble you are doing something productive and good. As I have listed being in an extracurricular activity is a good way to stay occupied and get good things done.

As I have stated these are some of the reasons I think its a good idea for everyone to participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many different activities for people to participate in also you can learn important skills and lessons also participating keeps you occupied. I hope my reasons convinced you that everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea and many good things come out of joining one.
