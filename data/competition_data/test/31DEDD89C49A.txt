Dear principal,

I am a student of your school and i want to tell you which policy i think is better.

i think policy number 1 is good because. that's when students get to have free time and so they wont be getting in trouble. also that way students don't have to be taking it out during class and they know that they can wait till they have free time.

To continue i also think it would also be good because. when many kids be taking them out in class they be getting their cell phones taking away. but if you let students take them out during lunch hour they don't have to worry about getting in trouble.

also some parents want their kids to take their cell phones incase for an emergency. and so that students could call their parents incase they forgot something. further on after their free time is over you can take every student to their locker and make sure they don't have their cell phones so they wont use it during class periods.

and my final reason is because if that way students can avoid getting in accidents in school if they are desecrated in the hall ways. that way students can also get caught up in school work. and not be failing classes.

sincerely your student
