Cars have no doubt become the leading mode of transportation all over the world. Due to the amount of exhaust that they give out, there is a negative effect with greenhouse gases.

Many places in the world have become very polluted due to the pollution that the cars give off. Did you know that Paris, the beautiful city we all know and envision in our minds was once so air polluted that they had to ban driving!? Only certain vehicles were allowed on road at times and eventually when things cleard up they let people back on the road.

Vauban, Germany. A little suburban town that has given up automoblies altogether! "Im much happier this way, when i had a car i was always tense," said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two. Bicycles have become a part of their daily lives and as a result, resteraunts, clothing stores, grocery, and other shops have all sprung up on the streets in walking disatnce making everything easliy more accesible. The town itself is very clean, since they don't use automoblies the effect of pollution is drastically different.

In Bogota, Columbia-There is a program  that they do every year called "

Car-free day ." Car free is a day in which everyone in Bogota..you guessed it, doesn't drive. The people of Bogota care for their enviorment and see a need to take a day out their lives to try and improve it in the slightest. Their determination of upholding this tradition has even brought in someof the neighboring countries to partake in this car free event.

The United States is one of the leading countries in the world for car pollution. Peaking in miles driven in 2005, President Barack Obama took a stand. President Obama set high goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions.
