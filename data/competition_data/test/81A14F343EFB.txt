Hello my name is Jordan and this is my eassy. He had a very well writen "essay" that really makes you think of what venus really had on the surface of its extrem and harsh envierment. The fact that they are thinking of send people to that planet is relly mind blowing to me. He also did an amazing job at discribing the dangers of the planet and all of the extrem caonditions on the surface like the volcanos and earthquakes as mention in paragraph three.

Also how he mentioned how many veachals have been sent to the planet and how they didnt survived the harsh weather for more than a copple hours. It is very intresting how he discribes the way NASA is trying to deal with the challenges.

the way they have made some progress. such as the silicone carbide electronics that can survive in a simulated or replecated venus up tp 3 weeks are mentioned in paragraph 6. My question is would'nt the silicon melt with the heat on venus that is hotter than mars that is closer to the sun. It is very intresting how they have ideas of how they can have people on venus with the hover crafts that the resurchers would stay on and collect information.

Oneday this earth is going to be imposible to live on and we woill have to move to anoher planet or just die off and honestly we have lived for way to long longer than any other type of animal that has ever lived on this earth. we have survived so many things and eras. Many wars have been foght and many men have dies on this eath just fot the sake of defending there country and having the will honor to die with respect. Other animals have gone we have done too much damage to the earth and taken to many animals to extiton and the oceans are extremly poluted many fish are just dying off and peolpe cant seem to know why but the harsh truth is that the wrold is ending and there is no going back now.

Humans hve changed climet pattens and know evey year it seems like the storms are getig stronger and the summers are geting hotter. The winters are taking longer to arive. and longer to leave volcano eruptions are almost common now evry year ut seems like a volcano want to erupt and sometimes it dose other times its just the ash that kills peolpe. What im trying to get at is that we really should'nt be exporing other planets when we dont even know what 98% of our oceans havent even been expored we need to learn how to take care of this planet before we even think about moving on to another planet or we will do the samething. The goverments dont seem to care much about the subject and act like its not happening. In conclution its amazing that we are trying to send men to other planets but not we really shoud'nt no matter how safe or dangeruse it is we need to fix the problems here on earth first.
