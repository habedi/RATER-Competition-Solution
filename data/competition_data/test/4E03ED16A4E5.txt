Luke Bomberger was working at the grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist came up to him and invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke finally said yes when he knew that this was an opportunity of a lifetime. When World War ll was over in Europe they needed people to go to countries to help recover their food supplies, animals, and more,44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. Luke and Don signed up to go on the ship to Europe. They had to be "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke's participation in the Seagoing Cowboys allowed him to experience going to alot of places and exploring them. He went to Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them." But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,"he says. "Besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Luke had a fun time seeing all these places, you can tell by how well he explaines them. By the way he explaines this, he should really be encouraging people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. He makes it sound like it is alot of fun. Luke also found time to have fun on board, the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. By being a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke says that it makes him more aware of people of other countries and their needs."And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.
