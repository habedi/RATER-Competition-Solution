CELL PHONES: The Killer Distraction

We live in a technical world, where cell phones are required accessories. Much like shoes, handbags, and clothes. If you're a technology geek you crave for the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Landline what is that? Extinct like the dinosaurs.

Cell Phones while a necessity for most are dangerous while driving. And have caused major accidents, some ending in death. That's why I refer to them as the killer distraction. Today's society is like a microwave. We want everything instant and ready to go. Most of us are always on the go and not without our cell phones. We can't seem to function without them. It is a mini computer in hand. But why we can't seem to stay off of them long enough while driving?

Have you ever been driving, and another driver almost swerved into hitting you? Then you notice they're on their phone? You get so mad you want to chase them down. I had a friend who was on her cell phone while driving, drop it and end up hitting a fire hydrant. Now what if she had hit a person? She was ok that could have ended in a tragedy for herself or someone else.

Should drivers be able to use cell phones while driving? I have mixed views on that. Cell phones are convenient in many ways. They have GPS to help navigate to desired destinations. Many of us would be lost without it. While driving you might receive an important call. But you can put it on speaker. Most of the newer cars have Bluetooth Speaker and you don't have to hold the phone. In my opinion that's safer, then phone in hand and the other on the wheel.

Now on the other hand. Cell phones are the cause of many accidents which a even fatal . Distractions such as taking eyes the road just for a split second to send a text or to dial a number, can result in a accident. Having a heated argument or getting bad news while driving, can be a distraction a cause an accident. Trying to work GPS can be a distraction that could cause an accident. According to the internet there are 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 caused by texting and driving. It said that texting causes more accidents than drunk driving. Now that's serious and should be a wake up call. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in a fatal accident we're distracted from their cell phones.

Due to the rising numbers in call accident regarding cell phones, most states ban the use of cell phone in hand, while driving. Cell phones is a killer distraction. And not safe to use while driving. Unless you're using your car's Bluetooth Speaker for hand free conversation. And that should be limited because it's still easy to get distracted. While driving we need to be focus on the road and our safety, and those around us. If you must make a call please use Bluetooth or even pull over. Texting while driving is dangerous and unacceptable. Let's not be the cause of another unnecessary accident.
