this is my stance for am i agaist or for using this tecnology to read students' emotional expressions. my anserw is yes we should supoort it. for futher detail on why keep on reading.

this technology could be one of the most benifical things for students. A great example of how it can help is people with depression. If the technology is acurate with its calculations we can help the people that are suffering from depression and are sucidal. The only promblem is how hard is it to hid your emotions from the system. if it is easy to hide from it then it will not help at all. the best way to get the 3-D constructs of ther face would be ethier a test when they sit in front of a computer or blend it in with picture day. in the future every school sould have these so they can figure out what is going on with a student emotions to help them.

that was my stance on if we should be for or agaist the technolgy to read students' emotional expressions. I suppoet this because of the promise the system shows.

I hope that some people dont run it into the ground.
