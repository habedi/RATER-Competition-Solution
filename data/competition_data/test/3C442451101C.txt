Dear principal

I don't really agree with your decision because three are many people that try there best and the still get a c as there average. It wouldn't be fear for them thee are a lot of people that are not interesting in sports and they get A,B most of the time. i think if you were in there feet you would feel very bad. that's why if you change the police there would be people upset and the would be an argument going on.

But then it would be great to change the police because people that have C,D,E,F, well get A,B for order them to secrecies there grades to play and get good grads people well change and make the school better. well that's what i think in between both of them. this is the way i think because people these days are dropping out of school for the bad grade and i think i would be a grate police to change. So the students well have a challenge to look up to. people should always have apartments to try different things.
