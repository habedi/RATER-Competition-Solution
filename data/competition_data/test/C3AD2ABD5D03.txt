The use of technology to read human emotions is valuable because it gave us the benefit, to read others' emotions and to indicate their feelings. According to paragraph 6, From Dr. Huang's statement that " The same techonolgy can make computer -animated faces more expressive--- for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, So coumputers need to understand that, too." He meant the technology is used to understand and communicate human emotions and can be more expressive so that we humans can have understanding with technology. On the other hand some would tell emotions by muscle movement to there fore techonology is not needed to read emotions. According to paragraphs 8 and 9 that talks about how muscle movements helps us to read others' emotions based on telling if a smile is real or forced which indicates if your honest or not. So overall we can say techonology is not valuable to read emotions because there are possiblities for inaccuracy with results, or error to indicate wrong emotions that can have a huge effect on others and results are in doubting range from percise to almost incorrect . So technonlogy is not vaulabe but it is at times but mostly not.
