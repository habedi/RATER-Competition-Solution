Dear Principle,

I have wrote this letter to discuss with you about cell phone use in school.

Cell phones should not be aloud in school at all.

Kids should keep their cell phones in their locker and leave them in their for the rest of the day.

I have suggested this to you for the safety of the everyone.

In this letter I will show how dangerous cellular use during school can be.

In middle school bullying is common.

One of the most common forms of bullying is cyber bullying.

You as a principle would discourage bullying to keep the school a happy safe place.

With cell phones aloud in school cyber bullying will be more common.

Other children may take embarrassing and hurtful pictures of others.

Bulling is very serious and sometimes lead to death and with cell phones aloud in school a students life could be put into jeopardy .

Children and teens are put into school so they can grow up to having a successful life.

Cell Phones are a huge distraction to learning.

Even though the cell phones are not aloud in class kids will still use them in class secretly.

In free time kids should be doing something productive to help them learn.

Instead of reading a book a student would be texting.

Cell phones destroy the school's safe learning environment.

At any school the hallways are a dangerous place while students are trying to get from class to class.

Cell Phones would make the hallways hectic.

Students would be texting while running into each other because they are not paying attention to where they are going.

Someone will get hurt and if it is a serious injury the school could suffer from losing money we need.

Cell phones are a safety hazard and should not be aloud during school hours.

Thank you for your time and I hope that you have taken some of things that i said into consideration for the safety of our school.

Sincerely,

One of your students
