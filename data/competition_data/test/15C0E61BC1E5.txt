Dear whom it may concern,

I do not believe we should be required to do community service. I do believe that we should try to help the community but, I disagree with the fact that it should be required. Some students just don't have enough time to partake in community service. It takes a lot out of our lives. We are still only kids and we want to be able to do kid stuff such as playing games, playing sports and hanging out with friends. We even have the worries of school. I do not believe that we should be required to do something that is meant for older, more experienced persons.

We can help out by picking up trash when we see it, not throw trash on the ground and even help old ladies cross the street. If some students want to participate in community service why not, they should be able to. As for the students who just don't have time should not be forced too. We could have a special day once a year that we go through the town and pick up trash, help teach young minds and, just do community service. I would very much appreciate if you would take what I have to say into consideration.

Sincerely,
