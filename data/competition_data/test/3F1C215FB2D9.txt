Dear Principle,

I feel that you decision to change the sport limit average is a terrible idea.

To back up my thesis i have to decide that its unfair to some children because they may not be as smart as others.

Some may just be doing work when others are doing their best but are still not passing with gold stars.

You also never know if they have a bad home life and need sports to bring them happiness.

But what if they are not smart enough to play.

I also think that a B average is to high of an expectation.

If you to make it a C average it could give the kids a warning that their grades are slipping.

Instead of making the B average an have to.

You encourage the kids maybe saying, " Hey PROPER_NAME, Nice job on the test!

Maybe next time you could study with me in my office and get a B or maybe an A!

Great Job! Keep up the work."

It could also overwhelm the child because he may have to do extra homework and the assignment that day.

Which might not let them play outside which all children need. Also to maintain a B average it would take a lot of work and maybe the kid works on a farm and has no time for homework during the day because he has to work all day after school.
