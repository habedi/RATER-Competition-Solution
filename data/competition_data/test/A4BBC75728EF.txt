Dear Principle,

The students of our school heard that you may be considering making changes to our school sports and activities because of grades. My piers, as does myself does not agree with this change that may be made. You and all of the teachers know that some kids strive to do well in school so they are able to be apart of other things. Some of the kids are more athletic, musical, and creative then academic; therefore it would not be fair to pull it away from students who are now trying their best in school because of outside activities. Yes, some people may have C averages, but if this is showing their best work then I think you should be encouraged that they are working to their highest standards.

It is not fair for students to not be able to afford outside sports to now have their way of playing be cut. Yes school is mainly academic and most people should focus on that, but I believe that it is important to have other activities. I have played soccer and track for the school. It was good for me because I got to know more people that went to our school and socialize. We all know that school is not the place where we want to come and have no friends. This is why it made a good time to enjoy school while still getting an education. Gym is a class that is mandatory in our school system, but you do not get to work as a team as much as sports. It does make sure you are in shape but it is not as much fun as other sports you are able to play.

This is why I think that if you want to play sports, then you should have a C Average. Even though sports do take up time, they will know that they need to do well in school. Pushing themselves physically and mentally I feel will get them ready for the real world. High school sports are also important for college if that is what you want to focus on. School should be about what you want to do in the future and not just all grades now. It is important to have good grades, and if sports are what is pushing you, then I think it should be acceptable. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
