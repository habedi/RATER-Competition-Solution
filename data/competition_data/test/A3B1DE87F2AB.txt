In the midst of the great education reforms being implemented throghout the American schools, students are now more than ever profitting of the usage of technology into the evoloving schooling sytem. However, one problem still remains, as summer starts, students tend to forget the material that they have learned last year, thus causing most students to enter the year severely underprepared. As a result, teachers coupled with students have proposed the Summer projects to continue learning during the break. But on the note of the responsibilty, it is quite obvious that it should be through the teacher's discretion as teachers can gauge the level of the content needed for the student to be caught up to speed in the class and can also decide the necessary quatity of the content for the best in depth review or introduction needed for the success in the class.

As it is no surprise that students during their break are less inclined to work on the given school topics, the responsibilty of the project must rely with the teachers. Furthermore, the teacher's discretion is imperative and valued more than that of the student's as the teacher has accumalated more experience and has taught the class before enabling the teacher to provide content that is likely the most helpful for the class. Similar to a situation of a job interview, the interviewers will most likely choose the more qualified and experienced person similar to that of the teacher, as the teacher provides a more quality insight that is valuable to the assignment opposed to the student who has never taken the class before to assess the design of the summer project. Additionally, referenced in the book the

Crucible by Sir Arthur Miller, the town amidst the public hysteria of the witch, listen to the village elders or the religious heads as they are the most experienced and are able to vison what is best for the community throughout the book, further higlighting the point that the teachers are able to gauge the intellectual capabilites of the students and best envision the materials needed to create a succesful classroom environment.

With teachers as the primary entity that could design the most helpful project, teachers are able to conduct a simulation of what the class entails coupled with the accurate coursework implemented through the quantity of the project. Furthermore, through the quantity of the project, the teacher enables the student to decide whether the class is suitable for the student's time table or interests coupled with the best in depth review and introduction prior to the class for optimal learning conditions. On the contrary, if students were to design the summer project, the project will likely not entail the necessary requirements including the least possible work quantity wise, along with misinterpreted information because of the lack of experience in taking the class. Similarly, work ethic and motivation will likely also increase as, the higher the quantity of the assignment the more motivation it requires to surmount, developing needed skills in both school and the workforce. Hence, with the teacher's design the student will not only better his knowledge on the topic but determine whether the class is for the student and increase quality life skills that are imperative.

While some say that with the students able to design his/her own project, they are able to self-evaluate their weaknesses prior to the class, it is imperative to know that on the contrary, teachers can apply their experience on the matter by demonstrating techniques that may have worked on other students to the student to better their weaknesses. Furthermore, while students may also be able to enhance self studying on the topic, the teacher is able to create an accurate simulation of the course in the project along with clearing any misinterpreations that may have been used by another source by giving the questions and answers the way the teacher wants it in the future. Additionally, with the teacher designing the summer project, the teacher is able to provide easier methods in which a problem can be solved through their vast experience on the matter.

Therefore, to close the argument, teachers should be able to design the summer project given to the students as the the teachers are able to provide a simulation of the class and coursework, apply their vast experience on the matter to simplify the students' assignement, and deem the quantity and quality of the assignement that is just right for the students to excel in the class in the future and polish their skills that they learned the year prior as teachers hold students' success at the forefront.
