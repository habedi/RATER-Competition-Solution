When it's summer it basically means freedom for all kids. But there are some schools who do give their kids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their break and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can make time to work and pick their own deadlines, make their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.

Students should be able to make time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.

Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already know what they need to know, and by making them do something they don't know at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't know during the school year and now they have to learn it during there break.

A teachers goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to make their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.

Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it.Â
