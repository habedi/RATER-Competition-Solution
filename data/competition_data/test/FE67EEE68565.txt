In "The Challenge Of Exploring Venus," the author uses many details to suggest how venus is important to explore even though the risks are extremely high.

The first example of how the author proves that venus is worth exploring is in paragraph 4 the author states, "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." The author uses this quote from NASA in the article to show how even though they know its extremly risky, people are still trying to find solutions rather than leaving the problem.

The second example is in paragraph 7, "NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for 3 weeks in such conditions." This example shows how the scientists are so curious in Venus that they simulating the harsh conditions to make strong technology to survive on Venus.

The third example is in paragraph 8, the author states "Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." The author uses this example to summaraize that if we take the time and make the technology to explore Venus, then good things could come out of the solutions.

In conclusion, the author uses all these examples and more to greatly explain why exploring Venus even though scientists are very aware of the many dangers, is such a good idea to invest time into.
