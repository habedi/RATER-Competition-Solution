Phones and driving

It is reported that cell phone use while driving leads to millions of crashes each year, and that's sometimes due to drivers trying to use their phones at any given time of the day, whilst behind a moving automobile. Even though smartphones have made it easier for people to stay connected, there's no need for letting the ins and outs of smartphones to run their lives. The distraction rates of cell phones are alarmingly high, given the fact that the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Those reasons stand alone, as to why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle.

Recent general cell phone statistics states that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Operating a vehicle requires someone to be fully focused on their surroundings, as they are not only driving for themselves, but every pedestrians and motorists. Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road and that's all it can take for and accident to happen within the blink of an eye or even worse, a causality.

94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving, and rightly so, it's bad enough that there are many distractions when driving, but eliminating one of the biggest distractions, is the beginning of heading into a right direction. The behavior of using cell phones while driving is common and dangerous.

In conclusion, to the many dangers of driving, cell phone should be on of the top priorities to eliminate. With the help of drivers who support this claim, it should be even more of a indication, because as sad as it is, people are not as educated about phones and driving, as they could be.
