I thinks all of you should come on the seagoing cowboy project. I have expericed many cool things and have learned to take care of animals. The sea going trip was the best time of my life.

There were many dangers at sea but I had trained for all of them. There were also some fun times were we played baseball, table-tennis, boxing, reading, and whittling in empty holds where there were no animals. I got to wake up every morning and go out and watch the sea and feel the cool mist on my face it felt wonderful. I had much fun on this trip.

The seagoing cowboy trip has many things to offer if you are a cowboy it is great for you if you are a sailor you can do this trip as well. Going on this trip you will learn many resposibilites. You can also learn to take care of the animals.

The travaling took some time but if you traviling you will love this program. I saw many amazing things that without this trip I would not of seen. I saw iconec land marks and met some pretty cool people. This trip was the best.

Taking care of the animals was much fun. The animals kept me busy that is for sure. If you are into animal care-taking this is the trip for you. It was also much fun going to new places and getting called sea cowboy.

The reasons above prove why you should join the sea cowboys. The cowboy teaches how to be a cowboy, how to be a sailor, and teaches you resposibilites.
