In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", it describes how this new technology called the "Facial Action Coding System" can identify human emotions and how it's is a very useful piece of technology. I have to agree, this new technology can be very helpful to many people.

For example, in paragraph six line six to eight it says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" (Dr. Huang predicts). "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". This not only can know how students are feeling about a certain lesson or problem in class, but can also ajust it's way of learning to a way that is best understandable for the students. Once sadisfied, and the computer reads that the student is "happy" with it, they'll finally be able to learn more and get a lot of their work done. Not only is this a really spectacular piece of technology, but a very useful one at that.

Reads a persons emotions, modified lessons to fit a student's understanding; once satisfied or "feeling happy" with it, a student can then work easier along with getting a lot more work done. I mean, does this not sound very useful and benificial to many people, to many students. This new piece of technology is going to help many students, and I for one would love to use the "Facial Action Coding System".
