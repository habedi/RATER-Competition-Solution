Everyone needs to learn, no matter your age, size, color. Every person is unique and therefore has a unique way of learning. Distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Which could be a great alternative for kids who don't deal well with school.

One good reason would be transportation, not everyone lives close to a school and can get someone to take them to school, or have a bus stop in range of their house. Depending in what grade you're in school can start very early. As a high school student myself, I have to get up at 5:30 in the morning just to catch the bus, and I still miss it some mornings.

Also, kids can be ruthless at times and relentless with their bullying. I've experienced it myself; I've seen kids bullied so badly they had to transfer schools.

School isn't for everyone, It's better for kids to have a suitable learning environment according to their needs and situations instead of having them suffer in a school that's not good for them. This is why distance learning is a great alternative and you should consider moving your son/daughter to it if necessary.
