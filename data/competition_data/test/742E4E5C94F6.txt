"I have nothing to do after school," cried Generic_Name,"I'm gonna be so bored." "You should tryout for soccer!" exclaimed Generic_Name. Generic_Name wasn't keen on the thought of trying out for soccer. "I mean, I'm not very athletic, and I don't have very good foot eye coordination." Generic_Name said wearily. "That's okay. Just try it, you never know, you might enjoy it." Generic_Name said, trying to motivate Generic_Name. Confidently, Generic_Name responded with, "Okay, I'll try it." All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.

To start with, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them make new friends. This is important because it can help a student who struggles socially. For example, say that you don't make friends very well. Joining a sport or a club will help you find someone who shares the same interests as you. Another reason is that it will help students become close with students that aren't in their grade. For instance, almost all school activities are open to all grades. This is the only time students will be able to socialize with the grades above or below them. So it's important that they take advantage of it. Lastly, it's important that students make new friends because it can help them become more involved in school activities. To emphasize, I ran track my eighth grade year. My friends motivated me to tryout. I ended up loving it and making so many new friends with sixth and seventh graders.

Secondly, requiring students to join a school activity will keep them busy. To start of with, when students are done with their homework they immediately go on their phone. To fix this problem, keeping students busy with a sport or a club will prevent them from being on their phone to much. Moreover, so many kids complain of being bored and not having anything to do after school. This is because they're not busy. To support my opinion, during track season I never complained of not having anything to do. I was always occupied either with homework or I was at practice. The last reason why it's important to keep students busy is because it gives them the opportunity to practice their time management skills. To illustrate, at the beginning of track season I was very stressed about how I was going to complete all my homework. By the end of the season I knew how to manage all my time and didn't have to stress on how I was going to finish my homework.

Finally, requiring students to participate in a club or sport gets students get out of their comfort zone. Getting students' out of their comfort zone is important because it prepares them for the work force. To elaborate, in the work force you don't get a choice whether or not you do something. You have to do it, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Another reason is that putting yourself out of your comfort zone can make you grow into a more confident person. For instance, I joined MAC committee when I was in eighth grade. Talking in front of a whole class made me uncomfortable. Now that I look back at it, it was worth it. I'm so much more confident as a person.

Another reason is that getting out of your comfort zone can change your point of view. To illustrate, my friend's parents forced him to join the art club. At first he thought it was weird and only for the "geeks". Joining the art club changed his whole point of view. He now loves art and wants to pursue it as a career.

"This is so fun!" Generic_Name exclaimed, as she kicked the soccer ball. "I told you, all you had to do was get out of your comfort zone." Generic_Name responded. "Yeah, you were right. I'm so happy that you encouraged me to do this. I've made so many new friends and found out I really enjoy playing soccer." Generic_Name agreed, "Me too. Soccer keeps me busy and off my phone." In conclusion, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.
