"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!" ("The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"). Most suporters of the Electoral College don't understand that electors are not always honest, just because people vote for the elector that is for the presidental candidate they favor of doesn't garentee the elector's vote. "What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral College!" ("The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"). People want to eliminate The Electoral College, and change to election for President of the United States to election by the popular vote. The public is not voting for their presidental candidate, they are voting for the foisting electors, and in the case of a tie, the House Of Representatives are thrown the election, where people are not proportionally represented.

Furthermore, voting for electors is not the same as voting for the presidental candidate. "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes" ("The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"). This process called "The Electoral College" is faulty and not efficacious; people are constantly deceived that they are voting for the presidental candidate, but as shown this is not always true. Not to omit anything, voters don't choose who the eletors are, so who can garentee their loyalty, honesty, and the fulfillment of the will of the people. "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)" ("The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"). The deception and defyment can not be more evident and clear. The Electoral College is not a stable foundation to rely our country on. "In the same vein, "faithless" electors have occasionsally refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." ("The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"). Their defyment and inevinable deception is clear and pellucid; The Electoral College should not be trusted! The people should vote!

In continuation, in the case of a tie in electoral votes the House of Representative would be responsible for choosing the president and vice president, but their method is just as outragous as The Electoral College. "Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters" ("The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"). In what world in this sensible, sane, or intellegent? Well, it seems this ubsurd representation can be found on a planet called Earth, whose inhabitants claim to be intellectual beings. "Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 voters would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from a castastrophe" ("The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"). People are told that "voting makes a difference", but with all these false representations, can people continue to say this without becoming a liar themselves. With all these holes in the ship, howcome The Electoral College hasn't sunken yet. The majority is in favor of switching the process of election for President of the United States to election by the popular vote.

To conclude, the transition from "The Electoral College" to election by the popular vote for the President of the United States would be the best thing for this beloved country. Voting for electors is not the same as voting for the desired candidate, and in the case of a tie the House of Represenatives unproportionally represent the will and voice of the people. Voters should be allowed to vote and be represented justly, and not defied and deceived into voting incorrectly or indirectly. Let the people be heard, when they chant in unicen: "Let us Vote". The president who says he is "For the people" should be chosen "By the people".
