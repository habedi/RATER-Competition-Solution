I would agree with the principal about participating in one extracurricular activity so people can have fun, make new friends,and try out new things. I think participating in an activity would be a good way to go out and meet new people. You can meet people who are very fun to hang out with. It would be a good way to open out and instead of staying home you can be at school doing after school activities. For example I use to be scared doing after school activities because I was new and I didn't know anyone but I signed up for football and i got to know other people and I started to like playing football. I also stayed for other sports and I met so many people and got closer to them and I was really happy because I wouldnt have to be home being bored all the time.

Trying out new things would also be fun and you can learn how to play a new sport and become good at it. Other activities like the year book is also fun because you can be creative with the book. Doing the year book can teach you many things and it can let out a lot of stress and can relax you. I would also find it fun doing the year book because I've always wonder how you make the year book and when they come out they always look very pretty.

I think it would be fun for people to try new things to be adventurous and stay at school doing fun activities. It's fun playing or being creative and being around people who are also fun. Participating in activity would also be a good idea because you can be doing something good instead of being outside probably doing something bad or doing nothing at all. So yes, I would agree with the principal of participating in a activity.
