Dear Mr. Principal,

Students with a grade average of lower than a B should not be allowed to participate in sports or activities unless the activity could help the student obtain a higher grade average.

This is because students should be more focused on receiving the best education possible than playing sports or doing other activities.

This new policy would encourage students to bring up their grade average if it is below a B.

If he/she wants to do an activity that their friends are doing, but can't because their grade average is too low, they will have incentive to improve their grade so that they can participate.

If we don't establish this policy, students whose grades are below a B will be allowed to do the activities and will most likely continue with their bad habits (not doing homework, not studying for quizzes/tests, etc.) as the result of a lack of incentive to improve.

More students who are below a B need to realize how important their education is and improve their grade.

Also, not approving this plan would undermine good students who maintain an average a B or better.

if these students have friends that play sports and have averages worse than a B, they may realize that they don't need to be getting good grades in order to be rewarded.

These students may then begin to fall behind in class because they know that this won't disqualify them from intramural activities.

This new policy is needed to restore a feeling of purpose in students to get and maintain good grades in school.

Sincerely,

Concerned student
