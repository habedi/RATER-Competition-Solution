In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author does a great job at evalutating his idea of Venus and its dangers. No spacecraft has ever survived the landing of Venus for more than a few hours and if that is the case then surely a human could never survive that so it seems.

The carbon dioxide, temperature and pressure is just one of the many dangers of Venus as the author clearly describes. The atmosphere, according to paragraph 3, is about 97% carbon dioxide. On the planets surface, it is also 800 degrees fahrenheit. Just these dangerous factors of Venus makes me believe humans will most likely never step a foot on the planet.

In paragraph four, the author discusses the interest in exploring this planet further despite all of the dangers. Astronomers go on to believe that Venus used to be quite earthlike with lots of oceans and could have possibly supported some sort of life. It includes rocky mountains, valleys, and craters as well. The author states that "the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"

In paragraph five the author describes to us the solutions NASA and other astronomers are trying to come up with to be able to explore planet Venus. They want to try to avoid its terrible conditions on the surface and avoid as much pressure as possible by creating a floating aircraft to hover over Venus. The author states "Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." There is conflict however because there would be no way to retrieve any samples of rock or gas from this distance.

In conclusion, I believe the author did a wonderful job of supprting his idea about planet Venus. I learned a lot by reading this article and have become more interested in Venus and its conditions. The author presented a problem and gave some solutions to the problem that NASA is still continuing to work on.
