Extracurricular activities may interest some students at schools, but not everyone likes the idea of doing things after school or during school. If the principal of your school decided that it was required for everyone to participate in at least one activity after school, would you be for or against it? I would be against this idea because many students have other things to do that are more important than activities like sports or yearbook staffs. Students may have rough times in their lives that require for them to attend to their family's needs, or it could be they are very busy and need time for other things like church or even family time, and finally students may have to make important, unscheduled trips if an emergency occurs.

Rough times in a students life sometimes makes them unable to attend certain school activities even if they are required by an administrator. It may be the students needs to work to pay for food, or the house needs to be cleaned because the parents are working overtime. No matter what the principal may say, family is much more important than a meager after-school activity. Any occurrence in a students life that requires they be home to help is completely understandable, and they should get the full support of the school.

Being overloaded with work also contributes to the fact that students shouldn't need to be enrolled in after school activities. Homework is almost always given to students to test their knowledge and what they learned, this is a leading factor in being busy and unable to be part of a after-school activity. Church or non-school-related events also make extracurricular activities more difficult to be a part of. Family time and curfew also relate to unavailability for after-school events.

The unexpected can also contribute to a student being unable to participate in after-school activities. A family member may have been involved in a car crash or shooting, a loved one may pass away, or even a beloved pet can easily make extracurricular activities a big no to some students. Students may have to attend a funeral, or rush to the hospital to see a loved one. After-school activities makes this harder for the student.

In conclusion, students should not be required to be involved in extracurricular activities because students may have rough times in their lives that require for them to attend to their family's needs, or it could be they are very busy and need time for other things like church or even family time, and finally students may have to make important, unscheduled trips if an emergency occurs. No matter what it be, after-school activities should be optional, not required.
