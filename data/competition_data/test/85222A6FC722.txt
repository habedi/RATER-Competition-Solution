Phones & Driving

While driving, drivers have to focus on the road so they can see where they are going, but if they're staring at their phones they could get into a serious accident. When teens get into car accidents, it is likely due to them paying more attention to their phones then the road. Operating in-hand a cell phone while driving is against the law and there is a punishment for it. Driving in a crowded area while on your phone can lead to a car crash that will injure a lot of people. Many pedestrians die due to getting hit by distracted drivers who are on their phones. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they can injure themselves and others.

Using a hand-held mobile device while driving is illegal. When driving or riding a vehicle, you should not use or be distracted by your mobile phone. If you use your mobile phone when driving you risk prosecution for not having total control of your vehicle. The hands-free law is when a driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone while driving. Drivers should know this law when they get their driver's license. The hands free law is there for a reason and that reason is to keep people safe.
