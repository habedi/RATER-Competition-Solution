Hey i am here to talk about what i think this suspicious face is. i think it is probably a real face proving there is little life on mars. I think my statement is correct because, what else would it be. It is an old face grounded into Mars. It proves there is life on Mars even though it could poswsibly be an alien. It is either a human being or alien possibly inside of this planet with their face sticking out perminately. This suspicious face could be anything that was alive at one point. there probably isnt any life on Mars because the photograph was taken from an airship. So it it most likely an alien. If it was a human, he probably died instantly.

my inference now is it is an alien. because, the face was located 41 degrees north martian latitude. The face seems to be in a very random spot to be seen. My inference is it is an alien. however you never know

Now i personally think it is or was an alien. the face looks very plain and in a random spot for a human to roam. the altitudes have no life on them, Mars has no life on it. So either a human died instantly or an alien died of natural causes. i am going to go with the alien. what human being would be on such high altitudes.
