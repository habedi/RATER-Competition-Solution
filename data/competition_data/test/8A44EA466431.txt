Dear Principal,

I think that you should enforce policy #1.

You should do this because cell phones at lunch and other free periods aren't really bad at all as long as their used appropriately.

I think you should have a list of rules implying the use of cell phones in school. The penalty for cell phone use in class should be an automatic 3 days of detention and banning the individual of using his phone for a month at school period. After applying the rules to students you should try to convince them of positive ways to use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods.

For example you could persuade them to use the schools wifi and free internet to get work done involving research and use of internet.

You should experiment with the idea for maybe 3 months and determine rather or not you like the outcome of the project.

Many students will love you a lot more if you would just consider policy #1 as a thought.

Sincerely,

Fan of policy #1
