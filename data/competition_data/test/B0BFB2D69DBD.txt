I think that students should have a activity at school because it help you have fun,make new friend.

If you do a school activity you will have fun there are many things you can do like join a sports team or a club. in a sports team you play the sport like football,baseball,basketball,and others. if your not into sports you can join a club. in a club you have different clubs there are a lot more clubs than sports like board games club, red cross club and many others and than what makes actives fun

In an school activity you will meet people that have the same likes as you because your in the same activity. you might know some one in the activity but, you could meet new friends meeting new people is a good thing it helps you meet new people.

school activity are fun and can be changingÂ and kids need a brake from school and do there activity and thats why i think school should make kids do an activity.
