Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because a lot of people have lost their lives for that exact reason. " Over 3,000 people were killed in accidents caused by distracted driving"...(CarpeyLaw. com) I think this example supports the reason because it shows how many people lost their lives. "Everyday in the united states around one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers, and around 1500 are injured in some way in crashes by the irresponsible, distracted drivers"...(CarpeyLaw. com) This is a great example because it shows how people can lose their lives due to the ignorance of other people.

Another reason why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because a lot of people have lost their lives for that exact reason. "If you are pulled over for texting and driving, you will be issued a fine"...(CarpeyLaw. com) This is a perfect example why you shouldn't text and drive because there will be consequences. "Dana trammell, 17, was texting someone on her way to her first day of school of senior year when she crashed and was thrown from her vehicle. She was pronounced dead at the scene"...(TextingnDriving. com) If she would've followed the law she would've made it to school happily and still have her life.

There are so many more accidents of people losing their lives to texting and driving. "Chelsea Ann bragg, 16, was killed in a rollover crash after texting while driving, She veered off the shoulder of the road and then lost control of the car..."(TextingnDriving. com) This example also shows not only are you putting your life in jeopardy you are also putting other people lives in the vehicle in jeopardy. "Ashley D. Miller, 18, veered into oncoming traffic and hit another car head-on while she was texting. She and the other driver, a 40 year old mother of 1, were killed instantly"...(textingndriving. com) If she was watching the road like she was supposed to be that child would still have their mother.
