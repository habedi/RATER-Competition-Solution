Dear TEACHER_NAME

I would try the first policy to allow students to bring phones to school and user them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I think you should pick this policy because during free time like in the morning during P.E or at the end of the day. we need something to do so we don't get in trouble for talking. As you know texting is the most popular thing people like to do these day's. Students like myself will not talk on our cell phone unless its an emergency. Other than that most students will not talk on cell phones. Students should be able to us our cell phone during school hours besides teachers us there cell phones to call friends or text them. Most people would most like text or be on the internet on face book, myspace, tagged, or twitter. This is why I think you should pick this policy I hope iv
