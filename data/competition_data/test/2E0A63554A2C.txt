Should drivers be able to be on their phone while driving? My opinion to that question would be no for many reasons. You shouldn't have any distractions while driving. Way too many people are killed in car accidents and there doesn't need to be any other distractions while driving. Driving while using a cell phone is a vision distraction, it's law enforced, and it's a hazard to other drivers.

Any form of usage on a cell phone while being in the car is dangerous in many ways. Drivers need to sit back and think is texting or calling anyone at this very second worth a risk of taking or endangering not only my own life but risking it for any one else's.

Using a phone not only causes danger, but causes many forms of distraction and disorder. It can be physically danger in and kind of situation, it is mentally distracting depending on what the cause is, and can even become an issue not only with the protection of human but a problem with the law. Doing anything on the phone in that very moment is not worth taking anyone, yet their own life's but yet not worth getting into trouble that could've been avoided.

It's safer to have someone in the car with you, talking to you rather than you being on your phone. The passenger in the car can keep you company and keep you entertained. A cell phone will distract you and you could take your life and even someone else. Being on your phone could make you drive slower and cause other vehicles to pass you and that could cause an accident.

Drivers should not have in their possession at any time a cell phone. It's too much of a risk. There is no need for a snapchat or a game can't wait in order to not take you own life or someone else's. There is enough distractions while driving without it being a phone. A phone only makes it all worse.
