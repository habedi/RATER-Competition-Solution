Summer assignments are a dreaded topic for many students ranging from middle school to college to even think about. Students do not realize how helpful these summer assignments can be to their inactive brains during the summer. The summer assignments are almost a warmup for the brain. During the summer most students are focused on many things such as vacation, work, and having fun with friends. Throughout all this, their brains forget a lot of knowledge and need refreshing. If students designed the summer assignments, the designated assignments would be too easy and would not really help the students to think and grow academically or get them ready for their upcoming school year. The summer assignments should be created and assigned by teachers because the assignments can target certain goals such as refreshing the kids' brains on what they learned the previous year, the assignments can introduce the students to a new topic area, and it can give the teachers an understanding of where the students are individually.

After not learning or reviewing information, students' brains go into hibernation mode and start to forget everything that has been learned. Kids often have trouble with classes such as math or science because those are two subjects that build upon each other. Meaning in math, you have to know Algebra 1 before you do Algebra 2 because there are certain skills and formulas that are needed for the future. Having summer assignments created by teachers would help the students to remember and practice those formulas, skills, and problem solving tools often learned throughout a year. There is the same occurence in science classes as well. Biology 2 grows and often goes into more depth on certain topics from Biology 1, meaning that if you forget what you learned in Bio 1 then you might not understand what is going on in a Bio 2 class. With summer assignments created by teachers, students will get a refresher on what they learned in the previous year and will be able to learn and grow in their new classes.

When a new school year comes looming over students theres always a bit of excitement and nervousness. Learning new things everyday can be a scary thought especially after having a long and enjoyable summer. If teachers were to create summer assignments that introduced students to new topics, then those scary thoughts of learning a whole school years worth of information may not be so frightening. Introducing new topics to students can help the students to prepare and really understand what they would be learning the upcoming year in that class. For example, if a student decides to take a hard history class like AP Government, but are not really sure what the class is about, a summer assignment that targets the introduction of governnment can give the student a good understanding of what they will be learning, how hard the class will be, and give the student time to prepare and even get ahead on the class. This would make the student feel prepared for this challenging class and feel less scared and anxious about the upcoming school year.

Teachers have so many tasks that they have to do throughout the school year and often do not have the time or energy to think about each student individually and how to help those kids who may be struggling a little more than the rest. Creating summer assignments from a teachers perspective could help the teachers to look for, see, and help the students that are struggling. With summer assignments created by teachers they can see who is struggling and help those students before the school year even starts. If students were to create the summer assignments, they would not realize that they are the ones who are struggling and may need help. Having difficult yet acheivable summer assignment can show educated and experienced teachers which students may need more individual help whether that is staying after school, explaining topics in more detail, or even having a meeting with the kidand their parents explaing to them what they could work on to become better students.

Summer assignments being created and assigned by teachers is the most logical because the assignments can target certain goals such as refreshing the kids' brains on what they learned the previous year, the assignments can introduce the students to a new topic area, and it can give the teachers an understanding of where the students are individually. These reasons for teachers to create the summer assigments do not only create the positve outcomes explained above but many more. For example, noticing that a student may need more help than others can help that student to learn new ways of being a better student, it can help the student realize that they need help in the first place and it can make the student less scared about thier upcoming year.

All of these positive outcomes caused by teachers creating the summer assignments can help the student to get the most of their school year, help them to feel more confident, and hep them feel ready to not only pass but extraordinarliy succeed.
