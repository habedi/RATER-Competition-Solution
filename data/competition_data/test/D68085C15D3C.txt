Dear principle,

I have to say that choosing labored work over being an unrespectable student towards helping the community just shouldn't fit with out school. Kids need an education and a respectful attitude to continue on in life. Some examples would be; getting a job, giving love to your community, and showing young kids a good role model.

When getting a specific job as a teen is simple, you can work at Burger King, McDonald's, or any other fast food restaurant, and knowing you have good spirit in your heart for cleaning the community shows one person what a real change can do. Being a positive affect on people around you, friends or family members, can show them to clean up a mess here or there. It brings a joy, when an older person, knows what they can do to bring that joy in the job they gave that one young child. If one chooses not to have a job, to live life without a show of care, then they aren't getting anything and are affecting people around him or her with that negative affect, which makes people not care or make a person hate on what should be loved.

Giving love to your community is simple. All a person has to do is show it! When you clean the community, it knows you really want a good change on that one place. The community is dirty all the time, so why not stop being lazy and put on some gloves and put on a changed attitude. Going outside or inviting friends can be successful on how one cleans up. Maybe, you want to pick up a wrapper on the floor, or throw away that dirty shoe someone lost at the park. Growing up loving the community puts a positive change in everything around your life. One may want to clean around their house and let other people have something worth looking at. Now is the time to clean your school's yard, or your yard at home.

Young kids don't know what they are doing when they drop garbage on the ground, but with a strong older brother or sister, telling them what's wrong with that being there can show there minds, "oh, I shouldn't be throwing stuff on the ground, it's wrong!" And it turns their brains for the greater good in life. When a young kid doesn't know what's up, then they won't be positive, but a negative. They will treat the world, like it never matters, and destroy what other people love in the community. Many people won't want that affect and try to teach their kids right from wrong. It brings out a strong change when a child has a role model to help them out.

Now, I know that many students still won't change from one letter, but principle its up to you, and how you change the students in this school. I will try and put that positive affect on people who think with negative minds, but I rest assure this paper should change some hearts. Showing love, having a good job and being a good role model is what the community needs from this point on.
