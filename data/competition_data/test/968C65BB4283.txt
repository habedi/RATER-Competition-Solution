Dear Principal,

I think the first policy is the better one to use in our school. Its a good way for are school to use cell phones. If we could not be able to bring our phones to school then what would we use to call are moms and dads after school sports and call them to tell them when to pick us up. If we could not bring our phones to school at all then how would we be able to any of thing like that. And say if we had to call are friend after school to let them no they forgot there book or to tell them that they can ride home with. It would make it better for the teachers to so then we don't have to use there phone in the class room and making them stop doing what ever they where doing before. And if your are not feeling good and you need to call your mom to come pick you up so you can go home this way you can just call your mom or dad and not have to go all the way down to the main office and stop what ever they where doing and keep going with there day.

So thanks for taking your time and reading this i hope that you take your time and think about this.
