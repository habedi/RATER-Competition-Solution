The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a shadowy likeness of a face. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa.

MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his MOC captured a photo ten times sharper than the orginial photo. The image appeared on a JPL website which revealed it was just a natural landform. That meaning there was no alien monument. The pictre shows the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West. It reminds Garvin of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

It is a lava dome which takes place of an isolated mesa, the lava dome is about the same height of the Face on Mars

In conclusion the Face on Mars was not created by aliens or any other life form. It was a natural occurance on the surface and the shadows from the sunlight created spots on the "Face" to look like an egyptian pharoah. Therefore the Face on Mars was not created by aliens.
