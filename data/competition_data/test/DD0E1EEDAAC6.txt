In my opinion, driverless cars would be extremely dangerous in certain situations. Especially with teenagers drivers. This invention could have a very bad outcome. Cars without drivers is pointless to me. How will cars know where to go how to get there? How will they be able to detect when there is a pedestrian trying to cross? Driving should not be made easier for our community because it is a part of everyday life.

Citizens will only become lazier and have no urge or motivation to not only drive but all other natural things. A car that drives it self will only make our country worse no better. It is cool when we see cars driving themselves in movie and on television, but is it really worth it? There are many pros and cons of this particular topic. Prod are there would be a lower rate of deaths and car related injuries because not many people would be driving. As citizens we also have to think about the small percent on people that could possibly be driving. What if a car without a driver had a malfunction and went out of control. I think the result of this situation could be far more dangerous than two drivers colliding.

As a teenager working to get my listens and start driving, cars that drive themselves are not very smart. I think driverless cars is just another way of asking for more conflict and death rates in our country. inbelieve the industry is trying to make electronics too much like humans. They are trying to make these products almost impossible to work, and in the long run lives will be lost. Then th question will be, "What should we do now? This was supposed to work." In my opinion technology is far too advanced now then it should be. I can only imagine what it will be like in five to ten years. I just hope driverless cars will not be in the near future.
