What happen on Mars. In May 24, 2001. One of our spacecraft took many photos of a human face that look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. People think that this is a symbol of life. What they dont know is that we have studied this symbol for a long time and there is no symbol of life on Mars.

NASA sent one our space man Michael Malin to take some pictures with a better camera, revealing that their is no sign of alien life on Mars. "But not everyone was not satified." In April, 1998 we sent another spacecaft to take pictures of Mars but it was to cloudy witch made it look like an alien markings.

April 8, 2001 cloudless day, we sent another one of our viking spacecarft with a better camera so that we could see what we were really into. "Malin team captured an extraordinary photo using maximum resolution."What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa lanforms common around the American West."
