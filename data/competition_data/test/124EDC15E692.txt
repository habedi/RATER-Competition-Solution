Ring! Ring! The bell goes off and its time to go home, but wait the principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. So now you have to stay after school and cant go home until another two hours! I disagree with this decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because kids have chores, homework, some kids dont even like sports, and we might have other plans.

The first reason I disagree with this decision is because some students dont like sports. Students should'nt be forced to do something they dont want to do. Some kids arent good at sports or they just dont like sports, but either way they shouul'nt be forced to play them, its not fair. Also, if students are staying after school to do an extracurricular actvity they wont have any time to do homework or chores. For example if I stay after school for two extra hours, that means im getting home at five o'clock. By five o'clock, I wont have any time to vacuum, do dishes, or homework before its time for dinner.

Lastly, as a student who plays two sports I have a buisy schedule with my practices and If im forced to stay after school for an extracurricular activity it will interfere with my practices. Its not only sports thats this can interfere with, but it could also intefere with plans you have with your family. For example if you want to have dinner with your family at six o'clock you wont be able to because you'll be to buisy working on the yearbook at your school or serving on the student council. Finally, I concluded that the prinicipals decision is not fair and that students should'nt have to do any extracurricular activities!
