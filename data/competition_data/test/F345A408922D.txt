Although some may believe that school projects should be designed by a student it should be known that Teachers should be the project designer. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers have a better chance of making a better and curious project. Not only that but some students dont have the time to work on a project,some have to work, go to sport practice. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers can list all the wed-sites and information you need to complete the project. Students wouldn't have the right tools to be a project designer. Another reason teachers should be the project designer because teachers won't make the project easy. The project is more fun when the teacher make the project more fun and challening. If the teacher as the project designer make the project easy then it won't be hard trying to complete the project. Last for not lease the reason teachers should be the project designer is because the project would be organized. For example the more organized the steps are the more easy it is to complete a project and students designer love rushing when doing things while being destracted and the project is not finished. Some schools require students to complete summer project to assure they continune learning during their break.
