Do you find after school activities important? I think that every student should do at least one extracurricular activity. Because the schools provide activities that deal with sports, technology, and help students decide what career they want to take on. Sports can help you stay healthy and fit, while some of the other activities help you with school.

For Example, if a student tries out for track, but he's a little overweight, but he enjoys the sport so he starts to run and exercise to lose weight. The same can happen with a underweight kid, they could be wrestling and decide to work out to get stronger to win matches. There are so many sports anyone could enjoy at school. They even provide the top 3 sports in the U.S. such as basketball, football, and soccer.

But However, students can get injured and harmed in these sports. They can get teased, bullied, or even picked on if others don't think they're not good enough at the sport. So if the student doesn't enjoy sports they can can do other activities such as coding, yearbook planning, etc. These programs focus more on educational things they don't learn in school. So if a student does coding they can learn to design mods and create things with a computer. The child may want to design a game and become an Game designer because of this.

In Conclusion, the activities provided at school should be participated in by every student. These programs could create a pathway for a students career. They probably want to be a professional sports player or a engineer what ever they think is best for them. Also they can get exercise, knowledge, and even social time. Everyone should do an extracurricular activity.Â
