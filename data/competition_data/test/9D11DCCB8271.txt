Dear principle,

I think you should allow students to use their phones during lunch and other free times as long as we have them off during class time. People have them on during class anyway. If you let students use phones during lunch they will be less tempted to use them during class.

The first reason why you should let students use phones during lunch is that they like you more. If you give people what they want they will like you. Would you rather have people like you or hate you? Well if you want people to like you than let them use their phones at lunch.

The second reason why you should let kids use their phones is that they wont use them in class. If they can use phones at lunch they wont get in trouble for using them in class. The parents wont hate if their kids don't get in trouble.

That is why you should allow kids to use their phones at lunch. If you don't let them then shame on you.
