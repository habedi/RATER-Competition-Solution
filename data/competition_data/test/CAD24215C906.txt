"School activities can help a student grow, learn, and be taught more about adulthood." said Generic_Name. My principal has made a policy where a student must take at least one extracurricular activity. The school gives lots of choices like sports, student council, and you can also work on the yearbook. You can find many more of the activities through your school website. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular class throughout the year.

These activities the school has for you to participate in could help make you friends. You could make friends by joining the soccer team and connecting with new people. Making friends could help stop bullying or lower the chance of it for you and your friends. Making friends could increase the grades of yours since you have a friend to help you when in need. Extracurricular classes could start some really great friendships during the school year.

One other important thing a school activity could help with is finding a job. Kids don't usually know what they wanna be when they enter high school or even college, so maybe these activities could help young kids get an idea of what they like to do. Helping kids find out what they like to do could really help the kid see what he or she would like to be in the future. This could also help kids get used to what they wanna do, and then when they enter college, they will already know what they want to try. Extracurricular classes or activities will increase the percent of how many kids know what they want to do when they grow up.

Extracurricular activities could help make school and life more fun. Fun is something a child or kid needs in their life, and elementary school through middle school should be fun times. These activities like sports and other things could really help you have fun in school or out of school. Playing a sport you love can help make friends and show you what your interests are, which makes life more fun. I have also had an experience of playing a sport for the school during my middle school days. It was very fun making relationships with others and I decided soccer was what I wanted to do in college.

My principal made a policy that says all students must take an extracurricular activity and I agree with this policy. Outside school activities or in school activities or anything like that could help in so many ways to a persons life. Helping find a job, having fun, and making friends could all help with the future and the present. These activities aren't just something to skip out on, they are something to try. Trying something new could change someones life and could help with decisions through adulthood.Â
