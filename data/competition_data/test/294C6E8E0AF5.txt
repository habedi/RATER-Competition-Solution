We as people want to explore to new levels that no one has ever been to. Some of those things could be going to Venus. You would be the first person to go, everyone would love you, and you would get so much fame. Here's some things that you don't know about. It's exreamly dangerous and your chances of survival and very slim. By slim I mean next to none.

The planet is 97% carbon dixoide so we wouldn't be able to breath and you have have to be in a space suit with limited oxygen supply. Next, you wouldn't be able to touch the surface considering that the average temperatures and 800 degress fahrenheit. When you're there you won't be able to collect materails such as rocks, gases, or even anything else because you won't be able to get to there surface and anything you use to try to touch the surface will melt.

When you are there you will be experiencing 90 times more atompheric pressure than you would here on earth. It would literally crush you to be present on the surface of Venus. Not to mention you could be the second fatherist away from earth and that'll make it longer to get back to earth than normal. Also, when you are there the planet is rotating faster than it would on earth and make you very sick.

So, before you decide to make big leaps and explore new places you got to know what you can and can't do. The author from the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" gave me my information and did an amazing job explaining and getting me to understand how harse Venus could really be. You are limited to far heights and it's your choice to find them.
