The challenges of exploring of Venus can be the differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. It might challenge you in the that that you dn't have anything to help you get ther like astronoits. It can challenge you when you near the sun or when you trying to get to it, sometimes the sun can catch up on us. On the plnet's surface, temperatures verage over 800% Degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure id 90 times greater than what we experiene on our own planet.

The other scoholsr college don't be like where we at right now. Like some people or every human being can't breath on another planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temeperature of any planet in our solar system. Even though Mercury is closer to our sun. BEyond the high pressuure and heat, Venusian geologyand weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquick, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land and on its surface.

There's a lot of things that can challenge you from exploring to the Venus. You need something that you can fly with or even the things that are saty for ever like your astronoit should be full or have somehting that still can turn it on and the things that I don't know.........
