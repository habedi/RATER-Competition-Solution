Do you feel tired, over stressed, and ready to be doing things on your own time after school? After a long school day, many of us students want to be able to relax, spend time with our family and friends, and get done whatever work we have been assigned over with. Many students also have certain hobbies they enjoy to do after school, such as being apart of a sports team or something else. Some students may enjoy staying after school or doing extracurricular activities daily, but some other students may choose not to do that and do not enjoy doing that. Every student should be able to choose how they would like to spend their time, this is why the principles new policy that you must do an extracurricular activity should be banished. Students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity because, they should not feel forced to do something that may not interest them, they have other after school priorities they need to get done, and they need a break and time to do things that are not related to school.

First off, one main reason the "you have to do an extracurricular activity" rule should be banned is because this is forcing students to do something against their own will. Personally, I do not like having to stay after school. After school hours should be the students choice in how they use them. Pressuring students into choosing an activity that have to do multiple times a week is unfair because the school may not offer anything they find interest in. A lot of students may have a busy schedule outside of school and do not have the time for any extracurricular activities due to being committed to something else. Our principle should really consider that extracurricular activities are a students choice and are not mandatory.

Next, another reason that this extracurricular activity rule should be banned is, after school students have certain priorities they need to get done. Most teachers tend to assign their students with homework that is due the next class. Students being able to have the time to get their homework done is something that is extremely important. Students also have things that they may need to study for when they get home from school. Studying is also very important and you need a lot of time, patience, as well as the ability to focus when studying. All that most students want is to be successful in school. Studying and putting lots of time and effort into your work is one of the big keys to success. Therefore, if a student is being forced into doing an activity they do not enjoy it ruins their ability to focus, and giving them less time to themselves because now they have another priority to do after school.

Lastly, the final reason the extracurricular activity rule should not exist is students need a life and things to do that are outside of school. Think about it, students are stuck in school for 7 hours five times a week. That ends up being a lot of their time spent doing things they all may not be interested in at all. Students should have some of their time spent in different locations and not constantly always at the same place. It is just like being stuck in your home for multiple days, you run out of things to do and then get easily bored, this exact same thing can always happen with staying at school too much. After school hours are the times students can go wherever they please and that should not have to change for anyone.

Finally, making extracurricular activities mandatory is unfair to the students because this is forcing them to do something they may not truly like and taking away more hours out of their free time. Some students might love extracurricular activities and getting involved, while others may like to do things that have nothing to do with school at all. I think it is very important to respect the students and let them make the decision for themselves. Students may already be doing an activity after school but they are just not school related or occur at the school they attend. Our principle needs to understand all the possibilities of why students may not do an extracurricular activity or may not want to do one. This policy is something that should not exist because the freedom of the students matters more than anything.
