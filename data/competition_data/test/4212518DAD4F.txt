In recent years, many schools have begun to offer programs for online learning through video lectures and online assignments.

Many colleges provide this as an option for students enrolled at their schools.

Although it hasn't been as widespread among elementary, middle, and high schools, school boards have started to discuss this option due to the coronavirus outbreak.

This option allows teachers to continue instruction while not having direct contact with the students and hopefully limiting the spread of the virus.

This method also reduces the security risk of schools where there is the possibility of a fire, natural disaster, or active shooter.

In some cases, this method of learning can be beneficial for students, but overall distance learning is not an appropriate substitute for in class learning.

One reason that distance learning isn't as effective is the lack of control that it offers.

In online courses, many students are able to cheat on tests, quizzes, and other assignments.

Without a teacher their to monitor them, there is no way to verify that students are acting honorably.

This can lead to problems, especially if students make a habit of recieving unauthorized aid on assignments.

When students make that a habit, they do not always learn the skills that the assignment is testing them on.

Additionally, it instills a belief that they do not have to work hard to do their work.

Without a better way to monitor cheating, distance learning can not be as effective as in class learning.

Another issue with distance learning is the inability to do hands on assignments.

Many courses such as Physical Education, Chemistry, Biology, and other science courses require hands on assignments like labs.

Distance learning eliminates the ability of students to complete these assignments that are key elements of these courses.

Even with courses that do not require such assignments, some students learn and retain knowledge better when they have hands on assignments.

Without hands on learning, these students may not achieve the same level of understanding that they would through in class learning.

Distance learning limits the ability of students and teachers to perform hands on assignments which can be deterimental to certain courses and students.

Distance learning can also be expensive as it requires students to have a computer or electronic device and a stable internet connection.

This is not a problem for many students, but for some this is very difficult.

This system puts poorer students who may not have the best technology at a disadvantage.

In order to avoid this inequality, schools would have to find a way to ensure that all students would recieve the same educational experience.

This would mean spending even more money to provide students with internet and electronic devices, as well as any additional materials that they might need.

Distance learning could be helpful as a short-term alternative if students are unable to come to school because of something like sickness or snow.

This system would allow them to continue learning even if they are unable to be physically present at school.

While this option is appealing, it would not work well as a long-term system because of it could cause inequality among students of different financial situations, it lacks oversight that could prevent cheating, and it can cause students to lose certain educational opportunities that can be crucial to their understanding of certain topics.
