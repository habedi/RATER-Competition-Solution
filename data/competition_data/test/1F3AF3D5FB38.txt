Even though a lot of school aged kids participate in after school activities, there are still a lot who don't. Some of them don't participate because theres nothing they like. There are also some kids that act like since they arent forced to do the activities then they won't ever do them, which may set them back in life. Most activities can be so fun, exciting, and interesting. In addition, there are a lot of benefits to participating in such activities, they keep you active and healthy, makes interact with others, and they can keep you busy. So if the principal was to make kids participate in one after school activity that would be a great and wonderful idea.

People who commit to an activity of some sort can stay active and have a healthier mindset compared to a person who doesnt participate. For example, if you sign up for volleyball club after school after the principal made the announcement that you have too. You now not only have a way to exercise but also an activity to help take your mind off everything else. Even if you sign up for a learning club or activity, like a "teaching you how to eat healthy club", can impact your life. But you can get healthier after participating in a club or activity. If your going through a rough time then for some people a good thing would for you to do something other than mope around about it. You can develop good sportsmanship and other great qualities of a person. In other words many good influences can come off of having to do an activity.

Interaction with other people is almost a given when participating in any sort of activity. Human interaction is a huge part of everything in our world. But so many people today have a hard time with it for many different reasons. So if you start at a younger age, trying to get better to interact with people, you'll get set for the rest of your life. As you interact and talk to people you learn a lot. You develop a sense of great team work and friendship. So many friendships are started when you start talking to people at these actives. You'll feel not alone and a great friend can rub off some good traits, making you a better person. In conclusion, interaction is great to do and going to these activities will help you interact with people.

Activities make you stay busy, and take up your time in a good way. People who don't participate in activities will get bored easily and often. While someone who does participate in one will have a lot more to do. For example, if you participate in a spring lacrosse league and on a random Sunday you get bored you can practice lacrosse in your backyard. Another example might be if you participate in boy scouts or girl scouts you may have homework to do before your next meeting. But all a person has that doesn't participate in any activities is sitting on their bed or a couch on their phones. Then every hour theyll think to themselves how bored they are. Participating in activities gets you busy and not as bored as often.

Making kids participate in any activity, or sport is a great idea. Why? Well because great benefits come from participating in activities like keeping you active, interacting with others, and keeping you busy. Whatever you do whether its a club, sport, or just a plain activity of some sort, many opportunities can show up for you. A new passion developed can introduce a job oppritunity or hobby. Doing activities is a wonderful experience that you have to do yourself. Even if you might not completely like what youre doing at first. Who knows maybe you'll find your new passion and hobby.
