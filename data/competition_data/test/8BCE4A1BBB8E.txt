Dear Principal,

I think the policy change is not good. There are a lot of kids that don't have a grade B average. If half of the kids have a grade C average then half of the kids won't be able to participate in sports. The parents will be mad and probably sue the school for the policy change. Some kids may not be great in a particular subject like math or science. Some kids may be great at basketball or volleyball and could be a great player in the team. Most sport scholarships are given to kids because of their efforts on the team. You could be crushing a kid's dream of becoming the next basket ball star from changing the policy. A lot of students work their very best to get the grades they got and so them may be weak in a subject. That kid that is sitting in that desk could be a great athlete but he couldn't since he/she made a grade C average. Students should be allow to participate in sports if he/she has a grade C,B, or A

average. Another thing is that lots of kids will probably became fat from not doing any sports or not find their talent in another activity. A person may not know if he/she is great at computer graphics or carpentry. There are lots of jobs in the future that a student could take but he/she probably wouldn't take that job because he/she wasn't able to participate in that particular activity.

This policy change could ruin lots of future dreams for kids. I hope this changes your mind on changing the policy.
