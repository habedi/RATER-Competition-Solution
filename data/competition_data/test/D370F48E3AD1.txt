To the principal,

I don't think that you should make the kids have at least a B grade average.

The reason that I don't think they should is because if you start out the nine weeks with a bad grade, then you cant play for a good while until you get it up the whole way to a B. It's just not fair. Now, I know that kids should have good grades, but you can't expect that everybody that plays sports is going to have a B average. There not all the same.

Especially, since I read that in your school, many students have a grade C average. In our school, if you have 1 F you are still allowed to play, just as long as you get that up in a week. So principal please consider that not all kids have the same learning ability, so keep it at a something that most kids can achieve, like at a C average.

Thank you.
