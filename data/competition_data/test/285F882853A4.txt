Dear Principal,

The policy you should choose is number 1, i think its the best. Every kid or teen that go to school needs to bring there phone. Here are some reasons what if some kids were stuck outside in the rain and they got sick because you wouldn't let them bring there phone. Im not saying its your fault, but there parents might be ticked off at you. Another reason is , what if there was a kid about to get in a fight and they didn't want to. If they had there phones the kid could of called is mom or dad whoever to pick him or her up and it would of been over. No you didn't allow them to bring their phones so know that kid is walking home with two black eyes, and one bloody nose, because you wouldn't allow them to bring there phones. How do you think he's going to explain that to there mom or dad. " Yea mom i was walking home from school and i ran into a pole." T

I also like policy 2, but not more than 1. The reason why is students always text during class when there not suppose to. If there texting in class that can lead them to not knowing the information. Another reason is threats and fights, we all know that stuff is dangerous and you can prevent it more, by not letting students bring there phone to school.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
