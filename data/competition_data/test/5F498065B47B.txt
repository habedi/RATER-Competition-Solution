Dear Principal:

I would consider Policy 1 being a commendable option too the students and teachers.

There can be emergencies and family health issues a student would need be notified of during school time. I'm sure this would be good and there would be no problems. Students need cell phones by their side in case something happens in school and they need get in touch with a parent or relative. Also, there can be a bus situation when you need your cell phone in the process. Cell phones shouldn't be a big deal. Teachers use their cell phones when they want , and when they need make important calls. Therefore, students using theirs shouldn't be a problem. They need it as much as the teacher do. Policy 2, well not a very good choice. If you was too set this rule and say students couldn't bring their cell phones to school , more than likely some students would bring them anyway. For example: you can't bring your cell phone to school and something bad happens, and you need get in touch with your parent as soon as possible. What can you do? Nothing at all , but wait around for a teacher or an adult too get in touch with the parent. Not smart at all, considering that your life is in danger. Principal, think about the consequences and the trouble it can cause, by not allowing students too bring they phones at school. It's not effecting the school nor the people in it. My opinion is to go for Policy 1. You won't have too worry about taking phones away because they not allowed or fussing with a student because they refuse. As long as the students don't use their cell phones in class, then it shouldn't be a problem. Think about it and see which is best, I gave you my opinion. Now it's all up too you and what you consider best for your students.

Sincerely,
