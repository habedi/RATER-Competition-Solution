Sports and activities. At this point in our lives, who doesn't really do one? Doing things like these keep our minds, and our body's active. It helps keeps us stay focused on our weight, grades, and the way we act. If our principle wanted to move the grade average to a B to play sports, I think that there would be a lot of chaos. Our schools practically revolve around our work, our sports, and our other activities. We are all on the same team no matter who you root for, it's still what we enjoy doing.

If you had to have the grade average of a B to play in any activities, i don't know what would happen. Maybe it could help people bring their grades up, or maybe it wouldn't. You never know til you try something, so it's always hard just to guess. I would go against the grade average being moved up, because I don't think it would really help. Sports or activities are always your choice, whether you want to play or not. Whether you should shoot, kick, jump, tackle, or just close your eyes. It's your choice, and no one else can change that for you.

I also think that if they moved it up, many people would just stop playing. If you don't understand a school subject, and yet you can still pass I think that it's okay. I mean, yes you would want to be able to understand things a whole lot better, but if they're not going to help you in the future what's the point? Getting good grades is a fantastic thing, but if you really want something it all comes down to you. It's your choice to follow your heart and do what you want to do, or to do what's best for you.

Whether you're for, or against something it's still your choice to do what you want. Making choices can be tough, but you can always try to find something out. That's why I would be against moving the grade average up to a B. I believe that it could be a good thing, or a bad thing but you'll never know til you try. Those are my reasons to be against it, but no matter what it's still passing. In the end, it will always come down to your choice, and what's best for you.
