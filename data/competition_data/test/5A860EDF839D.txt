I think it would be a great idea to have this kind of technology in the classroom. There are many reasons why it can be seen as valuable. For example, students would stay on task longer and may even look forward to lessons. Who knows, maybe it could even change their outlook on school.

If we had this kind of technology, students would be able to work so much more efficiently. There are so many times when I see other students around me struggling with different kinds of activities and lessons. Not every student is the same, so you can't expect all students to score perfect on the same assignments. In paragraph six, Dr. Haung states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This point could also help teachers connect and understand with each individual student better.

I wish we had this kind of technology at my school. I feel like if we did, I'd be able to understand many more of the concepts my teahcers are teaching. Using the Facial Action Coding System could be extremely beneficial to schools around the world.
