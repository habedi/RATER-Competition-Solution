Missing out or being absent to a class can affect a student immensely. It could cause their grade to go down because he or she was absent. Many students are marked absent daily not because they are skipping school, but because they might be sick or even outside of the country for certain purposes. They could miss out on important learning material in a certain class. Some schools are starting to help out students by offering them a

Distance Learning program. This program allows students to attend classes from home through video conferences, or online. Many might say that with this program, students will become lazy and not attend school leading to a decline in student attendance. If you put it in a student's perspective, it will help them. Offering students an option to attend school from home through video conference is beneficial for them because now they will be caught up with the rest of the class, students can now stop worrying about missing work, and it will help students with illnesses or injuries that don't allow them to attend school.

Knowing the material that they are a teaching you in a class is very important. It can help you get a good score on the unit test, and on the final exam. This program can help those students who can't make it to school to catch up on the material that they have missed. The student can attend through a video conference or can find the material on the class page online. If a student still needs help, the teacher can then help the student when he or she next attends school. Students will now feel more confident and assured when it comes to a pop quiz, or the unit test.

When a student misses a class, they have missing work to complete. If students have the option to have a video conference at home to attend class, they can stop worrying about missing work. Many students have stress about missing work, and it is not healthy. Some might not even turn in the work because they feel discouraged to do it because they don't know how to.

With this program students will feel encouraged to at least try a problem on the worksheet. They will also know when to turn it in if it's a project. With that being said, students will feel more comfortable about missing work because they have the program to help them.

Another reason why this program is helpful is because it helps students who have an illness or an injury that forbids them to attend school. Some students do a sport after school and can suffer an injury. It could be a broken leg or a dislocated hip and that can make them be absent. With the program, the student can attend school from home and have the material that they are teaching on campus. It also helps students that are sick, they could have a severe illness that does not allow them to go to school. The

Distance Learning program will help them learn the material as well.

The

Distance Learning program helps out a lot of students because they are at the same pace as the rest of the class, they can feel less worried about missing work, and it will help students with illnesses or injuries that don't allow them to attend school. For students it is important to know what you are being taught because then you can ace your final exams. Being absent can affect your grades but with the help of the

Distance Learning program, you will be able to succeed in your academic career.
