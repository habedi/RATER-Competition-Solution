If my principal was to make a plan about this with the students in school it will be a good idea for we can teach elementary students and other clean up litter. Tutoring elementary would be great for there school. because the students will learn more about there school subject and cleaning litter would be good for the environment and it would give us a good opportunity to show others that its good to clean up litter around where you live and also other places because we would have to care about how clean it is around us and also how we live because anyone wouldn't want the world to be a dump so performing community service would be very important but others would like the idea, so they would mind cleaning up garbage around them so the kids that would mind cleaning up litter around them can teach elementary kids so they can have a good opportunity to help the kids and also make the school a little better learning, also the kids that wouldn't mind cleaning up litter can do community service so my letter to the principal would be let the kids that wouldn't want to do community service to tutor the elementary kids for the elementary kids can do better and the people that would want to do community service can do that job for they can make the world a living peace and show other people that cleaning up litter can be good around your neighborhood and also a better environment a better place for others and know that the principal put up with a great idea, tutoring elementary kids and also doing community service which have would be a good idea. So I think the position I would be in is doing community service because i would like public areas to be litter free and also the people that would live around there would know what a great job I have done and they would appreciate the thing i have done. So the people that would live around there would know that i have been helpful to the community they live in.
