Dear Principle,

Recently you have been wondering whether or not to require students to perform community service acts. I disagree with this choice because some students already have things planned to do, such as practice for a sport they play or have dance recitals, want to hang out with friends, or just simply don't want to do it.

Lets face it, many students have practice after school or on weekends for sports, dance, choir, and lots of other things, and this is very time consuming. The students would find it very hard to put community service acts in when they already have homework, practice, and family dinners to attend to. Also many people our age want to go places with friends.

Students usually plan to hang out with their friends right after school or on the weekends. Therefore, the community service acts would get in the way. Sure they could go do it together, but most students out age want to go to the mall, go watch a movie, play outside, not work on stuff they don't want to do. Another reason I disagree with this is choice is many students just don't want to do it even if they aren't busy.

Okay, where all lazy from time to time, you might disagree but its true. If students were required to do community service acts, many would not do it, getting their parents to lie for them saying they did do it. Also we have other things to do such as reading, play games, go shopping, hang out with out boyfriend/ girlfriend, being a couch potato, or just sleeping. Requiring us to do this would be plainly pointless if students weren't even going to do it.

As you have seen, I fully disagree with community service acts because students have practices and recitals to attend, are busy with their friends, or just don't want to do it. I hope you can take my letter in consideration when you make your choice.

Sincerely,
