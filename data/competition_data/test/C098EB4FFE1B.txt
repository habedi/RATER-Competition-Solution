Dear Principal,

You should let us have are phones. Cause were just going to use them any way! it would help us to we could stay in school and not drop out or skip if we could have are phones! and i think its a good idea to let us have them I mean why should the teachers be able to have them out?! Its not fair! it would also make are work easier to I mean it would be easier to consintrate. And if people had phones that means we would stay out of trouble. We get in fights and act out cause were bored and stuff. With are phones we wont be bored i mean we have something to do. The less fights we have and stuff is better right? i just don't see the point in that at all i mean not being able to have a phone out. cause the people who you whana talk to are in ether a diff room and if there in a diff room then there going to go to that and get the person they whana talk to so you see my point? i would have to say just let us have are phones!!!
