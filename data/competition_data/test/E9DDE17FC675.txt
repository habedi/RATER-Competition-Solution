Have you ever been on an overseas trip?

Joining the Seagoings Cowboys program will fullfil your endeavor if this interests you! This wonderful experience will change your life! You will help tend the animals that will be shipped overseas and you will get to see interesting parts of Europe! You will also get have fun on the way home because all the animals were shipped to their destination! You will help the UNRRA help recover food supplies to countries ruined by World War Two. I promise you will want to go!

Helping tend to the animals really kept me busy but it was worth helping others after World War Two. If you become a night watchman you check up on the animals every hour. You may also have to feed and water them two or three times a day. Bales of hay and oats would have to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship. Last but not least you may have to clean the stalls. I experienced each one of these jobs including being a watchman. If you do not like to work, doing this job may not be right up your alley.

You also get to see cool and interesting places like Venice, Italy. Since the streets there are water, I got to take a gondola ride! I also went to Greece and saw the Acropolis. That was a special experience for me as well. Another activity you might see is going to an excavated castle in Crete on the way to China. One last thing I saw was the Panama Canal also on my way to China.

Another thing I experienced that you might to if you join is finding times to have fun on the ship, especially on the way back. The stalls were turned into courts for boisterious games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, and boxing. A more calm and layed back activity we did was reading and other games to pass the time.

I hope you consider joining the amazing experience of being a Seagoing Cowboy due to helping people, seeing new places, and having a good time while doing it! Participating in this program will change your life!
