Why might someone choose to be a seagoing cowboy? I became a seagoing cowboy because it was the opportunity of a lifetime. Not only was it a great adventure,but I also did it for the exploration and to help people in need. These things made it worth the dangers at sea.

First, I knew the adventure the trips held would be great like when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I got to meet new people in the places we traveled to. I even learned of some new cultures. Every trip had something different or new about it. Also,on each journey the other volunteers I traveled with became some of my closest friends.

Next, I became a seagoing cowboy for the exploration. I experienced so many new places for example there's the excavated caslte in Crete or the Panama Canal on my way to China. On some nights the ocean seemed to be a black endless void, but on clear days it looked like a beautiful blue mass. I also saw great foriegn marvels that I never imagined being able to see in person.

Finally, I joined the program to help people. Not only was I taking care of the animals that would bring livestock back to the nations, but I was supplying them with food. The people were always grateful to see us arrive with what was going to help rebuild their home country and their nation. We were repairing war-torn countries.

Each and every reason including, adventure, exploration, and helping people in need, are why I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. Although, I never would have thought about it if my friend Don, hadn't asked me to come to Europe with him on a cattle boat. He played a big part in changing my life forever. However, I wasn't always a natural at the job, it took practice. Tell me, who would you ask to come on such an adventure with you?
