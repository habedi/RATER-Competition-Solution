Dear, principal

I feel that you're new policy is wrong and immoral. It is unfair to the students and staff. the students grade's at our school is an average c not a b. If u raise the bar you will not have enough people to make a full team; and you will not be able to pay the staff for coaching know one if he/she has no players.

Secondly when the grade is set at c stundents are striving to get higher than a c so they don't have to worry about being ineligible. However if the set grade is a b than they feel it is too hard to achieve and they will no longer try to reach that goal anymore.

Last sports are a great outlet for kids who are at the age were they will get tempted to do bad things or pushed into trying things that are illegal. If a student play sports for 2 hours after school that is 2 hours he/she could've been getting in trouble. But they are not aren't now. That is my argument.

your student, STUDENT_NAME
