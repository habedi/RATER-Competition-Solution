Polution not only for our well beings, but to think that if we contribute to the matter that is at stake than the overall wellness of our world will change not only for us but for our children. And therefore laws should be allowed to be in certain parts of the U.S, and there should be some sort of back up from the citizens aswell to what President Obama believes.

Like mentioned in Source 1 last scentence in paragraph 7 "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"; and this alone is why we should worry for our atmosphere. I mean think about it 50% is a huge amount and to think that it could be grealty decreased by certain laws that ban cars at certain times.

Again i find it amazing that our government has the thought of polution in their minds and plans for example "President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gsas emissions. And studies show that fewer Americans are buying cars and getting fewer licences aswell which is beficial to the enviroment and overall wellness of the world.

To conclude Polution should be something to keep in mind therefore laws should be allowed to be in certain parts of the U.S, and there should be some sort of back up from the citizens aswell to what President Obama believes.       Â
