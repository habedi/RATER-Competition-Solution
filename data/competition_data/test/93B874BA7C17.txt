Here is what ive learned from this passage Earth venus and mars are are planetary neighbors. they use spacecrafts to land on venus for clues and what the planet venus is all about. and Scientist havent got any really good and frequent data,and thats because the spacecrafts break for more than a few hours. i really interesting fact is, a spaceship hasnt land on venus for more than 3 decades. Venus is a challenging and a hard planet to learn from because it nhas so many things that messes up our data. On Venus, the reason why we couldent land there and our machines break all the time is that the the temperature on the surface of venus averages around 800 degrees. these conditions are extreamly dangerous. no one ever encountered that on our planet earth long ago ago they believed that venus did have water on its planet and could have been wild life there. studying venus is really cool in my opinion and the dangers of it. one day we will find a solution and be able to land on venus and explore and learn even more about it
