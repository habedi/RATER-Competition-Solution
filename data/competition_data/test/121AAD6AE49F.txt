In my opinion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because it is not easy to attend classes for every students.

First reason is I have seen students who used while chairs and crutches in school. It is hard for them to go to their classes because they can not move their legs. So they would be late to class. It would be a stress for them. Also, there are many students in the school. Their injures could get worse when they fall down due to collides with other students when they walk in the hallway. The worse thing is when there is a fire in school. It is difficult for them to move quickly from class room to outside. It is not safe for them.

Another reason why students has benefit from being able to attend classes is in my experience once, my brother Generic_Name moved to Japan in order to go to college in there when he was senior. However, most of public high schools did not accept him because it was too late to transfer and hard to catch up study with classmates. So he decided to transfer to international high school. Now, he is attending to international high school in Tokyo. However, he is living in Osaka. It takes time directly to go to his school everyday and it costs a lots of money as well. So his teacher gave him a permission to attend his classes on computer from his house. When he used to attend in high school in USA, he had many homework everyday, and did not have enough sleep. So he was always sleeping in class. Compare to now, he can study whenever he wants and he has time to get enough time to sleep. It also reduce hard works and stress. Also he created his schedule by himself. So he can manage his time.

In conclusion, it is not easy to attend classes for students who got injures or students who are attending to school that is long distance from house. Also it would reduce their stress, can be safe, and manage their time. This is the reason why I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.
