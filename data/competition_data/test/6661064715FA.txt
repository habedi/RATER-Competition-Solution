To : TEACHER_NAME

Every day students like to play Basket ball ,soccer ,base ball, an so on .I attend middle school an young teens enjoy to participate in sports.

Changing the policy to no sports or activities unless a grade point B average is not a good a idea. Not all student are that great of a teens are that great, some do have hard times in work.

One main reason is that student don't always have the best grades . Not all students like a subject or who knows some teachers teach differently .i know because i PROPER_NAME have gone through this .An let me tell you it is really hard to keep those wannabe be straight B' s .

If you TEACHER_NAME change school policy ,these students may aurally drop those grades .Im ean have you thought of students they need some freedom ,fun ,cause not all of them come to school just for just .Some like fun because there parents don't give that freedom you guys could do . you guys could be that second parent that gives them some time.

Step in our shoes a least for once ,its different now a days we like fun like sports an activities ,to be a good student.
