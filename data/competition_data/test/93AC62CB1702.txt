Dear principal,

Some of my friends are taking some of their time out of the day to perform community service. I understand that you are thinking about making community service a requirement for all students. I do not think that you should do this. Making community service a must for students could make students mad. Community service also takes time out when we are doing homework and studying for tests and quizzes that are very important and count heavily toward our grade.

I feel that forcing kids to do community service would make students unhappy and not put as much energy towards that service that they are doing.

On the other hand, community service could make students better people. Community service could also take students away from they` re treasured video games such as Call of Duty and Halo. Getting students away from these games could make them less violent and overall better people. Also, doing community service could get them out of their tight group of friends and be more in touch with the outside world. It could make them understand the point of charities and maybe the students could help the charities out on their free time.

Over all, i think that you should not make community service a requirement for all students. In stead, you could just make community service an extra-credit assignment or something like that.
