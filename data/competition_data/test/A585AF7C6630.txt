Dear Principle,

I have heard you are dealing with some issues concerning cell phone policies. I personally have seen how much time teenagers spend on their cell phones. I, being an intelligent young teenager, do not have a phone and do not want one until I drive for safety issues. When my friends and I are talking they are always on their phones texting and I am left there to do nothing but stare at the wall which makes me mad but also forms my opinion. My opinion on the matter is that teenagers can bring their phones to school and immediately turn them off during school hours. I would not allow them to use their phones during lunch periods or free time. You might think I'm being cruel but think, if kids use them during free periods they can get on the internet and look up answers and anything else the internet has to offer, which is not always good stuff. Now once free period or lunch is over most kids will forget to turn them off and you will have ring tones going off which not only interrupts the class but also the students.

Also, teenagers tend to get jealous over which phone other teens have. They say I don't have just a phone, I have The Evo 4G which will lead to disagreement over phones. What will happen when some people have phones and then they make fun of the people who don't, allowing phones will just add to bullying in your school. I also think that the young adults will steal each other's phones because of how nice they are, leading to argument and hate. The students will probably even look to you to see what has happened to your phone and what could you do about it, nothing. I think phones at school during hours is a bad idea because they are on their phones 24/7, so allowing them to use them during school just adds to that amount of media they have in their lives. With phones getting advancing so quickly, I think you should ban phones during school hours. This is my opinion on the matter. Thank you for your time.
