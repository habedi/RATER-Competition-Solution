A new program, the Facial Action Coding System, regonizes facial emotions. It can show the different emotions on a person's face by the different muscles they're using. Prof. Thomas Huang's facial recognition technology is valuable for a classroom. It would show whether or not a student is enjoying the lesson and adjust lessons to the liking of the student.

First, the program could understand humans better to fit our needs. The article says, ""Most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang. "So computers need to understand that, too."" This is telling how computers need to better understand how humans work, as in the different ways we convey emotions and thought. It also needs to know the different varients of human emotion. The article states, "By weighing the diffferent units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. each expression is compared against a neutral face." This explains how the program wouldn't show a regular "happy" emotion and compare a human's to it, but instead start with no emotion and see which muscles are used to find the emotion. For example, the article states, "She's 83 precent happy, 9 percent disgust, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." That's the emotion of da Vinici's painting, "Mona Lisa". The software states exaclty what her emotions are, not just one emotion.

Then, the program could act like a teacher and fix lessons to better the student. The article says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modifty the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that Dr. Huang believes that his technology could, in the future, rearrange lessons and work them for the student better when working on computers. The article then states, "For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." The technology would personalize the computer to fit the user better, making it beneficial for a student.

The software helps identify different emotions in humans, including the "Mona Lisa". It can show different varieties of human emotions and then find if someone is enjoying what they're seeing online. This helps students by the program recognizing how they're feeling about lessons, then adjusting them to fit their needs. The program would really make a big difference for online teaching.
