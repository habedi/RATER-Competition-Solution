The argument of the face on Mars, which I am here to discuss. I will be discussing these key things: What the face is and Why NASA wouldn't want to keep life in space a secrect.

The "face" is a rock mond. The shadows caused by the sun make the illusion of human features. The "face" is similar to some locations on Eath as stated by the cheif scientist. The "face" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa.

NASA is a program that would like more funding than already grated. If there is a major space break through NASA, would be grated a funding boost. NASA would not hide the sign of life from the public's eyes. NASA, most likely, would want to promote life in space.

Now in conclusion, the "face' is a rock mond and NASA would not life to hide alien life. Now that I have covered the topic what is your view on the face on Mars?
