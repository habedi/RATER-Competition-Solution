Dear principal,

I don't like this idea at all. I have never gotten below a B average, but I know a lot of students that are below it, and a lot of those student are athlete's. If you were to change this then we would have maybe eight people on a team. So we would eventually not have sports at all because you need more then eight people to complete a team. I understand that sports are a privilege, and we need good grades in order to have this privilege, but some people only have sports to look forward to because of their grades. I think that it should be a C average.

I love sports, I play softball, basketball, and volleyball. Without those sports I would be bored, and probably not as successful. If I had a C and was not eligible to play sports I would be miserable. Sports are my life and I know they are other peoples too. I have a friend who doesn't do the best in school, but when sports come around she makes sure she tries her hardest so she can play. She usually is a C student, but she is an excellent athlete. She is one of the best athlete's I know. Without the students that get below a B, our team would not only be small, but it also wouldn't be very good.

I hope that you can see, that without the students that make a C average, we would eventually have no team, and then no sports at all. We would loose all our privileges due to grades. I think that we should be allowed a C average at least. So then we could have the amount of players necessary and have a good team. I play to win. I know we cant always win, but I want to at least try to. You may think that this is to punish only those who have a C average, but if you do this than you are punishing everyone.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
