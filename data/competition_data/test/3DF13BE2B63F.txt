As of right now, imagining an automobile-free world may sound crazy, but amibitous goals to end the use of cars has taken place. Suburban and city residents have taken quite a lot of thought into banning driving and giving up their cars, because of the great advantages that go along with these limitations. Reducing the use of cars has amazing advantages in creating a non-polluted environment, it leads to an increase in exercise, and provides a way to save one's money.

Car reduced communities are being promoted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, aswell as all around the world. Paris, France has enforced a driving ban to reduce the intensifying pollution all over the city, as explained in the article entitled, "Paris bans driving due to smog". If the pattern of banning the use of cars persists, the amount of pollution will be reduced, especially in major big cities, such as Paris, London and Beijing. Continuing this cultural shift "will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment" ("The End of Car Culture"). Limiting the use of cars would highly advantage and could possibly save our environment, if we conserve our resources correctly.

Hiking, biking, skating and/or walking are all types of physical activities that are useful to get from point A to B, rather than using a car. People have began to organize their lives around how they can get to places by exercising, than commuting by car. Restaurants, shopping malls, and work offices are beginning to be located in highly populated areas and within walking range, so that the use of automobiles becomes unecessary. In Bogota, Columbia, people take a car-free day to promote alternative forms of transporation and reduce smog. Bogota "has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths" ("Car-free day is spnning into a big hit in Bogota"), in order to encourage citizens to get off the roads with their cars. Exercising has many advantages in limiting car usage, not only creating a non-polluted planet, but also creating a healthier lifestlye for a person.

As gasoline prices rise, and car insurance rates fly up, less and less people are getting a license and have stopped buying cars to save money. A study done between the years 2001 and 2009 found that driving by young people decreased by twenty-three percent, explained in the article, "The End of Car Culture". Leasing or owning a car is not a priority for many, as the use of taking public transportation or car-pooling is available. Without cars, people are able to save money for important life necessecities, such as food, water, and shelter, where as a car is not something needed and may be considered a luxury in other parts of the world.

Commuting is not imposibble without owning a car. With forms of exercise and public transportation, many are able to get around without spending hundreds of dollars per week on gasoline. Less driving creates a non-polluted and healthier environment, keeping our planet more stable. Eventhough owning a car seems convenient now, it may not be so convenient in the long run, as we may have to face difficulties that life throws at us. Wasting money on a car gives no advantages, where as a car-free environment is safer and more effective.       Â
