My opinion, driverless cars are a good idea. There are less accidents using the driverless cars. The car will alert you reguardless if you're paying attention or not. It will vibrate your seat. Drivers are either on their phones, messing with the radio, or talking to the passengers. That's not a good thing. It will be if you have a driverless car, because like I said, you will be alerted. You won't be able to speed or get mad and frusterated because the other drivers or not going the speed limit. I know a lot of people that like to drive being on their phone or something. When they do that, they start to run off the street or onto the other lane. You don't want to panic when that happens. When you panic, you wreck. So, it will be a great idea to have a driverless car. It keeps everyone happy and safe.
