Dear principal

Us students want to help with the cell phone decision. We understand this is a hard decision. But there are many reasons why we should keep our cell phones. first we use our cell phones in case of an emergency. Next we also use them to call are parents.

First, we use our phones for emergency's. If the nurse wasn't at school and we felt as if we broke our leg we can use our phone. We can also use our phone if we get sick. Also when girls have there personal problems we can use it to call our parents. the phones can also be used to text a sick friend the homework assignment. This is some minor reasons we need our phone.

Next we use our phones to call our parents. Some students may need to call there parents incase they need a ride. they may also have forgot there phone and need someone else's. Students need a phone incase they forgot there uniform for a sport they do. this is why we should keep our phones.

Finally there's some reasons you may want to band them but there minor problems.

One of them is because students text during class. But the teachers can just take them away. The students also listen to music. But just besides these two minor problems keep cell phones.

sincerely
