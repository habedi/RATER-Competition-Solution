Dear Principal,

I believe that you should not change the school policy so that only students with a B average of better can play school sports. One reason is because most of your students have a C average, and if you change the policy then a majority of your students will not be able to play sports. Another reason is that the students will lose the opportunity to get exercise they need thus leading to unhealthy students. If you change the policy then the amount of overweight children will rise. I think that you should not change your school policy because students will have nothing to do during the time that they play sports, which leads to the loss of productivity. If you change your school policy then students will not have the energy they need to get through the day which leads to laziness and lower test scores for your children. In my opinion you should not change your policy so that only B average students can participate in sports.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
