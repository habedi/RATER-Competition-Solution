Dear, Principal

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school if they use that during lunch periods and other free times only, as long as they are turned off during class time because if there is something wrong they can contact their parents or after school if they cant find a ride home then they can just call some one.

Another reason i think you should let the student bring their phones to school is because if you don't let them then their will be a lot of students who will do it anyway and then you will have to do something about it so it would be a lot easier to just allow phone to be brought to school. One example is that you will catch a look of students on their phone and you will have to punish them all when it would be a lot easier if they were not doing any thing wrong and that is why i think that student should be allowed to bring phones to school.

sincerely, student
