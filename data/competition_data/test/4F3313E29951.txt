Dear principal,

I think students should only be required to perform community service if they would like, or have time to. Not all people like to help the community and it would be hard for them to participate in something they don't want to do. For other students who love to help out the community in which they live, they should do community service.

For example some people may have a busy family schedule after school hours or on the weekends. It may be a complication if they had to fit other activities in their daily schedule. It would be only fair to understand family schedules.

Another example is that many other students have school activities after school that they are already dedicated to. Community service could interfere with allowing people to do more of what they want with their lives.

Lastly, some students who live in the community may like where they are but don't think they could be of any help. No one should have to do community service they don't want to. They could already be doing something small to help out but not everyone has time to do something big.
