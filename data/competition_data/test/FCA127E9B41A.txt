I would not suguest self-driving cars. What if war ever comes and the enemy were to somehow hack the cars and kill people who are in them. Everyone would require a car upgrade and some people wont be able to afford that. Im good with a 2005 Monte Carlo. Now what they should do is bring classic cars back and start making parts for them again.

In my honest oppinion I believe 1969 was the golden years for cars. I wouldn't want a car that has a camera that watches me while I drive. Thats like too far over the line. I can understand if they made flying cars in the future that uses magnetic power or even fuel of some sort. I honestly believe that we are going to keep creating better and better technology.

Eventually technology is going to be smarter than humanity and it will over run the human race and make us the lowest life force. People need to think for future preferences. Driveless cars would also be a bad idea because some older people don't get technology too well and they could get seriously hurt if they don't opperate the car right. Some people wouldn't want to have a camera in a car that watches them because they may go park somewhere and want to do something private and it wouldn't be private with a camera above their head. Plus people would start to get lazy and not want to drive at all.

Then we may have another obeasity problem. There are just too many concerns and unanswered questions to have self driving cars. I trust a human driver a lot more than an electrical driver any day. I wouldn't want to drive a car thats smarter than me. Theres no telling what could happen with these cars.

Yes they may have been tested and everything but the outcome may vary with different cars. If you ever did wreck I could just imagine how much it would cost to do all of the repairs. Thats why I wouldn't suguest driveless cars.
