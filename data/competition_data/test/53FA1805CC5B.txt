In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" the author tells positive and negative outcomes of drivers . Which leaves me to think that there could be complications with these cars. Yes, it would be cool to see the world evolve before my eyes and see what more the future has to bring but, is this dream even possible?

These cars could maunfunction and someone could get seriously hurt. These cars could also completly change traffic laws . Not only that but how would the future of the world be prepared to take action if they were to mounfunction no one by then would know how to drive a car and wont have a drivers license. is it possible that they could even forget the basic traffic laws ? Like putting your seatbelt on or stopping at a stop light. Questions like these worry meand dont convice me that these cars would be safe.

In the other hand making these cars can advance technology and be a start of changing the world .These cars would be so much easier and wouldnt cause many acccidents if they were to work. Plus who doesnt want a self driving car? It would be so much easier for transpertation. You wouldnt have to wait for the senior citizen to get out of the lane because your in a hurry or wait for the guy ahead of you to notice the traffic light is on green.

If anything I would say i stand in both positions. I am concerned about the safety of theses cars but, wouldnt it be so cool to have your own choffer thats not even existing. To just hang out at he back of the car and final catch up with social media or change the song without having to be cautios of where you are going.

These cars could be the start of something new and could change us all. Making these cars could be the path way to our future. We could all be teleporting next or flying. If they where to work who knows what else we can come across of and make happen. The world is full of possiblites you just have to take the right path and drive through it.
