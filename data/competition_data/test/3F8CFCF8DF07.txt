Can a students' education go beyond the institution at which it's at? There are many debates, conflicting arguments, and controversies over distance learning as a beneficial option for learning students. Some will argue, that it allows students easy access towards their class and it betters their time-management skills. Though others debate that the students learn better in a face-to-face environment with traditional learning techniques. While each of those arguments are compelling, the debaters of said arguments, are not a student themselves, and have probably not taken an online or virtual class. As a student who has taken an online class, I know that it may be very difficult and challenging, but it's very beneficial for the student. Distance learning is extremely beneficial for students who are in need of more credits and a better grade point average.

One of the many arguments against distance learning, is that the traditional teaching method, face-to-face learning, is the best way for a student to learn. This debate is old, weak, and repetitive; the subject of traditional learning has been brought up in many similar arguments, but always ends up silenced by new and improved ways of teaching. One of those improved ways of teaching is distance learning; this form of education is shown to help students with their time management skills and learning capacity, while as traditional learning hasn't improved since it's been implemented. Traditional learning may be the norm, but it isn't what's always best for students; every student has different needs and a different learning style. With the option of distance learning there can be a variety of traditional and distance learning for students to pick and choose from, so that they have every chance to succeed.

One of the major benefits of distance education is the chance to earn more credits throughout the year. Many students at the end of their junior year, scramble to collect enough credits to graduate; with only a limited amount of classes they can take per year, the option to add a needed creditÂ might be lost. This is quickly counteracted by the existence of online classes; distance learning allows for students to take several courses without the "class time" being enforced, unlike taking a traditional class in a school environment. Meaning, that a students classes during the day can be booked while at school, but they can still take a virtual class while outside of school and earn their credits. This is extremely beneficial for the students that need more credits to graduate and don't have the space in their schedule to fit it in, as well as the students planning on graduating early or planning on becoming valedictorian.

There are several benefits of allowing the option for virtual classes, one being that a student may be in need for a higher grade point average. Almost all students have had their GPA drop in their freshman year due to their lack of preparedness, with distance learning there are many ways for a students' grade point average to go up. Though a students' GPA might not go up a full number, there is a chance for their GPA to rise up significantly. With the chance to take more classes than what fit into a students' school schedule, the amount of credits you can have rises and along with it, the grade point average. This gives students the chance to fix their mistakes made in freshman year and get back on track, along with the possibility of more options for their future.

Distance learning is extremely beneficial for students who are in need of more credits and a better grade point average, in which the student is able to use their time wisely, correct past mistakes and look ahead towards the future. This new, innovative way of teaching and learning can be helpful to all students if allowed, for it is beneficial in every possible way.
