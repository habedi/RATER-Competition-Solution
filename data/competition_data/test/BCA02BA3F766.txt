Would students benefit from learning from video conferences at home? I very much disagree with this answer because should attend school in person and actually learn and it would be more effective for them instead sitting at home. If a student has like a medical condition that forces them stay home or keep them home bound, that's the only way they can get their education. If a student was to take online classes, it would the environment that they are in could be a distraction to their learning and it is better for the student to attend school in person and be face to face with teachers and get the same learning experience as everyone else. Also, students that learn from home from home, they can easily cheat at anytime and access notes without the online school knowing and the students wouldn't learn anything from it.

Most people think that online school is good for their students but it really isnt and is it not effective at all. Students that learn through online school can be a huge distraction for them because they are in the comfort of their home and the things around can easily distract the student like phones, their parents, and everything that is around them. Since the student the student thinks because they take online school thinks they can do the work later and go out and have fun, they will get distracted and end up procrastinating on their work and get behind. Today, it's hard to trust students for them to do something on their own because they wont do it or will probably lie about it to get out of doing. This is why they need to be supervised all the time and to make sure they do the work. It will be better for the student attend school in person than doing online school.

About every kid in America goes to school five days a week to get the education that they need. And the students that do online school aren't getting the education they need. Students have the freedom to go to school for free and get the proper education they need. Students can go to school and be able to get the same learning experience as everyone else and be able to interact with people face to face and this helps because its helping them prepare for the future and its better than sitting at home and learning everyday and not being able to talk to people face to face. It's important that students get the proper education they need because they are the future of this world and sitting at home and learning isn't a good option. The students that learn from have it easy because they can access notes and cheat on assignments and test without being caught.

Cheating is very bad and can get you in a lot of trouble and if caught cheating, there can be consequences to that but, if caught cheating while taking online classes there will be no discipline and the online school wont know about it and would be able to tell of the student cheated or not on the assignment or test. Students that cheat will not help them or isnt teaching them anything. Students that do online school think they have it easy because they can cheat on anything at anytime. When they are doing an assignment or test, a parent should in the room at all times and not the teacher they are communicating online because they won't know about it. Kids are pretty sneaky and secretive about everything now so be careful and watch your children when taking online classes or send them to school where they can get the education they need and talk to people face to face.

There's only a few good things about online school like, students that aren't physically able to attend school, they have the option of online school and same goes for the people that can't go to school because they have a long term illness, injury, or a disability. Ever since technology has been out, it keeps getting better and better and now some now online school has become a thing. One thing that its good about it is we can use computers at school and learn and make it more fun. Also, it can prepare us for the future because technology is everywhere. The only time online school is allowed is people that cant physically go to school and they must have permission to take online school also.

Could us people see a increase in online school; yes but not for a good reason. This is another reason why Americans are lazy because they dont want to be around people and they try to get out of every little situation as possible and have it easy. Lastly, Online school cost money and you have the option to attend a public school for free and get the proper education you need to prepare for the future. There are plenty of options for school now and think about what is good for you.
