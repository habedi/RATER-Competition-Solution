Have you ever seen a face on Mars? A landform has been found on a region of Mars called Cydonia. Many argue that the the Face is either a natural landform or a landform created by aliens. Many information from the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" can help come to a conclusion. The "Face on Mars" is just a natural landform.

The first supporting evidence to the claim is that the face would benefit NASA if the Face was made by aliens like people said. Real evidence of aliens would be an informational outbreak. NASA would be credited for an outstanding discovery, so why would they hide a true theory from arguing skeptics?

Second, several other natural landforms are just like the Face on Mars. The picture shows its reseblence to landforms common around western America. Mars Global Surveyor, Garvin, stated, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." Also, The resemblence was "formed by shadows giving the illusion of" a face showing it is just a mesa.

Lastly, supporters of the alien theory believed the Face has alien markings that are hidden. They thought this because of wispy clouds in front of the camera taking the picture appeared. Because "you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size" anyone could see the alien markings they speaked of.

The alien conspirancy of the Face located on the Red Planet can be proven false. Details from "Unmasking the Face on Mars" can support it is just a natural landform, a mesa. These unknown, mysterious aliens people speak of did not build the Face on Mars.
