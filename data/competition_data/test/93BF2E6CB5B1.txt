Limiting car usage can be very beneficial. It would improve communities, reduce pollution, and create better lifestyles.

By reducing the usage of cars, you allow for your community to flourish in other ways than building or repairing roads. Since there would be less people driving cars, the community can focus on other things. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, because of the Day Without Cars, there have been 118 miles of bicycle paths that have been constructed. Also, "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city." Old sidewalks are being replaced with new ones, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have also opened up. All of these great things are happening to the community of Bogota, Columbia, just because they have limited their usage of cars (source 3).

Also, limiting the use of cars would reduce pollution. In places like Paris, France, diesel has been blamed for Paris' days of nar-record pollution. Paris has more smog than most other European capitals, because they have more people driving cars (source 2). "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the US" (source 1).

Finally, decreasing the usage of cars would create better lifestyles for people. People would be healthier and happier, because instead of driving around everywhere, they get some fresh air and more exercise. Heidrun Walter said that "when [he] had a car [he] was always tense. [He is] much happier [not driving his car]" (source 1). Also, don't you hate it when you're stuck in the rush-hour? In Bogota, Colombia, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic (source 3).

Reducing the usage of cars in any community would result in many great things. The community would be able to flourish, there would be less pollution, and people would be living better, happier lifestyles.
