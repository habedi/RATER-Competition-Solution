Dear principal,

This letter is regarding your decision on whether or not to require students to perform community service. I believe that students should be required to do this.

I believe students should perform community service because it will let them meet new people, and give them a sense of what it is like to volunteer for something. It will help them understand what is it like to work. This will help them when they get older and apply for a job.

Most students don't do many activities that are outside of their group of friends. They don't know what working for the community is like. I think that if you would let them do the service in groups, they would be more excited to do it. If not, they might not be as open to the idea.

You could also make it so that if they do extra community service, that could count as extra credit for a class that the work involves. For example, a student that would work at a soup kitchen could get extra credit in math, because they would have to count up all of the donations that they have collected, count the people that they are feeding, and then divide the food equally among the people. This would help the students with their grades, so it would encourage them to do more service.

Having all of the students doing community service would help the city, also. More work could be done at volunteer businesses, and more donations could be collected for clothing and food drives. It would make the whole town a better place.

I hope this letter will let you see that having community service be a requirement at school could benefit everyone. I would appreciate a response letter telling me what you think of my ideas.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
