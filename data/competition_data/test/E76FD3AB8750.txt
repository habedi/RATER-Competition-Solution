Nobody likes school, it's a hassle, whether it's waking up at the crack of dawn and having to use your brain quickly after, or having to sit in a classroom and take in knowledge for 7 hours. Whatever it is, students just are not drawn to the idea. Plenty of kids, in a heartbeat, would love to have the chance to take online classes. Online schools allow for students to be able to learn in a comfortable and familiar setting while still being able to control their own time management.

Taking online classes are not as easy at they might seem. Parents are hesitant to allow their child to attend online classes because they feel as if their child will become unfocused in such a comfortable setting without any supervision to get them back on track. Also, classes online cost a lot of money parents do not want to spend when their student could happily attend school and get an education in person. Students can also become unmotivated and feel as though they dont have to try as hard with online classes as an effect of no teacher or other students to influence their learning.

While all of that is very true, online classes are just an easier option. Waking up early to catch a bus to school, what if you wake up late and miss the bus? Most kids dont have a parent at home or any reliable ride to drive them to school. So they just miss a whole day of school? With online classes you dont deal with problems like that, you wake up anytime you want and are able to attend the classes anytime you would like in the own comforts of your house. Online classes are taken on a computer, no fancy device or specific-expensive computer. It is a quick and easy way to learn and that students would enjoy rather than going and attending an actual school.

Attending school can be hard that is why being able to take classes without having to leave their room is all the more reasons to take these classes. If a student is being bullied at school or is having difficulties in school with teachers or students, taking classes at home in their own space is a relief to them. They are able to continue their studies without having to worry about other things that may distract them from learning or that may put them into a dismal feeling about school. That allows them to develop a more positive emotions towards learning and studying in general. Developing a comfortable relationship with peers or teachers and having to take in knowledge at the same time can take a long time and can be quite stressful. While being in their house allows them to eliminate the factor of dealing with teachers and students, it allows them to learn in a comfortable setting which would be good for people with social anxiety. Students become more comfortable in their own house which allows them to think positively on learning and gets them to focus more on learning while in a familiar place.

Lastly, students are able to control their own time management. Unlike school where they have to sit in a classroom for 7 hours learning, besides getting from class-to-class and eating lunch, there are no breaks for students to recharge. With classes online they are able to space out their classes and even take breaks in between to help them stay motivated and focused. They are additionally able to wake up whenever they want which students who attend schools do not have the privilege to have. After staying up late from doing homework that they got after their 7 hour day at school, they have to wake up early to attend school all over again. That causes students to come to school tired and not being able to learn. Online class gives them the privilege to get a good nights rest so that in the morning they are all ready to learn.

Students would benefit by taking classes at home because everything is by their own control. They are able to control their own time and being able to learn while being in a well known environment. Students are also able to learn better and form a positive experience with taking classes.
