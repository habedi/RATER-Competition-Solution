Dear Principal,

I think students should perform community service because it helps with the community.

One reason is it make the community cleaner and it might make you feel god about yourself. Another reason is it could teach the students discipline so when they do some thing bad they will always no that they have to do community surface for there punishment. Another reason that students should do community service is that they might get rewarded for it later in life like they could get into a good collage just because the helped with a little community surface.

Another reason why I think students should have to do community service is so they all could work together on one thing and learn to get along. Another reason is if you don't like someone you could try to work together on community service and maybe cause you both did something together you could be more friendly.
