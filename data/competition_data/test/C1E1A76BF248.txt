Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. On the planet's surface tempertures average over 800 degrees Faherenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experience on our own planet. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained in the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. It tells us that if anyone went to venus the pressure will probably be hot as an oven like as heat and Other forces, and it can cause danger to people who goes there Venus's surface only lasted for three weeks in such conditions. But should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. A thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atomsphere. Venus is the second planet from our sun

Venus is like erupting volcanoes, powerful, earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking land on its surface. Radiation of venus would not exceed earth levels.
