Dear Principle

I think that it is not right to require a B grade average to participate in sports.

Not all of the kids are capable of getting a B grade average. Most of the reasons why is mainly because of people struggling in their classes. If this were to go into affect, less people would try out for these sports teams. The only positive thing i see in this idea is that it will make students try harder to get better grades in their classes to have activity status to participate in these activities.

Lots of people struggle to get a B or even a C average. In my opinion, I don't think grades should be a requirement to do extra activities. Personally i can get a B average but making that extra pus for it can be quite stressful at times. As i said previously, this is mostly a negative thing to do for the most part.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
