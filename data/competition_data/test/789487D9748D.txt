This teachnology is the new technology that can read whether the person is happy, sad,angry or fear. It said when you open up a computer and something pop up that make you smile the technology will give you more of that. Although, this teacnology is useful i think to some students it might be valuable because if they study about art they might think is useful and valuable to them. On the other hand some students might think is not valuable because they are not intersted in this techology and they might feel unsafe around it.

This technology Is useful in a way because it detect how other people are feeling,even when they are hideing their emotions.
