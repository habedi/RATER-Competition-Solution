The picture that has been roaming our society for 25 years and counting, is known as "The face on mars." The " Face on mars" has been put in hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery store lines. Many people believe that this face was created by aliens, and its not just a natural landform. But I can almost prove to you that this "face" was not created by aliens and is infact a natural landform.

First, If the face-like landform was created by aliens why would that be the only mark? Usually if the face was created by aliens there would surely be a way bigger mark. As well as there would be plenty more marks surrounding that face. This proves that this mark is simply just a landform.

Also, there is plenty of life-like landforms created with the surface of the area. Just so it happens to be on a planet doesn't mean there has to be a wild explanation to this landform. There is life-like landforms that sometimes look a a full body and there are some that look like half of a body. Many of those landforms have been scientifically proven to be just a landform. Also, with all the human shaped landforms we have all of them should be claimed to be created by aliens! Once again, there is no way this landform can be created by aliens. Yes it is indeed unusual but if humans cant travel to Mars how would aliens be able to travel to mars? It's impossible for aliens to make this landform.
