I agree because all students should have good grade's to do any sport . They should have good grade's for any sport because they can be a scholar athletic and it can help them in along run . also , they grade's should be high to attend to any sports because students need there education before they thinking about doing anything else in school other then work . Another , reason is kids should be focus on school work ; cause if they do any sports they will not be as focus as they should be . Even , if they did sports they will like to attend then students will do any thing that's possible to get they grades to a higher level ; they also can bring they grade's high because of sports .

Students , should be able to get they grades high . they should be able to ask for extra help ; stay after for tutoring . just to improve there grades . ; to get into any sports . As my opinion , i think that students should have a C and up to attend to any thing , activities , sports , fun day . Good grades and athletic can make a very great student !
