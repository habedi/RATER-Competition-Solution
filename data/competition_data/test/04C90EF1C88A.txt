In the article "Making Mona Lise Smile," the author describes a wonderful technological advancement called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This technology allows for computers to analyze a human face and determine the emotion, or emotions, that person is feeling. With the help of this new software, Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at tge University of Illionois, and Professor Nicu Sebe, of the University of Amsterdam, were able to determine that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. This outstanding innovation can be very beneficial to society. They have created something that can not only help us have a better understanding of the body, but can also change the way we communicate in drastic ways.

With FACS we, as people, will be able to better understand the anatomy behind joy, depression, anger, all of it! We will have access to parts of the brain that millions of scientists have never understood. FACS creates oprotunity for discovery far beyond what we already know. For centuries scientists have been asking, "What makes a happy person happy?" and "What is causing all these mood swings?" With these advancements applied, we can know when a change in mood happens and use brain scans to figure out where and why this is happening.

"Communication is key!" That's something we all hear all of the time but no one seems to be any good at. The suicide rate is out of control and the divorce rate is crazy high. Using FACS we can deminish these numbers! A simple understanding of the emotions another human is displaying can change, and save, lives. If we have the technology to understand what a person is feeling, then we can fix things before they completly fall apart. We can offer solutions to the problems that people are facing everyday simply by understanding how they feel and what is causing their hurt. This technology could be the difference between wether or not your parents stay together or your friend jumps off a bridge. That is why I believe this technology should be immediately incooperated into society. It can save lives, it can save love.

FACS is an important technology that needs to be applied to everyday life as soon as possible. Not only will it change the world for the better but it will be the difference between life and death.
