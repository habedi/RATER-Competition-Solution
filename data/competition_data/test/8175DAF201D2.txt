Dear TEACHER_NAME

Community Service would probably not be such a good idea. Kids these days are more Lazy and very violent, very few of them are going to be the volunteer type. Why i say this is because if you take a good look around the school, you will see them everywhere bullying and not doing work and coming in late. Then there are those very rare ones who will do homework and not bully and actually do something good for everyone's lives. By doing this kids are just going to rebel against your community service act and just wont do it and there might be those that will do it, but that is because they want to and want to get somewhere in their lives. By doing this its just going to make things get worse where they will rebel. Make a very wise decision about this rule, for it has a good chance of either going bad or going very well.

This one is a little bit like bag the bag and it went good and bad. This rule has three outcomes now, going good and bad or bad or going good. Those that are selected to tutor will most likely do it. The litter part will go worse however since kids just don't want to do things most of the time. If some kids think of bag the bag there is a good chance they just wont do their part in community service and there will be some bad outcomes in that. But if they don't think of bag the bag you have a chance of them doing their part in community service. In my personal opinion it is not too bad of an idea but others will think it is a bad idea so there are those who will take part in it and there are those who will not do it and get very lazy overall its not too bad of an idea in my opinion of course.
