Should summer projects be Teacher-designed, or Student-designed? I believe that summer projects should be mainly Student-designed, with teacher approval. I believe this because of my own personal experiences. Students that I've seen who receive summer projects are not very interested, if ever interested, in the project assignments they receive. A way to get them more engaged is to have them pick a topic they would be interested in. As long as it pertains to the class of course, this is where teacher approval would take place.

I believe summer projects should be Student-designed. One of the reasons I believe this is because I've seen students struggle with assignments they don't like, so much so, it can come to a point where they either give up, or don't even attempt it. My second reason is because it adds a level of involvement from the student, that ensures they're aware of how the assignment is to be done, as well as, their own personal spin on what their project is going to be.

Summer projects should be Student-designed because prompts given by teachers can be quite boring, causing a lack of drive to finish the project, let alone attempt it. Some kids partake in summer jobs, or leave for vacation. The situation concerning the varying student should be reflected in their summer projects as being individualized. What I mean for this is, a student who is busy all the time doesn't always have the time to do a project. Even if they enjoy the content. The form of their project should also vary due to their location. Weather they're traveling all the time, and can only complete the project on an airplane, or maybe they live in an environment without constant Wifi. Giving the student the opportunity to form their own assignment can add a level of enjoyment, to an already chaotic lifestyle that any student could be living with. Rather the alternative. A standardized project that only 65% of students are likely to turn in.

My Second reason is the level of involvement shown by a student who gets to choose their own topic. Not only will they be more involved, and in sync with what they need to accomplish, they will be able to complete it faster, if not better than they would without their own involvement. Showing this type of involvement can help the student have a better understanding on what their end goal is, and how they can accomplish it, resulting in better work. As well as readiness in the classroom when they come back from summer break. Seeing as how the students don't receive teacher guidance over the summer, if they have a full understanding on their own project, it can result to having a better understanding for the transition into the next year.

Someone who would disagree with my statements would believe that Teacher-designed summer projects are much better for the student. Some reasons for this would be, an extra workload on the student, or possible inappropriate content chosen by the student. In a students life there can be little free time, as life is different for each student, and adding on the creation of their own project, just adds onto the workload for both teachers and students.

In conclusion I believe that summer projects should be student oriented. A student can show more interest in a personalized project. Secondly a student can gain a better comprehension on what theyre trying to learn from their own project that they enjoy. While some would say that it's an extra burden on teachers to add individualized projects, I believe that the American education system needs to be less standardized. and more individual. We all learn differently, and not every method of teaching is helpful t'words a students education.
