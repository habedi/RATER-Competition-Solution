During the summer leading up to my eighth grade year, my mom suggested that I get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids.

I thought for a while, then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team.

When the practices first started that July, things were running pretty smoothly;however, once the school year started a couple of weeks later, things got a quite a lot tougher.

I had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice.

As the season went on, I learned a lot of stuff about football and school, but most importantly, I had lots of fun doing it.

I am so glad that I took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because I found that to be true for me as well.

Consequently, I agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

First, I think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new, real world skills.

There are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom, but are needed for a successful career.

For example, when I played football, I learned the importance of working together on a team with other people.

When we all learned to work as one team, we started to play really good and win games.

On the other hand, if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork, it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job.

Just imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you.

Would you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity, or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling?

You would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job.

Secondly, everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work.

Most kids today don't want to do their homework, and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear, which usually results in bad grades.

However, being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club, they must do their work before anything else.

For example, during football season, I had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades, or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team.

Similarly, being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce.

Just like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills, you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well.

Some of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills, but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position.

Lastly, extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive.

As mentioned earlier, students these days only like to do the fun stuff, not the work.

Extracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun, but also learn valuable lessons.

As a result of the activities being fun, students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it, which helps both the students and the teachers get along better.

Additionally, most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it, while they will forget about all the important stuff.

But in extracurricular classes, the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals, so that when students remember the fun stuff, they will also remember the skills that they learned as well.

For example, one day during football practice, our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers.

I vividly remember this because it was really exciting when I got to do it, although, when I think about it, I also remember that in order to do it, I had to get low and run with the proper technique.

It was because of fun things like that drill that I was able to stick with the game and improve my skills.

So as you can see, I agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

Just like how I had to alter my work schedule when I played football, extracurricular activities might not be that easy, but I can promise you that in the long run, they are worth participating in.

So even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you, go ahead and just give one a try.

There are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone, so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy.

I guarantee that you will not regret it at all!
