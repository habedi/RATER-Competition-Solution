It is a good technology to have. People can lie about how they feel. In the painting of Mona do u really know she was happy. No a comupter can say that but it a painting of the person that is not around. So you don't know it just he face everyday. She has no eyebrows so how can you so she is suprised. In the text it says your eyebrows Well you cant have that if there isn't any.

So thing that it is a good technology to have but it just not proven to work on paint. The students don't realy need to know how to use a computer to see how people are feeling. People most of the time you can tell by looking on there faces. Why is it important to know picture or a painting is feeling when you look at it should do it for you. How do you say she is 83 percent happy you can't put that like it a math problem. Because you don't know how see really feels because it could just be a face for all we know.

That is why I think is would be worthless for students to use it. They cant use a comupter to see how someone is feeling inside them. It is a good advancement and can be use but in another way. People can hide how they are feeling just by there face. It also not something students need to learn to go far in life.
