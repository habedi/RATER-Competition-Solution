Well I don't think that is fair. A C average is not that bad of a grade. I think the best way was the policy before, but you should be able to contain a B average through out the course of the year. The thing with it is, is that you should be having pretty bad grades to not be able to be playing sports.

It shows that you really don't care about the sports or your really not trying hard enough. What if you have somebody who's school isn't there best activitie to do, and maybe there just not good at it and they care about there school and there sports. They maybe just don't get good grades. what do you describe good grades though? A,B,C, maybe even D. D is passing and as long as your passing all of your classes then i think you should deserve to go out and play the sports you like to do, I don't like the idea at all about the new policy. I don't think its fair and they should not change it. School is not the easiest thing to do, it takes lots of hard work and lots of studying. I would never accept having a D but the thing is, is that your passing and your doing good enough to be going out playing sports. There is no reason either to go out and change it. The big thing i am trying to say is passing is passing and school isn't the easiest thing to do, so a B average is not fair to do. For me it would take a lot to average a B . I'm sure just not me but lots of people probably a lot of people. It just hard to do. Ill just close it saying it is not fair to some people to make it that hard, and keep the policy where it is.
