I think this technology would be very valuable in classrooms. Being able to know about how a student feels about a subject could be very helpful. This would enable Teachers to adjust thier teaching style and make it easier for the student to understand the subject. Not only would it help the teachers, but the entire class as well. Teachers would be able to see if students needed individual help or if they needed to go over it as a class again.

As said in the article, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This also supports the fact that this technology could be valuable in classrooms. Not only the teacher could be able to change the lesson for a student, but the lesson itself could change for the student. This would make the student be less bored and more excited and enjoy the lesson that they are currently learning.

As technology evolves, we will use it more and more for the better use of people. This could possibly be the first step for making school a better place for students to enjoy learning. They could have personal computers that would adjust to thier learning speeds and needs. This would no doubt make school more enjoyable and easier to understand for students that are having trouble.
