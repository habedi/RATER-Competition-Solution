Most schools require students to complete a summer project to make sure that students are still expanding their knowledge while school is closed. These summer projects are long, uninteresting, and tiring. Most students refuse to complete a summer project. Summer projects should be made into something that students would want to do and enjoy doing. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be creative, students can pick an assignment that is best for their knowledge capability, and students become more intrigued with their assignment.

Typically when summer projects are assigned from a teacher, they're similar assignments. When summer projects are similar, they attend to make all students the same and strips away any originality. Students need to be able to show their individuality through their work. Research shows that when students choose their assignments, they exceedÂ by forty-five percent more than a teacher-assigned assignment. Creativeness is something that should be essential to students because that it was forms them as a whole and makes them unique to themselves. Each summer project would allow students to express themselves in ways that a teacher-assigned summer project can't. Creativity is something that is with-in a person and something that should never be taken away from an individual.

Students come in variety, from ethnicity, gender, age, and most importantly in this case, teaching perforations. Students will learn a lot better if they were allowed to pick their own assignments because they could create a summer project that is perfect for their learning pace. For example, I observed that when I am completing an assignment that is not too fast or not too slow for me, I do better tremendously. Summer projects are so horrific already, at the very least students should be able to decide what is best for their learning capacity. Pacing would set students up for great improvement and succession.

Students will become more interested in their summer project. Most students will not complete or do well on something that they are not interested in. An article stated that, because students are so young, and their brain has not developed yet, their attention span is very short. Meaning that students will not focus on anything for a very long time, especially something that is boring and has no significance to them. Evidence also shows that each year the passing rate and or completion rate of summer projects never exceed or increase, the rates always decrease. Students will be intrigued with their work if its assigned by them. If teachers keep assigning summer projects then the passing rate of the summer projects will continue to decrease, students need to stay interested and the most important way to have that happen is to allow them to choose their own summer project assignment.

Summer projects need to cater to students to cause improvement. Students do not require much to be successful,teachers just have to have the ability to allow their students to be flexible with their work. It is important that teachers grasp knowledge of how important it is that a student remains creative,that a student can pace themselves,that students remain intrigued, and most importantly students become successful with their summer projects. Summer projects are a wonderful idea but being student-assigned is way better.
