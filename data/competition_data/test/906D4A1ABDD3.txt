Have you ever wanted to travel overseas to visit places while at the same time helping others and having fun? That can happen you just have to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. At this program you can help others by taking care of the animals on a cattle boat that you ride from place to place. You also get to visit the unique places at the location your heading. Finally when its time for the return trip you get to have loads of fun by playing all sorts of fun games on the cattle boat.

Like I said before you get to help people which makes yourself feel really proud. You help them by bringing them animals so they can recover from the war. After helping people you get to see all the unique places at the place you visit. For example I once got to visit the Acropolis in Greece which was pretty special. Finally its time to return but the return trip isn't sad its exciting, because you get to play all sorts of games from tennis tournaments to whittling.

I personally enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy so you should join. Remember all the fun you will have on the return trip! Also remember that you are helping people so you should feel proud of yourself. Finally don't forget to visit all the fun and unique sites at the places you visit. I hope you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
