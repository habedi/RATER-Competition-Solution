Does taking online classes benefits your knowledge?

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend home by way of online or video conferencing. This great opportunity give differences options to the students interesting in different environment of learning;therefore some people take this option to discern their own future. Take position of our own responsibilities it is a benefit to grow in our own knowledge. Not all humans beings with the same opportunities in life,yet this option it is a great help for many students with trials or obstacles attending school,but with the objective to get a career in the future.

In my position in this issue it is basically in the techniques of learning opportunities, so they can focus in what their doing,obtain a better concentration ,and they can not distract with other students; while the students can get a better storage of learning and better grow of knowledge......sometimes the majority of students taking online classes finish school before regular students. In my other hand they can have more options to expend their times, and they can organize their own activities, they can practice: deports, learn to play instruments, classes of differences languages,or get a job;this activities can help you to prepare your own adult life. Be volunteer it is other curricular option to practice your own values, but some people can not practice this activity because it is during time of school,so taking online classes permit employ and organize your own time.

Other big topic of my choice is the single mothers,unfortunately people make mistakes,but in the main time affect their future;therefore this opportunity benefit to them because they need to pay to somebody to take care of the baby ,and they need to find a job for survive; this opportunity make more flexible their life. Other of my examples is that part of some students leave school, because their parents need to work,and they need to support their family to survive,getting money,finding a job,taking care of their siblings,or helping with home responsibilities.

In this days the significant of values is lost,other of the benefits taking online classes it is that people can save their values without relationships or persons that can not change your personality,many times when you go to regular school you know persons that change your main of thought,behave,and see that provoke consequences for your own future, because you take incorrect decisions. The opportunity to take classes online make your life more safe, and make feel your parents more faithful to know with who you relate;taking online classes make yourself more responsible of your achieves, because if you decided take online classes depends just you if you completed and graduated.

In my other hand,people believe this is not a good option for ESOL students because it is a difficult task learn other language, and taking online classes do not help you,learn other language consist in first place listening stage,and this requirement the support of a teacher to explain and remark what you do not understand;the teacher can give you the answers of all questions that you have, other stage it is the writing part, and people disagree to use translated because you do not learn,and would be more difficult in the future to go to the collage, and the speaking stage it is important too,but if you take online classes and you do not practice it is more difficult achieve the purpose and learn the language.

This great opportunity give differences options to the students interesting in different environment of learning;therefore some people take this option to discern their own future;this issue it is basically in the techniques of learning opportunities,so they can focus in what their doing,obtain a better concentration ,and they can not distract with other students; while the students can get a better storage of learning and better grow of knowledge,and the majority of students taking online classes finish school before regular students. Decide take online classes has a lot of benefits,make yourself more responsible,and it is a great option to decide how to expend you time.
