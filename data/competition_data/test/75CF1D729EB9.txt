Dear Principle,

I suggest you go with policy 1 that will allow student to use their phone in school as long as it is off during class. This policy will cut down on the rates of people texting during class and maybe even bring some peoples grades up because they wont forget their work and can ask somebody to get it for them. It would reward the students for there hard work and their attention in class. There would be no more sneaking phones into class texting while the teacher is not looking. that way the can focus on their class work and they can understand it and get a good grade.

If you went with policy 2 then kids would sneak their phones into class and instead of focusing on their work their focusing on not getting caught. So now they don't how to do there homework and fail a test. If their not aloud to have phones at school then what will they do if they need to talk to their parents after school, or need to get a ride with friends. phone are almost a nessicty kids need to help them with school and other things out side of school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
