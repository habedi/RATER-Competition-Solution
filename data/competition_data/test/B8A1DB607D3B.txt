Could Earth end up turning out like Venus? NASA has sent many spacecrafts to Venus trying to figure out what it is like under the atmosphere. Although it may seem like a waste of time to send stuff there, studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers because it can teach us more about our solar system, it can possibly be a replacement planet, and if we find out that it was like Earth we could try and fix Earth before it happens again.

Studying the planet Venus would help us better understand the rest of our solar system. The taxt says "A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus (Paragraph 3)." It also states "and the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet (Paragraph 3)." We haven't seen anything like this, which is why we need to study it.

Venus could possibly be a replacement planet for Earth. We just need to find out how we could make it a liveable planet incase the Earth just keeps getting worse and worse. It states "Often referred to as Eath's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size (Paragraph 2)." The text also states that "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth (Paragraph 4)." These mean that at one point we couldv'e lived on Venus since it was so much like Earth.

If we were to keep studying Venus and we find lots out about it then we could see if Earth would eventually turn out like that. As stated "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth (Paragraph 4)." Another point is that "Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth...such as valleys, mountains, and craters (Paragraph 4)." This says that Earth and Venus look a lot alike and they could be "twin" planets which also means that the Earth could end up one day being just like Venus.

We need to study more about Venus to help out ourselves and the Earth, so we don't end up like Venus. They either need to send ships to research Venus to help Earth or having to find another planet for our future generations to live on.
