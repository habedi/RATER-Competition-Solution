Some people do extracurricular activities and some people donÃÂ´t. Do you wanna be forced to do something you donÃÂ´t want to do. This is why you should not be forced to do extracurricular activities after school if you donÃÂ´t want to. So this is why you should not be forced to extracurricular activity.

Some kids do not have time to do after school actives because the have work at home like if they live on a farm or have a other paying job. Some people might just want to go home after a long day of school they might be exhausted or tired and wore out from a long eight hour school day. Kids just wanna be kids and go outside and play with there friends and family. Fresh air helps the brain function better and faster

Other kids like to stay home and just chill and relax. Some people are more comfortable at home than at school or work. Some kids have to study for a big test the next day and worry if they are gonna pass or fell the big test if you have after school actives that cuts into you time that you need to be studying to be prepared for the big test that could pass or fell you. If you donÃÂ´t study you might not get that good of a score if you would have study that night.

when kids have homework they need time to sit down and to work through it. If kids have multiple classes with homework due in every class thats going to take a while to get finished. If you dont get to your homework because of your extracurricular activates the teachers wonÃÂ´t care they will give you lunch detention because you dont have it or you did not finished it. If you do extracurricular actives then come home and then have to do homework you will be up late and you wont get nothing done. Then if you come to school tired you will get yelled at by a teacher because you where tired and that you have to stay up all the night doing homework.

those are just a few reasons that extracurricular activities can be a time consuming part of your day that can be use for other important thing like sleep,working,homework,relaxing,studying and, for a big test or wanting to be a kid and be with friends. That is why i think that you should be able to chose if you want or dont want to be in a extracurricular activity.
