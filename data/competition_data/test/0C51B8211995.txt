I believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very useful and rather valuable. The computer would be able to tell what we're interested in and give us articles about those interests. It could also help improve students grades or help entertain them if they're bored out of their mind, or even help art students create more life like paintings.

If these types of computers were in classrooms today, it could help give students articles and suggested sites based on what they're interested in. For example, if the teacher says that the students must choose a story to read, but it had to be online, the computer would be able to give a list of suggested stories, and, based on the students facial expression while reading each title, it could give the article that would be the best for that student. If students are interested in a topic, they are most likely to read more and more about it, thus improving their lexile level and reading comprehension.

On the other hand, it could also distract students from their school work. When the students have free time, they will play games, watch videos, etc., while the computer reads the students face while they are doing so. Making it more likely for the computer to suggest more and more unnecessary things for the student that is trying to work, thus getting distracted easily. This will cause the student to work less and less.

This type of technology could also help art students. As an artist, I personally know how hard anatomy is for newer and younger artists, and even older artists (everyone has trouble with something). It will help them to create lie like faces with the correct facial expression to match the emotion they are looking for. Not that how life like is painting determines the quality of the painting, but it will still help the realistic artists to create much more life like and will help them improve their artistc ability.

In conclusion, I believe that this technology has a positive and a negative use for students in classrooms. It will help them improve their reading and even their art, but there is also a high posibility that students can get easily distracted by this. However, there are far more positive uses for this kind of technology than there are negative, so I'd say that the use of this technology would be very valuable to students in classrooms.
