Many students have been either forced or pressured to do an extracurricular activity. They might be forced or pressured by a parent/guardian, teacher, or friend. However, that doesn't mean they should do the activity. The principal should not force students to participate in an extracurricular activity because, students might not have time to do an activity, might be forced to do an activity they don't like, or the activities might suffer.

While some students have plenty of extra time to use after school, some may not. Students can usually get their homework done either after school or during resource. Though, they don't always do it in a healthy way. Some have to stay up late to get an assignment done either because, they forgot when it was due, waited till the last minute to do it, didn't realize how big it was, or have a field trip or special event they are going to. This causes the student to not get a healthy amount of sleep, which causes them to have trouble paying attention in class. Also some students decide to take all honors classes, which usually give out more homework than normal classes. If the student has to deal with an after school activity on top of all of this, then they will have a very annoying schedule.

Sometimes parents force their kid to do an extracurricular activity. Usually the student either finds out that they enjoy the activity, or that they hate it. If they hate it they could ask their parents if they can stop doing the activity, but the parent could say no. Then the kid is stuck doing this activity even though they don't want to do it. The same problem can happen if a friend asks them to do an extracurricular activity with them. The kid might find out that they don't like the activity, but they don't want to upset their friend, so they continue to do the activity. If the principal says the students have to take an extracurricular activity, a few of the students might not want to do any of the possible activities. This would would mean at least a few students would be forced to do an activity they don't enjoy. If students are forced to take an extracurricular activity, then they could get stuck doing something they don't want to do.

There are hundreds of kids in a school. If the principal were to say that every student in the school has to do at least one extracurricular activity, it would be a mess. The after school activities that the school offers would be overflowing with students. If the school had only one team for each sport, the school would need to make a lot more. If more teams are made more equipment will be needed, which means the school would have to use more money. Also the teams themselves would suffer, because there are bound to be kids who don't even like the sport who are only there because they have to be. This could also happen with almost any other activity in the school. If students are forced to take an extracurricular activity, the activities will suffer.

If students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity, students won't have enough time to do assignments, might be forced to do an activity they dislike, and the activities the school offers will suffer. Though it may seem like a good idea to have all the students do an extracurricular activity, it will be a pain for the students and the school.
