Some schools do require students to do projects over summer break, however i do think they should be student-designed. The students should design a project that they would be interested to do, but the teacher would have to revise the project to make sure its a project involving school. Also the teacher can see work that the students picked and chose to do, and the teacher could learn more about that student.

The students project should be about something that interests them in their life. The teacher would still make sure its an appropriate topic to do, but for the most part the student should pick and choose what he or she will do. I remember in elementary school my teacher assigned a summer project called, "All about me". Even though she picked the topic to the project me and the rest of the students had to really put together the project because it was a personal project that was about ourselves. It was a fun project to do for the most part. I got to put all of my work on a poster board; i talked about my favorite hobby, sport, and color. I also talked about how many sibings i have and their names and ages. It was a good project to do over the summer because it wasn't too overwelming.

A student-designed project lets the teacher know more about that person an how he or she does their work. Students would most likely pick a topic on something easy, but i dont think thats a issue. The students should pick something that they dont have to sit down and think too hard about. It's summer time they dont want to sit down to do a school project during the summer and have to stress about how they dont know how to do it and they just end up not doing it because it was too hard and overwelming. Everyone knows when they get frustrated when their doing something important they just want to give up because they feel like it wont be good enough. Thats how i feel when a teacher gives me work to do and i find it difficult and not interesting i just wanna give up and not do it.

When students are on their summer break mostly everyone goes out of town or their working, so they dont really have a lot of time on their hands. The teacher should atleast let their students do the project in however form they want too as long as they complete the task, i dont think they should be counted out for how little the project is when its completed. As long as the student has all the right points on his or her project they should get a completion grade for even starting it over the summer break; the time where everyone should be relaxing and just having a good time, not doing a school project in the middle of summer break. Like who wants to be out at a resort somewhere for vacation and all of a sudden you remember you have a project that is a lot of points due right when you come back from break ,like thats a lot of stress. It would be so much easier to do a project you picked yourself because you would already know what your gonna put down on your project. You wouldnt have to think so hard on one task.

All the schools that assign summer projects they should let the students pick and choose what they want to do it on, so they wont be stressed out when their supposed to be relaxing on their break from school. Students should want to do the project because its a easy grade and they know exactly what they will talk about.
