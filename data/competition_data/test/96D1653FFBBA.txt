Dear principle,

I am currently a student at your school. I am not going to give out my name because, well you might just give me an even worse grade then I have now. So I am going to tell you why I think that making the school policy being changed is not a very bright idea. Sure their are plenty of great kids here that have good grades, but the kids that have just decent grades go all out with their sportsmanship. I happen to no this because I did indeed research this with kids all over this school and the closest school to this one. The results were that kids with an average c are more competitive witch is good for basketball, volleyball, football, well mostly all of them. C average kids spend most of their time practicing or just playing around with the sport after school, witch makes them better, you know what they say "practice makes perfect!" Well and then you have b average students who well lets just say are more worried about their grades and not their sports witch is probably better in the end. Did you no that you can also get into college just by being a great player on your team? I did, so think about it, either way your guaranteed to get into college and c average is not bad at all. Most schools say you cant play if you have below a 68, that's a D-. So I personally think that you should reconsider your thoughts.

yours truly, unknown
