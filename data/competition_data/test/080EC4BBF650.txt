Dear Principal,

I think that it is very good to help the community and i think that it should be a requirement because it is very important. I think this for a few reasons, there are always people around us that need help with something and us younger people should take the time and help them. Also, it can benefit the students in a few ways.

There are many people that could use help in the community and it wouldn't be hard for us students to help them. For example, an older person that lives on your block and has a hard time shoveling the driveway when it snows a lot. You could always go help them and they would appreciate it very much. Things like that wouldn't effect the student a lot because he or she was probably already shoveling his own driveway. That is just one example of a simple way a student could make someone's day a lot better.

After helping someone with some thing they maybe couldn't do by themselves or helping with something that benefits the environment it always makes me feel good about myself knowing that i did something positive. This may help the students confidence and also may help them with interacting with other people. For example, I have volunteered at a summer camp for elementary school aged kids and it helped me a lot with interacting with other leaders like me and learning to problem solve. I think things like that could also help may other students.

That is why i think it could be very beneficial to have students participate in community service. I hope you will com
