Projects play a huge role in the world that we live in today. A great amount of these amazing advancement in many fields have been made due to project work. When working on a project at school, many students can learn to form an amazing bond with one another and they can also learn from the experience. A multitude of students forget about school completely during summer break, so having them work on something can help them stay informed on a certain topic. These projects during summer break should be student-designed because it will show the students creativity, it will assure the completance of the assingment, and it will allow the teacher to see what the student's capabilities are.

Showing creativity can be a very difficult thing for many students. It is equivalent to pulling someone out of their comfort zone. In the show Victorious, the theater teacher notices that his students face difficulty in expressing their creativity. Furthermore, he decides to let them create their own act to present to the class. By doing this he notices that his students are acting more free spirited and being more creative. When a teacher allows their students to create their own projects, they will notice a change in the students behavior. The amount of creativity will rise. The spark in the students eyes will show it all.

Whenever a teacher says that there is going to be a big project coming up, you can always see the fear in many people's eyes because they think that they are going to end up procrastinating and not finish the project. Adding on, a teacher-designed project can make an individual feel caged in because there is only a minimum amount of ideas that they are allowed to use. Last year, my chemistry teacher made us create our own projects on an experiment we did during class. I did my project on chromotagraphy, and I was very delighted to work on it because the experiment really interests me. Adding on, I was very joyful to share my ideas with my collegues. During the project, my teacher saw the work effort that many students put in; she also realized that a lot more students had actually completed the assignment.

During the summer many students have no motivation to complete any tasks, so if you tell a student to complete a certain project they will most likely end up procrastinating until a couple days before the due date. Furthermore, the teacher will probably end up getting a lousy piece of work that someone put up in approximately two days. This will never allow the teacher to see what the student is capable of doing. In The Office, a Netflix series, Michael asks his collegues to come up with a plan to save the workplace because they were going bankrupt. By doing this, he begins to realize that his employees have an immense amount of capabilities. He also begins to see all of their efforts and the amount of work that they could put in on a certain task, which had never happened before. I think we can relate this to a school environment because if a teacher tries to capture the student in a box, then the student will always think it is okay to stay in the box. Some people may believe that a teacher-designed project is the fairest way to assist an assignment. However, many teachers get extremely lousy grading the same thing over and over again. I have seen my teachers take a great amount of time to grade even the smallest assignments because they get tired of seeing a repitition of work. Adding on, if everyone were to do a project on the same idea there would be no variation.

Placing the student in a box and not allowing them to express their creativity should not be how a task is graded. Students should not be kept to a certain amount of ideas; rather, they should be able to show what they are capable of doing. By allowing students to design their own projects during summer break, the students can show off their creativity, complete the assignment, and allow the teachers to see the students capabilities. It would also make the teacher's lives immensely easier because they do not have to create a summer assignment for the students to complete. This is preparing the students for their future becaue they are not always going to have assistance on particular things, so it is a good thing to teach them to be independent now.
