I think students should be able to student-design their own project over summer break. This would be a better idea because then students can pick a topic that they are interested in or want to learn more about. Also students should assign their own projects because they could have more ideas on what they could do about their project. Students deserve to pick their own topic becasue then they don't have to stress over their topic that much and they can pick something easy to do their project on so their brains get a break and don't have to think about it as much.

I think that students should assign their own projects because then they can pick a topic that they find interesting or a topic that they want to learn a lot more about. Students can do a lot more when they pick their own topics because then they can pick something that will not be hard to find a lot of information about. Also if they pick a topic that they are more interested in then they can have a lot more ideas on what to do for their project. Then they could have a better chance at doing well on their project because they can find a lot of information, be creative and have fun with it at the same time.

When summer time comes around, students don't want to be working all the time. They want to focus on summer and not have to think at all. Picking their own topic would be a great idea. If students pick their own topic and they pick something that they already know a lot about. Then students wouldn't have to think as much and can do their project as they please. Also they wouln't have to stress about it because they have a topic that they love. Also they can put so much effort into their project.

When it comes to summer students want to relax and not think about school or learning. So I think students should pick their own project and then they can get more done with this project. Also when they pick something that they love then they have a much better chance on doing well on this project. Teachers love to see projects that are well-done and they look like someone put the effort in. Students will have a great amount of time to work on these projects. Some students may get their projects done in a week then they don't have to worry about it which is great also. With that being said, students should design their own projects so then they can have more fun with it.Â
