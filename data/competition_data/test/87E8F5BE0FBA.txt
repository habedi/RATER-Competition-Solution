The temperature in Venus is over 800 degress, and the atmosphere is 900 times greater than what we have in Earth. The temperature in Venus is dangerous for people to visit. It can cause death or other bad symptoms for your body. Other than all the dangerous things that Venus can cause, is that Venus is the most alike planet. Venus used to be only coverd in oceans. Venus is one of the best planets. Mercury is very close to the sun but it's not the hottest planet, and Venus is not close to the sun but it still has a very high temperature. Both planets are beautiful to visit and also are beautiful to look at. Venus still has those feautures where it kinda look like Earth's feautures. It just looks like it has rocky mountains, and greyish but still looks pretty to look at. If you are planning to visit Venus, you can not step into the planet and feel it. The best way to avoid dangerous situations is looking only at the planet. The air pressure is similar to Earth. On paragraph 3 it says "These conditions are far extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals" and on paragraph 5 it say's "At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degress fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. In conclusion there is still a lot to say about Venus that NASA is still working on, and there would be many more things to say about it.
