Dear School Principle,

I'm writing to you to inform you that what your trying to do is unfair. Many students don't have a B average, Or are bad test takers so their grade is lower.

For instances some students get nervous and can't think straight when taking a test. So when there teacher grades them its an F already. That's not really not fair.

Also what if a student is absent and you has three test and he/she didn't get to take them and their teacher gave them all their missing work and said. "These must be returned in one week. What if there is like twenty papers of math book reports, an projects. You can't read like four books in one week that's impossible. A bunch of projects do? Well your not getting that turn in it takes at least three days to do a single project. Math home work? I can't do it. It will make my brain pop.

Do you see how much a teacher loads you with homework there is no way will you turn it all in. So when you tell the teacher. "I didn't have enough time to finish it all. Your teacher may reply like this: "Well I'm sorry a week was plenty time for you to finish." I don't see how that's fair.

Some kids like me, use sports as an escape from you house, brothers are parents. It will be difficult to maintain a B average. You would be forcing children to spend time with there family not, and maybe they don't want to! Or for instance you have a child who need to learn teamwork and maybe is in need for some man to man or girl to girl time with he or she's friends.

Mrs. Principle don't pull this law over us sporty type of kids! We try to keep are grades up, I mean C average is still passing right? Well please don't so this to us, we can try to keep a B average but Well we have 7 classes. Don't do this to us.

You student,
