Hello my name is luke and I am here to invite all of you to join the Seagoing Cowboys Program. When I first joined the program I was so happy. It all started when my friend Don Reist invited me to a boat ride and I could certainly not say no. If you decide to join you will feel great after because you will have this feeling in you that brings joy after helping others. Of course it could be dangerous at sometimes because once on a rainy night I slipped and almost fell off board!

I was so happy I was still alive,the bad part was that I could'nt work for a couple of days because i cracked my ribs. Another reason to join the program is because you would feel amazing and after you help someone. Think about how they will look at you not as a stranger but as a friend or maybe even a hero. So that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Thank you for your time.
