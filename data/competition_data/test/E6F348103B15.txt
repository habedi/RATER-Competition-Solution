The "Face on Mars" was just a natural landform. The "Face on Mars" was described at first as a "Egyption Pharaoh", when really it resembled the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. If there were aliens who did make the monument, we would have not exposed this new information to the world, and have some scared, or excited about top secret information like this.

The natural landform must have been created by a shuttle landing,or has been here before we've known it. According to our team in NASA " The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle,or mesa", as I have said at the beginning, also if the landform were to be created by aliens there would have been some type of physical evidence that something, or someone would have/had been there before us.

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA explained " We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."

meaning, as soon as there was a shot so our supporters could make out, the picture was sent in to them. But because our supporters were not as satisfied of the picture, and thought they were gonna have some type of sy-fy picture to show them, they were sadly mistaken. They also have to realize and understand that information exposed to the world like that would not only put them in jepeordy,but us and our jobs too.
