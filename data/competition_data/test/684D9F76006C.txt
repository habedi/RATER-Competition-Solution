Dear Principal,

I think that requiring all students to do community service is a good idea. Litter has become a big issue in most schools. It would give students something else to do in their spare time. Also it would help people that volunteer to do community service, they would have less work to do. Instead of thinking of community service as a punishment think of it as being fun because you would do the community service of your choice.

There are many fun community service activities. For example there is tutoring children, cleaning up litter, volunteering at animal shelters, and many more. Tutoring children is fun community service because it gives you a sense of responsibility, you are teaching a child something to help them in life. Cleaning up litter is fun too. You can help clean up beaches or lakes and other places, so it looks better and the wildlife that live in the area won't be harmed by the trash. Volunteering at animal shelters is really fun as well. You care for injured animals, groom them, exercise them, and feed them. All of these sound really fun to me.

If you let the students pick their community service activity they're more likely they will do it without forcing them to. If they feel it takes time away from other things they're doing encourage them to find community service activities they would enjoy. Community service can be fun if you see it that way. It only becomes a negative experience if you don't enjoy it and if it doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment. Keep in mind that it not only helps the community, it helps themselves too by teaching them responsibility.
