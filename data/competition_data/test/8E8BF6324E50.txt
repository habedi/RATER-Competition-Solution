Hey im writing an explanatory to inform citizens about the advantages of limiting car use. It's an wonderful idea to depend on buses,walking, cab or taxes for one day. So that you can save engery because it's a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Since world war 2 our development has been depending on centered car and it need to change ,because people depends on having cars,and i've to say what about your health? When you relie on things like that you'll think you dont need to walk to where your going or you to fancy or high class to ride a bus or even ride in a cab. Then maybe the roads won't be so busy after all. Also which would help with our air pollution. So what do you say get up and lets get moving and have a car free day! what do you say? Cause I'll think it's an wonderful idea so you can get out and enjoy the air! Long been of the world's prime car cultures because America's love affair with its vehicles which makes transportation the second largest source of America's emissions just behind the power plants. This is why i wanted to inform everyone in the U.S to try at least have one full day when you dont use your car you catch a bus,cab or n train to make our life ,town and comminutie a better place.
