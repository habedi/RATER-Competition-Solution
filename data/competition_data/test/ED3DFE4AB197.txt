Dear Principal,

I think students should have to do community service if they act up in school or if they not do there homework. They should only have to do community service if they don't do there homework all the time. If they forget once they should be able to slide and get away with anything. Some kids fight in school, there the ones who should have to do a couple of hours of community service a day. I say that's the only they will learn. Also, they should have a volunteer stand thing set up, if they want to do it they can, but if not they don't have to if there one of the good kids out there. That would also take time out of school, so that would not be a good thing. The other kids would be in school why there out doing community service, or unless they have community service on the weekend. Then you could not be sure that everybody would show up. Everybody has to have there schooling you can't get anywhere with out all your schooling now a days. The state also makes you go to school a certain amount of days a year. I think community would be a good thing tough because people just toss there trash right out there car window. Also, the student could plants flowers and make everything look pretty.

Maybe community service would help kids grades also because there mind would be on objects relating to school. I say it would also keep kids safer. I say it would keep kids safer because they would nit be out parting with there friends, or gone out and trying drugs or little things like that. Community service would be a great thing if you asked me. Everybody else has different opinions than other people. I don't think the students that would have to do the community service would be to happy but it would be there fault for not doing the homework when it was due, or acting up. I think they should have a week to get there work in before they get put on the community service list. If they guess on there homework i say they should get there amount of community service doubled. Also, they should have a rule if they don't do there homework so many times, like if they have to do community service every week they should make them come and do it every weekend also. I say that because if they don't like doing there homework they mess up there plans by having community service then it wont hurt to mess up there weekend. There parents would not be to happy with them and the school for making them do that on the weekend but like I said it was all there fault, every bit of it. Also, they should have to go around to each house and ask the people that own the house if they need anything done. That's not meaning go out and talk to strangers. That would just be your punishment. I think community service would be a lot better than gone out and getting a fine, for something crazy. Everybody thinks differently than other people. That's what I say about community service.
