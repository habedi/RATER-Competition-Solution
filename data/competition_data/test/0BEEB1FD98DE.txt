I bleive that driverless cars should be developed because we are at a new age in time and we need to upgrade. To start upgrading the world lets strat with new technology in the cars that we drive.

In the world we live in today we drive ordinary cars that were made for ordinary people. Lest beging looking at the companies that are making the cars, are they great at manufacturing, is their reputation high, and are they expected to make the world a better place, Yes. Many futurists said that in order to have smarter cars we would have to have smart roads as well.

IN the 1950s, GM created an test track with an electric cable that sent radio signals to a recieverat the front of the car. Others have tried this, but they had a different mathod. Engineers at barkeley used magnets with alternating polarity, such as sensors. we ues sensors today to give human like senses to an object. I believe the number one reason for putting sensors on an car was to see if they could make a car drive as if a real human was in side controlling it.

If the car was always driving by itslef wouldn't the driver get very board and lose focus off while in traffic. Yes they would, which is why they have decided to put in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays for drivers that get distracted easily. These heads-up specialties are a great use of our technology because we have created them to help us with our new technology, we are a technology reliant community.
