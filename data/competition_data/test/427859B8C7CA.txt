I dont know what is out there but I know what is happining in my own back yard. There is no way the face on marse's surface was made by aleans because we have photographic images that prove so, and by telling it was made by alien it would just help us. So if you really think that that the alience made the face on mars then you don't know any of the facts.

First of all we have the picktures to prove it. So maybe the first one wasn't as clear becaus of the times, but the next one was ten times better. It doesn't sound like a lot but for what the first one looked like was like eating fake oreos to the real ones. But that was on a cloudy night and because it was you still don't belive it. So we went and took an other one (even thought it was hard sence we dont pass it very often). Nevertheless we got it in all of its NON alian glory. With the next picture we got in 2001 you have to belive us that it was a rock. It was 43 meters per pixel compared to the first that was 1.56. If you dont know what that means then let me just tell you it was way better.

Also why would we ruin a great oportunity like that. If we had said it was from alien we would have goten so much money. Imagen all the questions that would have been asked that we might have not have been able to answer on earth. People would start demanding their questions be answed and we would not be able to do it. So we ask for money we would get the best to make it posible for us to get to the red planet and boom we are on mars and we make an other small step.

So if you want to look stupid and belive that the aliens made a face on mars then do so, but the facts are that there is not one.

We have pictures and a want to go to mars that wont happen to prove it. And if after all that you dont belive me then writ your own paper convincing everyone it is a alian made Mount Rushmore and maybe NASA will Get to go to mars sitting on a rock.
