Should Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) be used to read student's emotions?

The real question is, do you want your teacher to know if your happy, sad, mad, fustrated, confused, or board?

To some, the answer is simply yes, the ones who want others to know what ther are feeling are mostlikly a socil-type person.

On the other hand, its a simple no, if you know somone is gauging your emotions, say you didn't want anyone to know your mad, angery, or sad, would you be afraed to make any exprestion at all, or even go to class.

Nowadays, being watched is a normal acurance, but not to the personal level as to your emotions or thoughts.

Many may ask, what good is it to know about how one is feeling, the answer is unclear.

In paragraph six, the artical tells how helpfull FACS could be to the classroom, but if students should learn anything about real life, its crucial for them to understand, you can't please everyone, as much as you try, you won't.

If you have walked into a elementery school in just the past year, you will notice some very different souroundings.

Some elementery schools have laptops for every student, which makes it easyer than ever for a teacher to make and publish an assinment.

As I personly wittnesed my siblings having homework over the weekend, and Fridays, both of which, I never had in elementer school.

To sum it all up, the more tecnolagy we have dosn't always mean it needs to be implamented in a classroom, just becase we can dosen't mean we should.

Not to mention, who will pay for such a system, our tax dollors?
