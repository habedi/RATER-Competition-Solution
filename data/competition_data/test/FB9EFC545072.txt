In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new technology called the "Facial Action Coding System" which enables computers to identify human emotions. In paragragh 1 it talks about why the Mona Lisa 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 6 percent fearful in Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, the Mona Lisa. In paragraph 1 it also talks about a new technology called the "Facial Action Coding System" that can read humans facial emotions made by Professor Thomas Huang. These are the things that the article talks about thoughout the passage.

The first thing I will talk about is the way students in a classroom can also read the emotions of other students. In the paragragh before paragragh 8 it says that, "They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one." I chose this sentence because it explains how students are able to read other students facial expressions. Another thing is in science class the students performed a lab expierment to see if they can read other students facial expressions. They were able to do this because in paragraph 8 it says that the muscles in your face are called orbicularis oculi.

The second thing is how Professor Thomas Huang managed to be able to create a new technology to read humans facial expresions. In paragragh three it says that," when a computer constructs a model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles." I chose this sentence because it explains how this new technology works.

The last thing that the article talks is how it can read the Mona Lisa's facial expressions. In paragraph one it says that," She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent digusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." I chose this sentence because it explains how this demonstration showed that this new technology can read humans facial expressions.

Finally in this article,"Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author describes how a new technology called the "Facial Action Coding System" which enables computers to be able to identify human emotions. The first thing that I talk about is that students in a science classroom performing a lab experiment were to read their partners facial expressions. The second thing that I talk about is how Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckam Institute for Advanced science was able create this new technology, none this be possible without his new technology the "Facial Action Coding System." Lastly none this would also be possible without the Mona Lisa's demonstration to read her facial expressions.
