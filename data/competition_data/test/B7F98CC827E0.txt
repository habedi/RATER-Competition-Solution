the use of this technology is valuble because students get bored in classes and sometimes mad at computers. this could help re-energize students and maybe even calm them down when their computer isnt working right.

students myself included become extremely bore when just looking at a screen and filling out some worksheet or project. but with this new technology the computer could change a lesson to make it more entertaining. making an online project or worksheet more enjoyable, and enhancing the students chances of getting a good grade. students also tend to get upset with their computers and other technology during school, and doing things like slamming the screen shut and hitting the keyboard. but the computer could detect that they are angry and open somekind of stress releiver like a video game or a desktop destroyer.

in conclusion this new technology would be very valuble and helpful for students and even people working at say a desk job.
