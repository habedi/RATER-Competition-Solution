Dear Mrs. Principal,

Cell phones should be allowed at school. Kids could be in an emergency and need to call for help. Kids can also use cell phones for getting a ride. Those are my reasons for cell phones being absolutely necessary in school.

I believe it is necessary for students to be able to use their phones at school. If they were not able to have phone at school then they could not be able to call for help if they are kidnapped. Kids could also need to call the cops and report that someone is being mugged or robbed. There could be someone with a gun at school getting ready to blow peoples brains out with a cell phone they could call the cops and have them save everyone. Kids could be separated from their group on a field trip and need to call to set up a place to regroup.

There are other reasons to like if their parents forgot to pick them up from school one day then they could call them and ask for a ride home. They could also call to let parents know they are going to a friends house after school so their parents could pick them up later. Kids could go on a field trip and need to get a ride home from someone who they know. Kids could need to tell someone their bus crashed, and there are a bunch of kids stuck on the side of the road who need rides home.

Cell phones are a part of everyday life why should they not be allowed at school. If people can use them at work why can't students use them at school? Cell phones are a part of life that are now a necessity to live in this modern world. Kids need them to Get ride to places and to use in an emergence. Cell phones must be allowed at school for the safety of the kids.
