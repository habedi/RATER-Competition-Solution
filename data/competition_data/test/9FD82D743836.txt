Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To keep our community green and fresh people volunteer to help clean, help around their neighborhood, and provide for the citizens of their community, neighborhood, etc.

Some students like myself, naturally give back to my neighborhood for what they have done for me.

Other students do not help, or clean up their community because they feel it takes to much time or is useless.

However, I find it very useful because of three main reasons.

Reason number one of students having to do community services is to give back to the community.

For example, our local grocery stores who provide us with food, malls who let us take a spree and go shopping, and schools who give us an education.

This places are a major role in our lives because we need food from the grocery store to live, malls to by clothes to cloth us, and an education to be successful and get far in life.

Example number two for students providing to the community and doing community services is to get kids up and out doing work, instead of up and out doing bad things in the street.

If a student is busy doing community service every once in a while or a couple times in a week, it keeps a burden off of the parents backs because they know their child is up to positive works.

Instead, he kids will not be in the street selling drugs or their bodies.

The last reason of why you should require kids to do community service is because it gives us kids a sense of how life as an adult can be.

For example, I needed to do twelve hours of community service for my Conformation.

Some of the hours, I spent tutoring kids in after school centers.

I helped with their homework, and got them to understand subjects that I once didn't might not have understand.

While doing this I somewhat understood how the job of a teacher feels. Off course I did not have to grade papers, but I did have to spend time trying to cope with student and get them to understand what they didn't understand before.

Other jobs as in picking up trash, and recycling can be connected to the hard labor of a garbage man.

It is not as hard, but it certainly requires the same maintenance.

Community service may not always be the happiest of things to do but it certainly needs to e done. If we start doing community service as were young, then we will grow up to be adults doing this.

And as adults we can help start organizations and other younger kids who would like to get involved with helping their communities.

Anything I can do to help my community that helped me, I would defiantly want to help.

That is why giving back to the community is something I will always cherish and want to do!
