Would you rather spend your summer doing something you design or someone else does? Some people think a teacher-designed project is the better because, its easier for the teachers to grade, but I believe that a student-designed project is better because, it leads to more impressive work from the students and gives them a summer to do something for school while fulfilling a passion they have.

First, studies show that when tasked with something that peaks your interest you care more about the final product. If students are able to design their own summer projects they will put more effort into said project. The more effort the students put in, the better the projects end results will be. If they're given a project they have no interest in they won't want to waste their summer completing it. Some may not even do it at all. Doing an assignment or project you do not want to do can be stressful and weigh on students.

Second, if the students get to design the project they can spend the summer doing something that is meaningful to them. No matter the age of the students, they all have something they are passionate about. Some students do not get the privilege to learn about that passion. With student-designed projects, the students get the opportunity to spend their summer learning about whatever it is that makes them happy. Perhaps a future career, or some type of art, maybe a part of history. Every student has a different passion and they should be able to spend their summer fulfilling it.

In conclusion, although some people may believe that teacher-designed summer projects are better. Student-designed projects are clearly the smart decision because, they can lead to a more impressive final product, and it is better for students to spend the summer learning about something they are truly passionate about learning.
