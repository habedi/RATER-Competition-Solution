In more recent human years, travel has grown and grown and grown, when taking a horse from one side of America to the other would have taken countless years in the past, now we get in our cars, hop on to US1 and drive for a few days and we are on the other side of the country. Cars have connected people all over the world, allowing them to reach loved ones, and friends and family easier then ever. Although with every good thing comes some bad. Cars run on gas, and whenÂ  they use the gas they cause pollution, that is slowly destroying the earth, second driving a car can encourage people not to walk and exercise since they can just push a pedal and go as fast as they need for as long as they need, finally running a car costs lots of money. Having to fix up the car and pay for gas to run the car, people without cars would have lots more money to spend on other nessesities like food and water.

But with todays technology it doesent really matter if you drive or not, cars are becoming more fuel efficient and even hybrid, the amount of benefits to negatives really does not balance out, being able to go anywhere or being 0.00000001% help for the environment, also driving cars creates jobs for people everywhere, designers, mechanics, gas station workers, etc. So although, yes not driving would help the environment, it would also cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs, crippling the environment and destroying america, a country that basically survives off car sales. When your wife is giving birth and it takes 30 mins to drive to the hospital, are you going to be happy that you sold your car to save the environment?
