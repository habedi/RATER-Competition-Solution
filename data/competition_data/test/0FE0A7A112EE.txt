The way that the author had wrote this is with facts that he has gained and compairing Venus to Earth and the type of environment it has and had.

Starting off the author had explained what is important to know about Venus in paragraph two. When the author explanins the atmosphere of the planet and the degrees it can reach there. As well as how harsh the environment can be with the earthquakes, heat, high pressure, volcanos and frequent lightning. This supports "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" because the author wants the readers to understand how hard it can be to explore somewhere like Venus. Then in paragraph four the author was explaing yes Venus has rocky sediment and once was covered in large water. It was a long time ago and probably isn't safe there anymore. The author continues on into paragraph five, explaining that it is a bad idea for NASA to send people to Venus with the harsh conditions. The author continues on in that save paragraph understandind that the air pressure is not safe nor the level of heat that Venus can reach. On the other hand in paragraph seven the author talks about how NASA is finding alternative wasy to exlpore Venus. Such as, having a drone orbit the plant for observation, some simplified electrons made of silicon carbide, and mechanical computers.

In conclusion the author supported the paragraph with the amount of evidence they had provided and as well as the way they grabbed their reader atteniom. They were writing for someone who had an idea of knowing more about venus and that is what they did.
