In Luke's point of view you have a opportunity of a lifetime to be in the

Seagoing Cowboy program. You have a opportunity of a lifetime because you get to experience adventures and visit many unique places . To be in the Seagoing Cowboys program you have to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas . One reason why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you can help the countries that were left in ruins when World War ll ended. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations have joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).The second reason why you should participate is because you also can find time to have when the animals have been unloaded. In conclusion you can participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program to help these countries that were left in ruins by the World War ll and it can also make you more aware of the people that are from other countries and there needs.
