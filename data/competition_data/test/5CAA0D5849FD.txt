In my opinion I say that the use of technology to read emotional experssion is uneccessasary because what if a student doesn't want a a teacher use a scanner to see what emotion thier in. Not only student but also adulsts might not like it either when they go to work and there boss trys to scan them and see what emotion thier in. I don't think anybody will like that idea of have that kinda technology. I'll say it will not be a good idea because what if the scanner is wrong not saying it is but what about after multiple tests on the scanner and its scans a person and the scanner says thier in that mood and if the person might not be in that moods the machine will probably be giving the wrong information.

I can say that I don't believe that techology can always be right and always be right because theres been problems with other stuff that they have invented like cars,phones,computers,laptops,and droms. Some stuff can maunfunction not everything that has been invented turn out great. That why I said a scanner that can read emotional experssion is kinda of a bad.

I don't think techology is ment for that purpose I don't think will like the idea. People don't want technology reading thier emotions its thier life nobody just can go up to them and start scanning thier face.
