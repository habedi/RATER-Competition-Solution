Since the increase in school attendance, homework, a form of continual, at-home learning, was created to eliminate forgotten knowledge and stimulate academic development outside of the classroom. Due to this, new forms of such medium have developed transpiring into what is now know as summer assignments. Although, there is still much debate centered around if such projects should be student or teacher designed. Although, a student designed summer assignment may be beneficiary to the student in terms of difficulty and creativity, in order to better actively promote proper continual education and prepare children for their upcoming course load, all summer projects should be based off of a teacher's model.

As humans are confronted with adversity, many choose the path of least difficulty. This trend of human nature can be seen dating back to the first man. Through evolution man was taught always to take the ladder of the two in order to insure survival; the modern interpretation of this instinctual thought would be classified as laziness. The average student, just like Chromagnum Man, will typically not go the extra mile if given the easier path; therefore, in order ensure proper brain stimulus and appropriateÂ student effort, a teacher-designed summer assignment is necessary.

In prepare students for the upcoming challenges and expectations regarding their course selection, students must be allowed to model expectations from a given, teacher-assigned, summer assignment. Children are taught on the principles of mimicking behavior. Therefore, by modeling expectations, students are allowed to prepare for their future courses through a natural monkey-see, monkey-do pattern. In order ensure proper learning, a appropriate model for a learning basis should be given to students to better prepare for the year to come.

Additionally, in order to better prepare for students' future academic course loads, teachers, as fellow advocates for education, should be inclined to facilitate proper thought processes in academics by the means of a carefully designed project. Examples of proper learning environments are already seen through the public schooling system, so inherently this should be expected at a must in order to stimulate the brain at home just as it has throughout the school year previously and to come. through this thought process is has become imperative that the modern child needs not only a active learning goal, but also a way in which to achieve it; that way comes in the form of a teacher-designed summer assignment.

As previously touched on, the thought of allowing for a creative, student-designed project is one that naturally comes to the mind of many students as well as teachers; though this thought process inevitably roots from laziness. As discussed prior, the student will always take the ladder of the route eventually reverting to a lazy state if improper precautions are taken; in actuality, facilitating such behavior.

Throughout this process of argument, it has become indicative that the matter in which thought is stimulated and perceived in consequential to the manner in which it is given. If given the option, most students will take the road most traveled as a natural reaction to adversity. Additionally, students must be prepared for proper course load through a guided thought process. In order to achieve a proper though process, a appropriate learning environment must be achieved at home through use of teacher modeling (a teacher-designed summer assignment). The allowance of free rain over projects under the fallacy of creativity spurs laziness over both student and educator as evident to human biology through evolution. With the facilitation of such student needs, the brain is allowed to prosper and continually develop intellectually to create yet another productive member of society.
