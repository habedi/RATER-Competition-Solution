Why Venus well it's simple "our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".

The author believes that Venus should be explored because they may be somthig on venus that leads to new innovations or it may very well just be the part that making it to Venus is the innovation. The author makes sure to list the dangers so that there won't be a basis veiw-point and that talks about ways that could work. Even though in the ways there are also flaws which are also pointed out but the author tries to make a point that evenn though we are right next to Venus we know very little and that Venus could have been like Earth in the past. The author tells the reader about how there features that are simlier to thoses on earth like mountains, valleys, craters and may have even had large oceans and could have supported many types of life forms.

While there are many dangers like " a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide" even though past that there are coulds that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere of Venus. Then there is the surface which avgerage temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit mean that even though it is farther from the sun than Mercury it is still hotter. Another thing the "atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater the what we experience on our own planet" mean that man can't even reach the surface of Venus. Even so "our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".
