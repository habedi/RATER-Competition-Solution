Ring!

The bell signals the end of school. You gather your assignment from your teacher, then rush out of the class to meet up with your friends. Laughter and chatter fills the crowded halls. Banners hang from the ceiling advertising the next school event, prom. You find your friends and on your way home, you all gossip about all the newest drama at your school. Yet another successful day of learning and socializing is done. School gives students this opportunity while online classes do not. While students have the opportunity to socialize and improve their education, online classes deprives them of that. Students should not be allowed to take classes online because it hinders their education, and doesn't teach them socialization nor proper discipline.

At school, students have the benefit of meeting with teachers to get additional help. It provides the students with a better understanding of the topic, and a convenient way to meet with teachers. Teachers constantly urge students to meet with them if a student needs help because it is a free and easy way to understand lessons better. Overall, being with the teacher and having the opportunity to meet with them individually improves the students education. However, online school does not give this option to students. Students have their session with the online class, and that's the end of the topic. Teachers cannot give extra help or meet with students one-on-one, which is valuable time students may need. It is a disadvantage to the students and does not give them a proper education.

Additionally, school provides students the opportunity to socialize with other students, as well as teachers and staff. Socialization with other students allows friendships to build, as well as develop important social cues. This is important for the development of kids and young adults into adults who can handle social situations. Furthermore, school gives students the opportunity to interact with adults, such as teachers and principals. This teaches students respect for those in authority positions and how to communicate with people in those positions. This interaction is important for interviews and other situations where they must work respectfully with adults. Online classes deprives students of this socialization. This creates lonely, and antisocial students who don't work well with others. These students taught online miss out on valuable life lessons such as making friends and working with adults. Students need school to allow them to build upon their social lives and learn how to behave in social situations.

Schools not only teach their students academics, but also proper discipline. Students are expected to be at school all day, at a specific time and give teachers their undivided attention. To do this everyday and all day takes discipline, something not required for online classes. Online classes generally take less time, are not every day and can be less work. They are easier. While a student might like that idea and structure of a class, it is not beneficial to them in the end. Discipline is a characteristic needed throughout life. It helps students in their future when they have jobs. Learning everyday on weekdays prepares them for working everyday on weekdays.

Students should go to school rather than taking online classes because school improves their education, allows students to socialize and teaches discipline. Online classes deprives students of valuable life lessons, while school builds character and prepares students for independent adult lives. While it may not be a students favorite place, school provides them with lessons, academic and more, that develops them into successful adults.
