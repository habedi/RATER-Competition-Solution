Dear Principle,

This is a very difficult choice for you to make. The first policy is what I think is the better option. Yes i understand that cell phones can be a distraction to students and teachers, but in the halls it would not distract anybody. I think that because students should be able to have cell phones to school. They should be aloud to have them during free times because they would not be a distraction to anybody because they have nothing to focus on well other than what they are doing. Students would be much happier in the halls if you allowed them to have cell phones.

Another reason would have to be if a student had to get a-hold of there parents because of an emergency, but were not able to have phones.

There are many kids with health problems. What if some kid had to take medicine and forgot to? There are many problems that could happen to a student and they would need to talk to their parents but were not able to get the help they needed. Yes you could get help from a teacher, but if it is something that a teacher did not know what to do, you could have a lot of problems there. So I hope that i have persuaded you enough to allow students to have cell phones during there free time at school. So as you can see, there are many reasons why a student should be able to have cell phones.
