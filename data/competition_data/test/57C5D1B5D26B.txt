What if out of the nowhere a person had to go out of their way to do something that wasn't needed? Wouldn't they be outraged and confused being forced into something that they know isn't necessary? So if this was implemented on a full scale of students wouldn't it fall apart completely. Knowing that the rule that would force students to do extracurricular activities could end up hurting the children and damaging the school, shouldn't it go away.

A school should support helping kids make their own decisions, but if they force them to make one it only hurts them and their growth. When someone constantly holds your hand and guides you to a choice it isn't possible to grow and learn. If they choose to hold their students hands throughout their schooling, how will they be able to grow and progress. If the children are forced into certain activities they won't be able to learn for themselves and become dependent on others. This can be shown in some schools were students pay others to write essay's for them but then fail their tests because nobody could help them. Also, it could ruin several students ability to manage their time if the principal forces them toward a activity. If a student who has a busy life gets more pressure on them they may give up on their grades. If they aren't able to manage their time on top of the activity, they won't be able to excel like how schools wants the students to. An example of this can be seen anywhere because if too much pressure is put on anyone they can get anxiety or depression from the stress. Lastly, it gives more stress on certain students because of the unfamiliar environment. If a child who is bad at interacting with others is forced to spend an upwards of 30 minutes or more a day alone with others it could make them anxious and scared. It would throw students into an unfamiliar place where they don't know anyone and don't even like the activity. This is shown in things like graduation or going to a new school, because teenagers may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the changes in environment. With all the damage the new rule would cause why let it stay in the education system.

It would change the school in many bad ways if this rule was allowed, which is why it can't be allowed to exist in our education. If the rule stays more money will have to go to clubs and activities then usually resulting in lower funds. A decrease in funds will happen since they need to buy more equipment for all clubs like volleyball. With more funds going to clubs it will be harder to improve the building itself and if any damage happens it may not be fixable. Which, is shown in modern capitalism where in order to expand you need to spend more money. Next, it will affect support given to the school. This will happen because if their kids are made to do something that affects them mentally in a bad way their parents will outrage. They would start losing students because the parents wouldn't support the school. This can be shown with things like the corona virus where people started to leave their countries after learning it was unsafe for their families. Last of all, it could affect the sponsors they get. This would happen because the school could start losing parents and kids which would affect how much money they get from sponsors and parents. Sponsors would leave because they no longer think that the school is worth their money since they are losing children and their parents. This can be shown in the stock market, where when funds are in a certain business and the value is going down the sponsors sell their stocks and leave. This would overall permanently damage the school if these events happened, which shows that this policy needs to be rid of.

It is only a waste to make that policy because it ends up hurting the kids and the school. There is no point in keeping this rule if it is just going to hurt everyone around it. So, if this school really cares about itself and its students it should let this activity law be abolished.
