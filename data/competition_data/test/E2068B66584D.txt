Luke's point of view convincing others to participate in the Seagoing Comboys program is that it helped people and animals. It made Luke more aware of people in other countries and their needs. He was grateful for the opportunity. It opened up the world to him. The awareness stayed with him. His family was able to take care of a number of exchange visitors and international students for many years. The Seagoing Cowboys program recovered food supplies. Luke knew that if he joined it would change his life soon afterwards, and he knew that it would be a huge oppportunity of a lifetime to him. The Seagoing Cowboys helped take care of the animals that were sent overseas. He knew that alot of countries were destroyed and ruined from World War ll so, he wanted to help. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a good expierence for Luke and he liked how he got to help many animals and people.
