Dear. Principal

Community service is a good thing to do but some kids like the watch other people clean up after them. For example you are with a bunch of your friends and you drop a candy bar rapper and you see it there on the ground but you don't pick it up and put it in the trash. The right thing you should of done was to pick it up and put it in the trash. Some people like to do community service because it makes them feel good and it helps other people in the presses. Kids think it takes to much time out of spending time with there friends. But what if you got a bunch of your friends together and started picking up around your community together. I think community service should be optional, because if it was required it would take to much time out of sports and other after school activities. But i also think students should be required to perform community service around the school during school hours, because if students did that the schools campus would be a much better place to play sports on and hang out on. I don't thing community service takes to much time, if i see a piece of paper on the ground i pick it up and pit it in the trash.
