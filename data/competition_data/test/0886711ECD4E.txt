if you have a job or you are a very busy person, having an extracurricular activity as a requirement for your school can be a hassle. You should be able to do whatever you want outside of school. And may not take an interest in anything the school has to offer.

When school ends for the day, you should be able do have time to yourself. Sure you have homework that you need to do, but time spent at home is nice. It's nice to get away from school and your teachers, and just have alone time. That is, if you get any alone time after school.

This isn't a problem in elementary and middle school, but in highschool you will probably have a job at some point. And having to do school, homework, and your job can be stressful. And you may not have the time or the energy to be in an extracurricular activity. And maybe some people cant make a comittment to a club or sport if they know they wouldn't be there most of the time.

Nothing in your school may spark your interest, there aren't any clubs that you would like to join, and you aren't a big sports person. There is a club out there for you but it may not be at your school. Sure you can apply to get a club made, but how often does that actually happen? You have to get enough people to join and a person to chaperone. Whereas, the internet is full of a bunch of online communities that have the same interests as you and can connect with you more than people at your shool who dont have the same interests.

You shouldn't have an extracurricular activity as a requirement for your school, many people are busy, don't have anything that interests them, or just want to have alone time after school. Sure you can have clubs and sports, but I think people shouldn't have to join against their will. They should be able to do what they want to do outside of school, whether that be sitting at home or playing a sport or being in a club. It should be their choice, not the principal's.
