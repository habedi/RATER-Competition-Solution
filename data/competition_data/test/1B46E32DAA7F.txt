Imagine a school that makes every kid do community service. They are cleaning messes that isnt theirs. They shouldn't be cleaning messes outside. They should be home cleaning their own messes. Parents are not going to agree with this. They are going to argue with the board of education and make it a bigger deal then it already is.

You have to think about the kids safety. They can get hurt while they are cleaning outside or even inside. But outside if they are cleaning anything can happen. Theirs wild animals, wild people, cars, trucks, anything can happen to any of those kids. And who are the parents going to put the blame on.... the school. The kids are the schools responsibility, they have to watch what they do and where they go. These are things the school can avoid from being sued or getting the principals fired.

If kids have health issues like, allergies, or get heat strokes easily, or anything. Any little thing the kids are allergic to can be very hazardous to them. They can get seriously ill, or even past away. The principal doesn't think about these harmful things that can happen any second. He has to think before he makes any changes in to the school. He can put himself or even everyone into great danger from even one shabby move. Every ones life would be at risk.

The kids behavior issue might be bad. Kids can sometimes get on your nerves.

So of course your going to want them to behave the way you want them to behave. You wont want them hitting each other or fighting. You want them to behave like normal kids should behave. You have to repeat your self to them twice or three times. You say behave once and they will settle down. You don't want any kids getting hurt while they are under your surveillance. Cause if that happens their is a chance you would get fired. So keep that in mind if watch in under aged children.

There for the principal shouldn't allow kids to attend community service if they havent done anything wrong or choose not took. Its not your decision its the childrens and parents decision. Yo
