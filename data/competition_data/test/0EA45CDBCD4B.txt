Hello there, my name is Luke Bomberger. I have been part of the Seagoing Cowboys for five years. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times, and the Pacific Ocean twice, all through the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Here is a little information on this wonderful program. The Seagoing Coyboys is an exquisit program that has allowed me to experience wonderful adventures and visit many swell and unique places. Now I asume that you are reading this because you would like to know what the Seagoing Cowboys promgram is or would like to participate in it. If you would like to know what it is or how to join, just keep on reading. The Seagoing Cowbows program is a program that allows you to help the people that have been affected by World War II. Have you been affected by that war? Do you know somebody who has been affected by that war? How did you or they feel? I am going to asume that you (or they) were not the happiest person then, but if you would like to make someone as happy as they ever will be, join the Seagoing Cowboys today!
