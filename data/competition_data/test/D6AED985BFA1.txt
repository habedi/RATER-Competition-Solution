Dear Principal,

I believe that community service is very important, and is a major part of our town. I think it is a great way to teach teens and young adults learn what it means to help out and make them feel better about doing something for their communities. Many teens these days loaf around home texting and wasting their time checking on who likes their status on Facebook. It would be a good way to get them to help out and make a difference.

I think that doing something good and having a positive feeling about it is an addiction. For me, helping and elder cross the street or teaching a child how to do math would make me feel better than sitting around and virtually communicating with friends. Community service is a great way to get people of all ages to help out around town and learn what it means to live in a place where help is always needed. An old friend of mine, who had a disease where, over time, would deteriorate the strength of muscles all over the body, gave me an example of how hard it was, even as an eighth-grader, to stand up or even to walk. Think of all the ways middle schoolers could help people with diseases or illnesses.

Once, my youth group at church went to a nursing home and sang to the elderly people. It made my day afterwards because I knew that when I get older, I would appreciate something like that. Like I said, doing something good is an addiction, and it makes you want to feel it again. From that day forward, I have enjoyed and even sought-out the chance to do something good. If the whole school of young and capable teens could feel that, and get the want to feel it again, I think that our town would benefit from it.

I agree totally of your choice to make it necessary for teens to do community service, and I hope that I can do something to help out as well.

I hope that in the future our community will be a better place and will invite people from all over the nation to see how just a few people can make a big difference.

Sincerely,
