Should these summer projects be teacher - designed or student - designed? The projects should be student - deigned because the student can feel more comfortable while doing their work, students can come up with their own ideas, and it can be grades based off the students ability an feedback.

First off, I feel like the student who has to do the project during there break should be able to pick their own project so they can feel more comfortable because, what if the student doesn't have the right technology to complete the project by the deadline. The student may also be in a different environment to be able to compose of the teacher designed project. While the student is composing of the project the teacher could help give them feedback so the students wouldn't mess up.

Meanwhile, The students should be able to come up with their own ideas because sometimes is better for a student to be able to brainstorm some ideas so they can write them down on a piece of paper because its time when the teacher can't come up with as many ideas as students can. For example i student can have a project dealing with music or the different types of music i believe a young student can come right off the top of their head with a lot of them while the teacher can't.

Afterward, It can be graded based on the students abilities to come up with the project. The teacher can help by giving the students some feedback to help the student think harder so they can get a better grade. Feedback such as make sure you are looking up the information in the right location because the internet can give you false information such as wiki because people can make an account and change some of the information an then the student gets a bad grade because of what someone else did.

Inconclusion, I believe that if students are required to do projects during summer breaks it should be student designed not teacher designed because it can also be mistakes in both of them but, most likely it will be more in the teacher designed projects. I feel like students shouldn't even do work during the summer.
