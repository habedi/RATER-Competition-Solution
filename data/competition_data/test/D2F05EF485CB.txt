In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars", there is information showing that the Face is a natural landform, and was not created by aliens. I have to agree, and say that the Face is a natural landform. Reasons to back up my thought would include, that the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures showing that it wasn't a real face, they have never seen anything like this before, and more scientists believed it was a rock formation rather than an alien.

The Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures to get closer looks on the formation, to see if it could be a real face or not. In paragraph 7 it stated, "...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." Malin and his team took sharper pictures to prove to other people that they were right about it being a natural landform. Scientists also haven't seen anything like this before. In paragraph 9 it mentioned, "We just donÂ’t pass over the Face very often." If it really was an alien you would see more things like this because there wouldn't be just one alien, there would way more, causing there to be more faces. More scientists also believed that the Face was a natural landform, while only a few believed it could have been an alien feature. Within paragraph 8 it stated, "But not everyone was satisfied... Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." By the article saying this, they showed that some people disagreed with the other scientists, and actually thought it was some sort of alien marking.

Although, most of the scientists say that this is a natural landform, there will always be someone who wants to disagree with them. No matter how many people would say that something is right, there will always be that one person who has to be different then everyone else. In the article, there are more facts saying that the rock is a natural landform, even though that leading it to be bias. There would be a better argument, if you had one story saying it was natural, and one story saying it's because of an alien.
