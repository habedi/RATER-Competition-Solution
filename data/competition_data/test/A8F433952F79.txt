Dear Principle,

An issue concerning community service has come up and is in debate. I am writing this letter concerning this issue. My opinion is that students should be required to do community service.

Community service is a great way to build good character and learn how to appreciate the things you already have. When helping other people and seeing how bad there situation is compared to yours you begin to be grateful for what you have in life instead of becoming jealous and vain of other people. It builds good character by giving kids the sense of accomplishment, happiness, and pride of helping others and making there lives better. Community service would make students better in the class room and teach them how to be great respectful people.

If your school begins the requiring of community service it will spread to other schools. There now would be more and more people helping out there community's making the world a better place in a sense. More people would be humbled and a new hope of a better life and neighborhood restored in peoples hearts. Just imagine this whole country helping each other making the best of life instead of putting people down, out on the streets and starving with a family to feed.

I'm aware that some of your students do not support this movement to require community service. I grantee that after there first service project they will fall in love with the idea. You just have to give them the chance to be apart of it. All it takes is a couple hours of service and it can impact a persons life like you can never believe. Also by enforcing this your school would become a better place for students to learn with a decrease in bad behavior by students and trouble makers.

I encourage you to make community service apart of your school. I hope this letter can let you understand how awesome this experience would be. By making a small change like this you will change many young students lives and impact your community in a positive way. I strongly support the idea of students being required to do community service.
