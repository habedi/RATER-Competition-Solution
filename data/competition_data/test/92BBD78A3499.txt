This leads me to my next topic which is sociability. Clubs bring people with the same intrests together. This will bring oppertunitys to build friendships with new people. Working with other people will soon build up leadership skills. Having leadership skills will become very handy if a person chooses to become a boss. Having these skills will stay in a persons daily life.
