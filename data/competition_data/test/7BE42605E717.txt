Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

The student body has been made aware of the possibility of a new policy of the participation in sports and other activities. We understand that the policy states that students who do not have at least a grade B average may not participate in sports and other activities. The students of this school do not agree with this statement. We understand your concern for our futures and that you want the best for us but, the fact is many students have a grade C average in the school. We would like to propose possibilities of the new policy that would agree with both you and the student body.

Physical Education and activity is necessary for a teen at this time in their lives. They should get the most physical activity that they can get. Obesity is also a problem in our school and we feel the policy will disrupt our ability to fight the problem because, we want our students to grow with confidence . We should also talk about other activities that would not be possible for a student to participate in, if they have below B average, as your new policy states. There are many activities that can help a student receive scholarships and grow in learning. There are also programs that can help them in their daily life. We offer knitting, woodshop, Home Economics, and many other activities.

These programs can help kids stay in school. By providing a possibilities to learn in many of their interests, they can be content in other subjects which may not be very interesting to them. It would also help kids spend more time in school and out of the streets, where they run the risk of drug abuse, pre-marital sex, alcoholism, and other horrors of the society we live in today.

In addition, to our reasons we would like to propose that you change the policy to people below with a C average. It would be greatly appreciated. We would like to thank you for your concern for our academic lives. It show that you care; God Bless You.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME, Student Council President
