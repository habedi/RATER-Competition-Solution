Chaos on Venus? Venus is one the hottest planets in our solar system and the most dangerous planet to explore. The author beleives that trying to explore Venus isn't worth it despite all the dangers in presents. Venus isn't safe for humans to explore. Our mechines wouldn't be much help to explore Venus. Even if we get humans close to Venus, they would still to get close enough to take simples.

Venus isn't safe for humans. Venus is to hot for humans to vist and is constantly expericencing natural dangers. In paragraph 3 it states that," Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earth quakes, and frequent lightning strkes to probes seeking on its surface." This shows that Venus is safe for humans.

Our mechines wouldn't be much help againist the dangers of Venus. Because of the atmosphere pressure, most thing would just get destroyed or crushed. In the paragraph 3 it states that,"the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet .These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." The proves that our mechines wouldn't be much help.

Even if we can get humans to Venus safey, they would still have to get close to surface to takes samples and there are risk to getting closer to surface. In paragraph 6 it states that," However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most form of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard froms of photography and videography ineffective. more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a through miss to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk." These are all good example as to why visting Venus would be worthless and how humans would have to get close enough to Venus to take some type of sample.

In conclusion, visting isn't safe for humans. Mechines would be much help exploring Venus. Even if humans got to Venus it wouldn't make a difference to the risk and dangers of being on Venus. There for studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
