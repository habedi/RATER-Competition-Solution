Many students tend to forget or struggle when their teachers assign them with projects over the summer.Â Students should design their own projects because teachers don't know what students do over the summer and students want to have fun and want to enjoy it more than having to still do school work. This lets students create a project that will allow them to manage how much time they can set into doing school work and have more time enjoying their break. Letting students choose helps them by setting it at a level that they can work at without struggle and make it easier for them.

Students creating a student-designed project will allow them to manage time better with what they can work on during the summer and have more time enjoying their break. Most students like to travel over the break and sometimes they can't do it abroad and don't have much time when they come back. For example: "I went to El Salvador with my father and he lives in the country side, in his house he doesn't have wifi but does have cable. Coming back I only had five days to do it before I had to go back to middle school." Students wouldn't be able to do any school work because they could probably not have internet access and want to enjoy their time visiting.

Students can design their project and making it easier by doing: a summary over a couple of simple novels, do a short essay over a easy and simple prompt, do research over patterns in nature like, looking at moon patterns for two weeks or observe temperatures for a period amount of time and do a study on it when they come back. For example: " I had a simple project to recorded what the moon looked like at night, every night for a week and draw it. This was easy and simple for me to do and i still learned a lot from it from observing that the moon slowly phases through each night through its cycle." Even doing small simple projects, students can still learn and discover new things because they don't have to stress about it and its something most students should be able to do.

Someone might say, Teachers select projects that they think is good for students and it's better for a teacher to have control over it because they know their students best, expects them to do their best, accomplish it and that challenging them is good so they don't forget what they learned; however, that's not the case, really what teachers don't know sometimes, and what makes students have a hard time or take a long time on projects is that, teachers want to assign projects to what they think their students can do and put them at a challenging level or a process that takes a long time but students want to have it simple over the summer has they don't have class with other students and don't meet their teachers anymore so they can't ask for help. Students don't need to stress out over the summer by what their teachers assign, letting students decide lets them be creative and discover with what they chose to do.

In conclusion, Student-designed projects, will encourage and help students with work and still learn from it as the teacher wanted for them to learn in the students own creative way.
