Dear Principle,

I heard that you were reconsidering the cell phone policy and I have some reasons that I would like to share with you why I think you should pick the first policy. I think that you should pick the first policy because us teens love having our cell phones with us all the time, and if you let us use our cell phones at lunch and other free times its pretty much a treat. The reason I say its like a treat is because when were in class a lot of people text and most of the time they get caught but if you give us the opportunity to use them in free time there will probably be less kids getting there phones taken away and less distractions.

I think that you shouldn't pick policy two because if you tell students not to bring there phone to school, were going to do it anyways. There will probably be more distractions in class such as ring tones going off, text message alerts going off, and people calling. Another reason I believe you shouldn't pick policy two is because what if a students parents need there child to have there cell phone so just in case something after school happens. Like they're going to be at the store when you get home so use your key to get in or even emergency things like if a family member is in the hospital so don't ride the bus we'll pick you up from school. These are the reasons that I believe you should pick policy one because it would keep the students happy and the school staff happy.
