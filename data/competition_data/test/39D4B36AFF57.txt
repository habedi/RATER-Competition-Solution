There are many reasons citizens should limit there car use and help our planet. First off in the first text I read someone says when they got rid of there car it reduced some of the tenseness they had and they felt happier. Also the cities who used less vehicles wouldnt feel as tight and over whelming.

In the second text i read it gave me many statistics on how using less cars would help us. One thing they stated was they banned certain vehicle license plates for a couple days and the smog percenatge went down as low as 60 percent. Also car pooling or hybrid cars were fine because it helped the cause of less smog.

In the third source I read through it helped me understand the importance of not using your car often. They banned car usage that day besides buses and taxis which is hard to follow through especially on a rainy day so many people got finned. In the text they said its a goo dopportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. After hearing about this many other cities started joining in on the movement to help reduce pollution, which they did do. Also the park centers and pitted sidewalks have imporved tremendously.

During the last article I read it really opened my mind to riding bikes, walking or even car pooling. It talks about since the market crashed people didnt have enough money to buy cars and pay for gas. This made me think how much money you could save if you stopped driving. You could do so many other things without paying for a car and its gas money.

So overall I think we should reduce our driving because we could reduce pollution, save money and if it has to come to it you can car pool with a group of people.
