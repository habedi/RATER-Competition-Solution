Could this be a total fail? Should we be able to let schools use this device? Could the machine be a waist of time? Should the info provided by the machine lead to somting bigger than just emotions? This divce could either help people or desroy people in its own way: or it could also be a complete fail.

The use of this device in class rooms would be great in a way;so the teachers could see whats going on with one of there students. On a total other note not every one can express there feelings through facial expresions; even some people tend to portray others emotional states wich leads to imataion. So personally I would not want to have this at my school. For there will be a complete disaster (people can always fake ).

In the text the writer was talking about "empathy (the feeling of someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate other persons facial expreions'(found in paragraph 9).Another example from the text would be we dont neccacerly need a machine to predict others emotuions. In the text it stated that to an expert faces dont lie ;that muscles are a clue .Also that a false smile can be predicted by the facial mucles: in the text it stated that "the mouth is stretched side ways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risourius".

In conclusion the machine would not be valuable in a class room. There are many other things to focus on/in class that using the machine would be a complete waist of time. A way students could be checked on instead is by communicting with them or directing them in the correct direction.
