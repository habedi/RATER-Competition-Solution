Dear principal,

I do not think you should force us to do community service because we have things to do after schools. I also think that you already take to much time from us. Finally community service is for people that did something bad and diserve a consequence.

I have soccer practice and band I do not have time to clean up what other people through out there window because of time problems. My soccer team is not the best but I want to practice so that we can. I also have a band concert coming up and need to go over my music. Plus home work witch adds up and determines weather you pass or stay in the same grade I don't know about you but I am not failing because I did charity work. I think you should put more trash cans and spread the word. I don't want to give up my life for cleanses that will soon be dirty.

I think you already take to much time away from us I mean realy 8 hours and we wake up early in the morning. You also think we should do about 2 hours of charity work! Lets see I get home at 5:00 homework and study time takes me about 2 hours plus the 2 hours of charity work that would be 9:00 I also need to eat ,practice and play around. I want too watch the television and play X-box 360. I don't think this will work right.

I also think it is a consequence for what you did wrong.
