Dear principal well i do not think that this is fair because some students cannot get that much of a high grade as other students. So i think that this idea is a waste of time because there would not be that much people joining the sports and other activities because as i said before that not everyone can get a average grade of B and higher. Even now since most kids are struggling about school now a days. So i am against this argument and i think that they should not do this because as i had said before not everyone will be able to a tend these activities. So if you ask me not everyone is able to get a grade B average. And what if the student is mentally challenged then it would be even harder to get up to a B average grade.

This is why i do not support this idea on having the grade a B average to a tend sports and other activities. Even though doing this may give kids now a days to get that extra boost to try and get higher grades. It also may not give kids the boost as well. You see kids who have low self esteem will just give up because they do not think that they will be able to make it up to a B average to a tend sports and other activities.

This is why i do not support this idea that the principal is doing because as i had said before in the first paragraph and second that not everybody will have the chance to a tend these activities because of the struggle some students are having in school. And i also think that this would be unfair to those students who cannot reach to a grade B average.
