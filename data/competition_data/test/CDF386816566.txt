Dear Principal,

Deciding whether or not to change the school policy will be difficult for you I'm sure. I am a student athlete, obviously you would expect me to ask you to keep the policy the same. But, I know changing the policy and making everyone strive and try to make a B average would be a good choice. On the other hand ,some athletes like myself are actually trying to get good or at least average grades. Sometimes a C average is the best we can do for that quarter or semester. After working out , practicing multiple sports each season, games ,traveling, giving the school a good sport reputation, then trying to fit in homework when we're dead tired is hard for most of us. Wouldn't it be hard for you ,too?

Schoolwork to some students is easy . For those students who get a 4.0, 4.2, or 4.5 are using this time as an eighth grader to get ahead of everyone in freshman year. Then, you have some students who have the average grades or the B and C grades, most likely they won't do so well in high school, meaning they get no kind of academic scholarships for college. But, if the same person that had those low B and C grades was great in sports ,they have a chance to get to college or even just have a good high school athletic career. Changing the policy can mess with their futures. Now, is a crucial time for that athlete with the so-so grades to get ahead in his/her athletics, just like the student with the 4.2 GPA is preparing himself for high school.

In conclusion, please keep the policy as it is. Let those athletes have a chance for greatness, changing that policy would be harder than you think on us. I hope I could have influenced your choice even a little, or helped you understand the daily life of a student athlete. Thank you for your time.

Your student ,
