To the principal:

I have heard that you are thinking about having all the kids in your school to do service around the community.

Some people have disagreed with this idea, but I think it's great. It would help kids learn not to be selfish and learn how to help others, but those are not the only reasons why.

First of all, it help kids get involved with good things.

For instance, many kids might go to a community building like a mall, and do nothing helpful to others.

But if they, for instance, joined a recycling committee, they would not only help others, but care for the environment.

What good will come out of going to the mall? As well as this, many kids on a regular basis go home and play video games for hours or watch TV.

Community service would be a good opportunity to expand their horizons and learn how to not only be social, but teach them that they're not the only person in the world.

Second, the community would be better if many kids did service.

I know that a large number of elementary schools need volunteers, but there isn't many because so many of the kids' parents work.

Community service could offer a good after- school job for a teenager, as well as helping the teachers have more students understanding the topic, which could improve learning.

As well as this, the volunteers could actually enjoy the experience, and might want to become a teacher.

I know it's just a thought, but you never know.

Lastly, kids could benefit if they did this.

People would praise them for volunteering, and who doesn't want to get complimented.

Community service could also help future job opportunities because it would add so much to your resume.

Think about it, nothing bad will come out of the service, so it should be enforced.

Community service is most definitely not something that's a hard thing to do, so kids should not be whining about benefiting thirty- minutes of their time.

I think this opportunity would be good for students, so no matter what people think, students should have to provide community service.

Sincerely,
