When you hear Venus from someone mouth what comes to mind? Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is like the closest planet to Earth when we talking about the density and size.

The author supports the claim of challenge of exploring Venus by point out the cons in it and but how they still challenging themseleves. Sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus and bcause of this sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. But the main thing is that as they sent spacecraft to Venus, non of them survived the landing for more than a few hours. But when you join venus to a ship orbiting far above the planet it can provide a few insight on the ground. " Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anthing else, from a distance." This bascily talking about how people we are observing the Venus can't see anything from there is experiment. However, the scientists are looking for a machine that will last long enogh to contribute to the knowledge of Venus.

In conlcusion, Venus is dangerous but can be challenged. Spacecraft who has practipate in this challenge and was not able to survived need to be credit because the things is very tuff. Also for other spacecraft there is more work to do and do different experiment before attempting to go for that challenge.
