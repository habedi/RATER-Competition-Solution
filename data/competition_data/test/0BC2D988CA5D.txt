Dear Principal,

I think students should be allowed to have cell phones on during free time because if there parents call them and it is an emergency then they need to be able to answer it as soon as posible. I also believe that they should be able to have their cell phones on during free time because that's the only time they get to do something fun or talk to one another even when they are away from each other. Next,i believe that we should have cell phones on when we have free time is because if you don't have anyone to talk to during free time then you can call some one that you do know on your cell phone. Others may go against it but it really don't matter because everyone has there own opinion. Finally,the reason we should be able to have our cell phones on is because some students don't just want to be stuck at school talking to the same friends over again. Those are my opinions about students being able to have there cell phones on during free time.

Sincerely,STUDENT_NAME
