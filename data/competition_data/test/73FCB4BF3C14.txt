TEACHER_NAME,

All of us know that you are making a very important decision about making students do community work, or letting them do whatever they want on their free time.

This is a very hard decision and should be taken seriously.

Many students would love to create carefully thought out community gardens, but others would just despise it, and play video games, so you must take all consideration of what goes on in an ordinary students day.

Most students love to be outdoors and play sports.

Sports keep kids busy and away from doing drugs, or any other illegal activity.

If you use sports to create some community service project, how many kids would do it?

Lots of kids would because they would be doing something they love, not to mention keeping them busy and energetic.

The students that play sports could teach sports skills, help with throwing, foul shots, batting, running, almost anything!

Imagine yourself walking around, supervising this group of workers, and seeing all the smiles on their faces, from helping others out.

When you see a smile because of helping, it's a one of a kind thing.

If you had the people that would be taught the skills pay five dollars for two hours, you could donate the money to our local soup kitchen, or give it to people who have recently lost their homes.

Then imagine, seeing the smiles of those in the soup kitchen thanking you for what you have done.

It creates this wonderful feeling in the pit of you stomach.

If one small activity could do this, what could a whole school of students do?

That is a question of your own to answer.

You can only find out if you decide to take charge and have students doing community service.

Community service could be a wonderful thing for the students, and could encourage them to do more.

Just one little step, could leave a giant footprint, on the foundation of our community.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
