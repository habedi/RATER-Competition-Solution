Do you want to be a seagoing cowboy? I was once, and I think that the experience is very fun-filled and educational. You will meet many different types of people on your journey. Does it sound fun? Well, here are some reasons that you should decide to become a seagoing cowboy.

First off, you will find that there is always something to do on board the ship, I found that there are many things to do so you can pass time. I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed on return trips after the animals were unloaded. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games were some of the activities that we did.

Also, when you are off the ship and you need something to do, you can explore the surrounding area. On my trips, I toured an excavated castle, saw the Acopolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are many things to see and do anywhere you are.

Lasty, you always know that the things that you do help many people in many ways. I always loved seeing the smiling faces of the people that I gave my time and energy into helping them. The people that we helped were survivors of World War II. Their belongings were destroyed, and most of their countries were left in ruins. We gave them food supplies, animals, and more.

So, do you want to be a seagoing cowboy now? If you do, thats great! The experience lets you remember that what you did changed peoples lives forever. If I had the chance to become a seagoing cowboy again, I would take it. This made me more aware of what life was like for other people.
