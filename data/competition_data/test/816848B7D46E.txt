In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports this idea very well by explaing different aspects of Venus that make it highly worth studying. when the author explains why we should explore Venus one of the statements that i was most intrigued by was was when the author stated that "long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth", the reason i think this is a very good reason on why we should explore venus is because it could help give us a better understanding of our universe, mabye human like creatures lived on venus at one time, maybe there were buildings on venus, the possibilities are endless. This is why i think that the author makes a great claim about exploring venus and why i think we should further explore venus.
