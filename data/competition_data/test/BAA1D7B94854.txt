Dear, principal

I believe that you should not change the school policy. My views on the subject is that the policy stay the same. Not only has the policy been the same for several years but, some students are not the brightest in some subjects and many students could barely even hold up a C average. Many of the students at this school are looking forward to scholarships in the sports and other activities they are in. In most cases students not only love what they are doing but, also like the teachers who help them out. I understand where you are coming from and i get it all you want to do is help them more and succeed. Of coarse you want to see your students do well, i know that i would love to see my friends have good test scores and high grades, who wouldn't? Well all i am saying is that you please take my thoughts into consideration sincerely, your student STUDENT_NAME
