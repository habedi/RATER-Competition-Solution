Although, Venus holds some dangers for astronomers, it is a great science of study and has potential solutions to avoid dangerous studying. It sparks scientists to Venus, due to the similarities it has to Earth, as is to why scientists are interested on reserching this planet in space. The conditions are far more extreme than anything scientists encounter on Earth due to the stability of the atmospheric pressure and temperature that could crush practically anything. Venus is worthy to pursuit because in paragraph four, it reads, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This explains to the reader to why it is important to be discovered despite all of the challenges on the surface.

"Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." (paragraph 8) Despite everything that makes us humans limited to encounter the curiosity of Venus, it shall not be intimidating to expand the edges of knowledege when humans can work around it to find safe solutions. Paragraph seven explains, "NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of VenusÂ’s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." This explains to the reader that they are still interested in the findings of Venus because they are experimenting ways to finding safe solutions that convinces the reader that the idea of studying Venus is still a worthy pursuit.

The idea of expanding scientists knowledge of Venus are risky, this does not make it impossible to find stratagies to make studies safe for the scientists. It may take many experiments and knowlege to make it easier for further visits, but it is never limited. The wonders of a planet so similar to the planet for humans will carry on depsite the dangers of it. It is worthy of pursuit because the idea of studying it is never impossible and scienetists shall never give up on their ponders of their fascination on Venus.
