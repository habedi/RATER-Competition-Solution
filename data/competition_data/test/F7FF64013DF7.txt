Wow, school has came a long way!

There are now a variety of schools; to name a few, boarding, driving, military, nursing, cosmetology, etc.

You name it they most likely have it!

You can say education has had its evolution.

Yet, one very controversial way of learning is online.

Many parents and educators are on edge about allowing their students to attend an online school.

Although many feel there is nothing to worry about when it comes to online school, here are a few things that may change your mind about taking these online courses.

School builds your skills, most of the websites online are huge scams, and being at school is, for the most part, a fun time!

Students deserve to be able to enjoy these years!

This is why students would not benefit from being able to work from home.

For one, being in school helps students with growing their skills.

Our skills are what makes us, us.

Without these skill-building assignments, students would not know how to do everyday things; for example, class presentations help students with their public speaking skills.

Many of the assignments students do in class are helping them grow as a person.

Speaking with classmates helps with their communication and people skills.

Having rules and school staff helps students build their much needed skill, active listening.

Without attending school filled with other individuals, students would not have the skills that are needed in the real world today.

To conclude, attending school is extremely efficient because it helps students build their skills.

Secondly, one key reason why attending school is the better option is because of scams.

Online can be a scary place.

There was an incident that happened in 2016, where a mother had found her 16 year old daughter on video call with what she was told was her "online tutor", except it was an registered sex offender.

One morning, the 16 year old girl told her mother that he was asking inappropriate questions, so her mother caught him in the act on camera and showed it to the police.

The mother was shocked because all of this happened on a website that claimed to be 100% safe.

Many parents dread allowing their children to have online school is because of this.

That just goes to show how dangerous it is to attend online courses.

Most of these websites give out false information to dumb students down which does nothing but waste the parents money.

In conclusion, online school is not the best option because of the scams they have to offer.

Others may say, students would benefit from being able to work online because students would not have to worry about the distractions like relationships, detention or suspension, or they would not have to deal with more serious issues like bullying.

Despite these reasons, home-schooling is not as beneficial because students will be missing out on a good time!

School has many fun activities you can attend.

Prom is a big one.

At school students won't just be working, they also are able to play sports, cheer, join clubs, etc.

Being home-schooled won't allow students to have the creativity or fun, as they would if they were in school.

To conclude, students should attend normal school over online for these reasons, school helps grow students skills, most of the websites online are scams, and being at school is, for the most part, a great time!

Studies have shown that 73.4% of students who attend a normal school over online grow up to be very successful!

So why not just have your children in a normal school?

Overall it's free!
