there are many advantages of limiting car use the most important is for our health. by limiting car use we decrease the gas emissions ,also make the stores closer to you than across a huge highway,another reason is that it reducies smog build up many places are doing this for the health or maybe they just cant afford it .

many places in the world are starting to ban cars places like paris,colombia, and germany. in some places its be couse of the cost in vauban, germany it cost up to 40,000 for a car space and a house so many people just have a house not a carman y peolpe like it like this they say it takes stress away. this also helps with gas  emissons in europe. in europe up to 12 percent of gas emissions  are resposeable by cars and up to 50 in gas emissons.

many peole also like this becuase it makes the stores closer to the poeple since not many people have cars they cant travle far so stores start setting up close and nearby. this also makes more space fore sidewalks and houses insted of stores. this aslo helps with your health beause it incuages iyou to wal kmor insted of taking a car every where.

in places like paris car have really effected the population there are so many peolple that it creates smog so what the peole did was they gave fines out to people that were driving on days they couldnt this brought 4,000 drivers to get fines 31$ and 27 to get ther car impounded. by stoping and lowering the amount of drivers they brouht congestion down by 60 percent and made the smog subside in bogota colombia they have got three straight years without cars there goal was to promote other means of transpotation. by doing this peole have made up to 118 miles of bike pathe and many parks for the public.

these are some but not all the ways that puttin limitations on cars could benifit us by redising smog and the green house gases bing released in to the air and by making stores more accesibale to peole with out cars and making a impact on our health.
