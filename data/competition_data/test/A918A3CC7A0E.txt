I don't think that the principal has the right to just change the grade from a ''c'' to a ''b'' so you can play a sport. Due to the fact the a athlete do not have the time to study and play a sport. Between practice and games leave no time for study. The only extra time is study hall and even that might not be a suffice the needs to complete all the work that needs to be done.

If the rules are changed then there will be only a very small group will be able to play. That small group will more than likely will not be able all of that sports duties. The c students that could be terrific players will not play, so scouts from collage will not see the athletes play. that would make them unlikely to get a scholarship to collage.

maybe your just trying to push them to be smarter,but taking away what the love isn't go to push them just make them angry . Instead you could give them an incentive,like when they win a game or make it to state throw them a pep rall
