Have you ever been forced to do something you dont want to do? Well that is what the principal of our school is doing right now. I disagree with what the principal said about every student participating in extracurricular activities because it could effect student'sÂ homework, family time, also it isnt fun for some students.

Students normally do there homework after school, or after they get done hanging out or playing games after school. With activities being after school, and homework being done after school, there wont be as much time as they normally have to finish it. Normally schools ends at 2:15, and after school activities end around 5, so doing after school would give students 3+ hours to do homework. If someone has to eat in that time, do chores, and maybe even play a few games, the person would not have a lot of time to do there homework. Thus there grade could drop from not doing there homework, or not having enough time to do there homework.

Some families do stuff with each other when every member is at home and ready to go. If a student stays after and leaves around 5 they still have to either walk, ride a bus, or get picked up to go home. With this being the time families would be having dinner, and with the time they won't be able to go out after eating because it is bad to run around on a full stomach. Also with the time they might not be able to go out to eat either because, for me, it takes a while to get to the restaurant and then you have to decide what to eat. When it is the weekdays, from my knowledge, restaurants close from 6-8 pm and even then there time there will be shortened because they also have to eat before the restaurant closes then go home.

Lots of students hang out with there friends, or go home and start playing video games after school. Although, with after school activities they would have less time to play video games or hang out. Students can still hang out after school, even if that is correct some students don't do the same activities as there friends, or they just focused more on the activity. Focusing on the activity is the main things students have to do, if they goof around too much then they would get in trouble. Also some students don't like any of the after school activities, they aren't fun to them, which is why they dont do after school.

Homework. family time, and fun, those are the reasons I disagree with having students do after school activities. Of course it could hep them, by making them for social, it could be teaching them things, and it could be a workout for them. However, I don't want to be forced to do something and I doubt anyone want to be forced to do something.
