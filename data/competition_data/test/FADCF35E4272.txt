Exploring Venus is so important that scientests thought of ways to complete that mission safely.

Lastly, the author states, "Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth... Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel" (4).
