The "face on Mars" isnt even a real face, it's an illution. I know that because of thhe article. The article has some interesting things to say. Including that it's not a real human or any of that nonsense. I know that for a fact and here are some reasons that it's not a face.

First, over the years the face hasn't stayed looking the same and you can see that by looking at the pictures in the article. Mars isn't still it has winds and winter and summer. As said in paragraph ten, "a cloudless summer day in Cydonia." So, Mars is going to have land differences. Just like we have tectonic plates moving, winds, earthquakes, etc. That changes the surface of the land. So, Mars has the same.

Just like Earth's surface is changing everyday so is Mars.

Then, you can't just look at Mars and see the face immediatly. You have to be standing at the perfect angle. It says in paragraph 7, "And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." Not only did the camera take a better featured picure but they also had to be at a specific angel. As said in paragraph 10, "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view." You have to be in a specific angle to see the "face." Just like when things look funny in a specific angle. Like how Italy looks like a boot to some people. So, it wasnt alien made it just has to do with the land moving or wind moving the dust into making it look like a face.

Finally, this has nothing to do with aliens or an ancient civilization doing it. It's just natural landform. Wind probably made this or the change in land but no ancient civilization. NASA only wanted Mars to get a little attention and to show people the wanders of the plant.
