Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Requiring students to perform community service is an excellent idea. Children these days take life for granted; they live very selfishly, with no concern for anyone else. Community service is a great way to give back and feel good about your self. Just by giving an hour of your time to help out children at day-care, or to serve food at a shelter, can really make a difference. Students should be required to perform a certain number of community service hours because its a great learning experience in how to work with others and also, its an excellent way to give back to the community which does so much for you everyday. Community service is where we can just give a little to make a big difference.

With school taking up most of the day, and then children sticking themselves inside the rest of the evening with homework and such, they really don't have much time to interact with people. Community service is a great way to teach us how to get along and work with others. We don't get jobs until we're 16, so until then we only spend time with people we know. Whether you're helping out at a nursing home or daycare center, you get to meet new people. We don't always get along with everyone we meet, but this is an opportunity to learn how to act in public when we are working and frustrated. Performing community service hours is a great experience to make new friends and teach you how to work with different people.

Thinking of our teachers, and coaches, and everyone other person who works in our town, we realize how many people work so hard just for us. Their jobs aren't easy, however, that doesn't stop them for being the utmost polite and helpful towards us. Simple things like staying an hour or so to help clean up the room after playtime at a daycare, or organizing mail for the patients at a nursing home can really help someone out. It really feels great when you're working so hard and someone goes out of their way to help you. Its a great way to give back to those who have done so much for us. It doesn't have to be a lot of time, just an hour or so, and we can really make a difference in our community.

TEACHER_NAME, community service hours really should be an added requirement for passing. Community service is a great way to teach students life lessons that they will only experience other wise when they are adults. We can make friends with people we've never known before. We can help out those who have always helped us out. Colleges love to see those students who take an extra step to give back, rather than those who just sit back and enjoy everything that has been given to them. Its such an easy thing to do, that really won't take as much time as we think it might. We never know until we try it, we may end up really liking it!
