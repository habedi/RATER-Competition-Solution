Dear Principal,

I believe it is the best for all of the students out there if you were to allow cell phones in school. However, I believe that the rules should be very strict regarding the punishment for cell phone use during class. That is disrespectful to the school and the teacher. Teachers and staff should be aware of this as well. If they were to catch anyone with a cell phone out during the times they are not allowed to, they should be ready to report him/her to the principal.

Cell phones play a major role in adults' and teenagers' lives. If you were to take them entirely away from campus, some teens would go ballistic. Several teenagers depend on cell phones for emergencies regarding a sick family member, reports on a pregnant mother or sister, or another probable event that may be happening to them and their family.

However, you may wish to ban them completely, and it is not my job to control whatever you say in this matter. You are the principal and it is your job to work out these decisions and solutions.

Yet, I still have an opinion and feel that I should have a say in whatever may happen. This country's laws say that I have the right to do so. All citizens have the right to protest and the right of speech, and I will take advantage of those rights at this time. I hope I can make a difference in one or more of those teenagers' lives that believe they have to have a cell phone.

My hope is to have put a student's opinion in your mind permanently, and that you will keep it in mind as you make your conclusion about our school's policy on cell phone use. I leave this message with you as a reminder that students care and will fight for their rights to keep their certain belongings with them at all times. However, I do believe that students should not use them during class because it is disrespectful, but they should be able to use them freely at the right time.

From, a student that cares.
