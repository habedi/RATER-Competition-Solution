Dear Principal:

I think students should bring their phones to class because students do like to use there cell phones after school and they might need to get up with their parents. If students use them at lunch and other free times, then you wouldn't have much texting in class. Students need their cell phones because they have to call their parents at time and the office doesn't let you use their phone all the time. When they get their phones at lunch and other free time then they would be able to do things a little better. Yes they do need to be off during class, but the teacher can check right before they start class. If they use it during lunch, then that is when some people may have to call there parents to make sure if they are riding the bus or being picked up from school. A lot of kids deal with things at home so they talk to friends by texting them so they don't get in trouble by talking. If they told them at lunch it would be kinda hard because it is always loud in there and you can never here the people talking to you. If they don't take their cell pones to school, then they wont be able to get up with the person they need to get up with. Only then they would be stuck at school and a school faculty member would have to take them home. Then their parents would be very worried about them and then they would get in big, big, big trouble. Before I got my cell phone, I would always have to use somebody else's to call my mom to come get me. That's why we do need to take our cellular phone to school with us. As I end my letter here, I would just like to say, thank you very much for reading my letter to you about cellular phone usage. I really and honestly do appreciate it very much. I am very glad that you took time out of your busy schedule to read mine and some of my classmates letters.

Thank you very much,
