Studying Venus, Huh? I agree, but it'll be too dangerous and very risky. But before that lets learn about Venus and whats its about. Tune in to find out!

In the article it states, "Venus, sometimes called the "Evening Star," is one of the brightest planets in the night sky, making it simple to catch in the night. In our solar system, Venus is right next to our sun. Venus is ovbisouly simple to see, but very hard to study it. Venus is called the Earth's twin, becuase of their size and density, density meaning how big and large it is. Venus goes at different speeds then the other planets."

Now that you know somethings about Venus according to my sources, lets get into it if you should study it or not. Personally based on what I read, I would agree to study it up close. But, it'll be very dangerous. NASA is going to have to do a lot of work to get job done. It's not going to be easy, you can't just go up there and expect to study a large, massive planet. A lot of stuff goes into doing these type of things. Venus according to the article, "Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Beyond high pressure and heat." So, you can't just go up there with just any type of vehicle, spaceship, etc your going to have to do some serious moding... just an insane type of transpotportation to go up there.

In the article it sates, "NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus." They've tested some models an they actually worked. They just need to do little to a lot more work and the job will be done. To me, I feel like NASA can do it, I mean what can't they do. They think the impossible and create the impossible. Whoever are the people going up there... make it happen!

Therefore, I know it's a tough task, but I know they can do it. I mean, like I said, what can't NASA do. They think the impossible then do the impossible.
