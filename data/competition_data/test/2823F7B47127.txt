Have you ever wondered if doing class work from home benefits the students? Yes, students would be able to benefit from doing class work from home. I have some strong and good reasons on why it benefits them. These reasons have been said by many people in the past that have done it as they listed; they are more focused, more time with family, more sleep, and you can do it at any point of the day.

First, more students say they feel more focused at home then what they would've been in school. For example, they say that there is no distraction to keep them from completeing their work and turning it in. Especaily, when its something important that would help them graduate from their classes. In fact, they have better thoughts of what they are going to do for their class work. Even though, when they have important family that they don't get to see as offten they would be able to spend more time with them.

As a result, students that do their class work from home have had a greater portion of passing then being in school. Thus, students have been able to work better when they have gotten a full night or resting. In other words, students have proven to be more active and awake when they wake up at there own time. Lastly, students don't worry about having to rush through the material and turning it in on time.

In conclusion, do students really benfit attending school from home? Students do benefit more when they are attending school from home. More importantly, they can focus more on the work given, as well have more time with their family, they can get plenty of sleep to do be able to do their work, and they can do their work when they feel they are ready to complete it in the day.
