You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because the program will open up your world. You get to visit very unique places. It's some work caring for the animals like having to fed them two or three times a day. But these are just some of the reasons why you should join the Seaoing Cowboys.

Some of the reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys are, the places you can go such as China. The seagoing Cowboys also went to Venice, Italy, " a city of streets a water. " Is what a member Luke said. Also when you go your not just working with the animals, when you have free time so you can have fun. You can do some games such as baseball and volleyball games in empty holes where animals had been housed. You can also have Table-tennis tournaments, or do, boxing, reading, and whittling.

My last reason is that you get an opportunity to be aware of what the people in other countries need.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because, you can go to new places across the world. You also can learn more about the world and the people living in it, and last, you can have some fun while you're with the Seagoing Cowboys.
