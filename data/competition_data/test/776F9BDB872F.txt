Dear, state senator i strongly feel that we should elect our presedent of the United states by popular vote in the artical it says that in 2000 when Gore had more poplular votes than Bush. Yet fewer electoial votes and still lost the campain. also in the artical it says that one person was agreeing that the electoral college is unfair, out dated and also irrational. i feel more people would agree with me because popular vote is probably the easiest way to elect a president although it has its bad thing like it can possibly be a tie and then it'll take much longer to elect a president. then you will have to go to congress. In the artical it says that one person was saying that the electorial college was unfair and also says that seventeen states didnt get to see the canidates. And twenty five didnt even get to see a campain ad. In my oppinion this was pointless for the voters to vote because if one canidate gets more votes than the other he automaticly gets it all, plus in the text, it says that some of the canidates dont go to the small places because they go to where they know there is more people so that they will get a easy win and if they win they get it all. so does that mean that other voters who lived in the other small states voted with out knowing who they voted for? therefor, that is why i agree that they should count popular votes because this way itll be fair for everyone and they could know who there voting for and everyones vote will count.
