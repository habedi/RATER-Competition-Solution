When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project.

A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself.

When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing.

School can stress a lot of children out. Making them continue doing work can add on to their stress if it is something they feel incapable of doing. Giving students the choice of designing their project can give them the benefit of the doubt, because the project is still what the school wants but just at the rate of what the student can do. Stress should not be something a school wants their students to have.

Summer break is the time for students to enjoy themselves. Students should at least have the choice on how their project is designed. All year the teachers had a say on what their work would consist of. The students should have a project they could enjoy doing, and not feel forced to do a project they would have a hard time on. If they have to have a project it should be something they do not stress over, but something they are confident in doing.
