Dear Mr. Principal,

I would like to let you know how I feel about your community service project.

I think helping the community is a great idea.

I would most certainly join in on this project.

I agree that you should require all students to participate in this project.

To me this isn't about what I want its about what I can do for the community.

I would do anything anyone wanted me to do.

I could take out trash for an elder who couldn't get around very well or even walk dogs from the Humane society.

Students could do a lot for people in this community.

If some of the students didn't agree with you maybe they could help the community likes once or twice a week.

I don't agree that they should have to do it everyday unless they wanted to.

They need time to perform extra curricular activities and have time to do their school work.

Doing this project may help the promotion of Global Warning.

If we go and pick up trash along the beach or not putting pollution into the air, it will help the community a lot.

We can also do community service going to and elders house and helping them do something that they cant do anymore.

For example, we could help them clean the inside of there house.

Maybe they can't reach what is nasty.

We could fix up there yard.

Like trimming the bushes around their house or cutting the trees.

We could clean out the gutters from birds who have made nests in there.

They might think that it will be boring.

But i can promise them it will NOT be boring.

You will laugh and have fun, and even get a connection to the people you are helping.

I agree with you one-hundred percent!

You should make everyone do community service.

It will not only help the people you are helping, but yourself too.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
