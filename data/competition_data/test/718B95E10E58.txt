I am against on the value of using this technology to read student emotional expressions. why? because if a computer can read a students facial expressions then the computer can mostlikley see them and that means no personal space for the students. "While it shows just how much this computer can do, imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. I also choose to disagree on not having this techonlogy becuase if the computer can tell your facial expressions then when you get bored in class then the computer can see that and get you off topic while in class, astudent can become easily distracted and tooken to another site . "A Classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"Dr. Huang predics."Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective himan instructor."The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Therefore I chossed no for many resonings and with them I stay the same, having this kind of technology is good to have but not helpful at all in classrooms.
