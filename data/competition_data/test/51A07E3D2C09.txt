In Making Mona Lisa Smile, there are really great points toward technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. In the first paragraph it talks about the start of the computer program. In the last sentence of paragraph 1, it states "Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comminicate." In this case the communication is showing the computer how you feel and the computer doing something to change.

This new technology of being able to tell how you are feeling on the computer is called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). There are 6 classified emtions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear and sadness- and you can tell all of this with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. There are different facial expressions that you can tell if a smile is fake or not. In your real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at cheek bone) lift the corners of your mouth. The other muscles is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus and that makes the corw's- feet around your eyes. If it is a fake smile, the mouth is streched out sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. You can easily tell how anyone is feeling just by looking at their facial expressions.

I believe that you could use FACS to help with a lot of things. For examples, when a kid is broed at shcool or they are falling asleep in class, the computer will sence that and change up what is going on to the computer to make them stay focused or interseted longer. You can simply tell how one of your friends are feeling just by the look on their face or their facial expressions and sometimes you don't really know whats wrong you can just feel it. Now that they have came up with FACS you don't really have to worry about the expressions because sooner or later it will come out of them about what is wrong.
