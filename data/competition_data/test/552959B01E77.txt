My claim towards this topic on whether or not to use this computer technology in a classroom would be effective or not. In my opinion yes, im all for this technology in a classroom. Mainly because i know as a student i do get bored and i do get tired when im reading an article and if this technology can read our facial recognition and change the lesson based on how us as students are feeling on the scale of facial recongnition. This article states that the computers in schools now wouldnt be able to handle this sort of technology, so what my main question is. How much would it cost schools to get a hold of this kind of technology and especially this amount of technology. When schools globaly are already asking the government for more money as a whole alot of schools have already asked for over 5 referendums in less than 4 years, in that case how could schools afford 3,000 computers with this technology inside it.

If we were to switch to this facial recognition software why couldnt us students jut all be homecshooled by a computer beause as Dr. Huang states " Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" so why would we need a(n) human intructor if this technology can act as a human instructor and change lesson plans according to how we are feeling based on facial expressions. In conclusion all i would like to say is that yes this technology could be very effective in schools in the future if schools had the mony to buy all this technololgy. An even bigger point I would like to make is why have school, if this technology can act as a human instructor?
