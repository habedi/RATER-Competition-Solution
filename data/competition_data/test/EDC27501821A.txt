Over 85 percent of high school students do extracurricular activities without being told to do so. I would disagree with the idea of forcing someone to do school activities because the student should know what is good for them by themselves, and making someone do it for you could never help. When a school chooses that you need to do something you lose the idea that when your done with school you should still do that sport or club.

There are many clubs or sports that you can do in a school but still there are less or more depending where you go but there is always quite enough activities. The chances of not going to a certain activity are high and there is not a lot you can do about it. If there is a point where there are no more places left or just to little choices that you like the school would force you to do something you dont like, giving no use to do that activity. There are many outside clubs or sports from the community that people can join and many students do. The school could never know if you were to join or not, because they dont know what happens in your life which brings me to my next point.

Time management is something many people need to build or are still working on it but no one is ever done because things keep coming into you life. The school does not always know how many test you have to study for, or how your house is being rebuilt after something broke or anything small that can still affect someones life a lot. Those reasons are just few of the things that can surprisingly affect a lot of people and then too still have to put more work to do an activity is outrageous.

Making someone do something never seems to work for me my mom always told me to clean my room and I would do so but needed to make a fuss and fight about it for no reason. Now that I have grown a little older I do clean my room with no one telling because cleaning my room is no problem, but if my mom were to say I have to clean my room I would think of it as a crime against humanity, having no point and having it become a fight for no reason. The same idea can come to this argument that making something do it is worse than doing it yourself.

For a school to make a you do a activity is not fare and should not be done and doing so can harm the student in the future in many ways like time management, doing sports on your own without being told, or affecting there academics. Most students would already do a sport that they would like but not make it in because there are to many people, than this rule would force him to do a activity they would not like to do giving no point to do it anyway.
