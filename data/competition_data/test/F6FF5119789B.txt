Your principal has decided that all student must participate in or at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree with this? I agree with the principal because kids need to get out and make new friends, learn how to work with others and do better in school.

One reason, to make friends can help you because you will see life in there or a different way. You can learn new things about them. Let's say you guys are playing basketball an one of the boys did a lay up, you can teach or show them a different type of move they can do in basketball like how to shoot when you are 6ft away from the net and not miss. It can help prove your low self stream and help you become brave or bold because you know that your friends will have your back. There was this one thing when my school sister(friend) cyan had my back when there was people picking on me about my shoes in 7th grade she told them to leave me alone and you are so mean and rude. From that day on we are still the best of friends/ school sister.

For an example, you can learn how to work with others. Learn from other people can teach you new things.

Like cooking someone can show you or teach you they recipes and you can do the same. A lot of people have a different ways of see things like in photographer you have one way of seem one thing and someone else can see a another way, but if you can put or come together with both ideas you guys can both make a amazing picture. Work together mean there will have to be teamwork like everyone has a job to do to get the work done and they can feel like the are part of this team.

Finally, do better in school. Extracurricular activity can help you in school because some of this activity you will need to have good grades in your classes in order to be there. I know in basketball and cheer you can't get in trouble like get in fight, suspicion and get bad grades. Yes it must seem a lot of work but it not, but real it's a lot of fun. Your attitude will be much better and so will your attendance.

At lastly, make new friends, learn how to work with others, and do better in school. Your principal has decided that all student must participate in or at least one extracurricular activity. I belive that by do this we can make the world a better place. WARNING: You will have lots of fun.
