"The car of tomorow", " The future in automotive is here". We have all heard and or read these these sales slogans before. Wether in medicine,computers, or even cars; the technology of today is shaping tomorow. Of thoes changes the most profund one is the change in cars. So are they worth it?

The use of driverless cars is a wonderful idea. They offer a special saftey that wasn't their before. If you hate driving threw big citys or even at night driverless cars are the way to go. They offer an economic advantage as they " would use half the fuel of todays taxis.", as Google cofounder Sergey Brin states.

As we notice all the good in a driverless car we tend not to notice the bad. the disadvatages to the driverless car are many. Many people see this driverless idea as a good thing but how many of thoes people will be able to afford this new technology? As with all new technology it's going to be expensive to buy, and it could also be expensive to replace and have fixed. Manufacturers will also tend to look more at the profet and diveate from the qualty of their products. This problem can be the bigest that stops the cars from being released. As qualty goes down parts will tend to break. When a part breaks the coustmer will go to have it fixed or replaced, but this can be an issue. Since it is a new technology not alot of people will know how to replace a certian part that is broken. That means that Their will be a backup of cars needing to be fixed.

Another problem is in a driving senerio. What if your driving and another car with a person driving runs the stop light? The driverless car would'nt know to look right of left, it would just drive straight threw the intersection. If that was a human driving they would know to wait a second or to before driving off from the green light. This little detal can hurt or harm alot of people.

A flase advertisement could also harm alot of people after buying a driverless car. As the artical states the human interaction in driverless cars is needed. Some cars even "notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill". That means that the car isn't allways self driving. As we saw in the case of the lady who put her RV in auto steer, took a nap, then the RV wrecked, false atvertisement is a crutial part of the cars sucess. Many people who buy a driverless car if they can afford one probally think it's all automated and will sleep or play around in the car. They could also not wear seat belts as these cars are advertised as safer than tratitional cars. The artical states that " the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."

Theirfore after facts and opinions are stated a driverless car isn't worth it. Yes, it is true that it can save the enviroment a little but you have to think whats more inportant your life or the enviroment. As people strech the truth about these cars other people will start to buy them causing allot of suffering on thier part. Never the less people will make their own choices regardless of facts or opinions.
