In "Making Mona Lisa smile" the author describes a new technology that is called Facial Action Coding System. The Facial Action Coding System is a system that can cacualte your emotions. The technology should be valuable in a students classroom for a couple reasons. One reason is because if a lesson is to boring then it could chnage it up to where you are having fun but still learning. Another reason to why the Facial Action Coding System should be valuable is because sometimes we have to pretend like we are fine when we aren't.

The Facial Action Coding System is a system that can caulate your emotions. Wouldn't it be couls if you could caculate your emotions like a math test? I think it would. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" it tells us how you feel according to the face expression you do. For example, in the article its says when you raise your eyebrows it means you are surprised. The article also says when you force a smile or if you actually mean it.

When you fake smile your mouth is stretched sideways. When you actually want to smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth.

The Facial Action Coding System should be valuable in a students classroom because if you are trying to pay attention but it's to boring the computer will detect that and it could change it to where you are having fun but still learning. Another reason to why it could be helpful is because if you are becoming confused about the lesson or have a question about it the computer will also detect that and it could offer you extra help. Wouldn't it be nice to get extra help when you need it? I sure would like it.

Having the Facial Action Coding System could help when letting your feelings out. There are some people that have to pretend like everything is fine and pretend they are happy when they aren't. Like it was said in the article people often can tell how you feel with the face expression you have but they don't kmow if you are faking it.

People see you look happy so they never ask "how are you doing?" "Can I help you with anything?" so you have no one to talk to but with the new system it would be different.

There are other reasons to why the Facial Action Coding System should be valuable I just said a coulpe. I think the new system would really help out alot of people and not only in school but also outside of school also.
