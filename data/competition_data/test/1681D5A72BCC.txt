The face here at NASA is not created by aliens. Here at NASA Mars Global Survey spacecraft we have revealed that the Face on Mars for what it reallys is: A mesa.

Just like said in praragraph 7 " On april 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the original Viking photos". Here at NASA we have sent a lot of our people out to take pictures to prove others wrong that this Face wasn't created by aliens. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the imagee appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform". After all there was no alien monument! People then told us that the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. We had already proved to everyone that aliens hadn't created the Face.

At NASA we had proven that the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is landforms common around the American West. After all there wasn't any aliens who created the picture and we proved that it was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all!
