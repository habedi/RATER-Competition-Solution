I support policy one because most teachers say school is so posed to be a fun way of learning. The principle should let the students use their phones but only at lunch and free times like policy one said. It sounds like a good idea but if a teacher takes away the cell phone during a class then the student should have to pay to get it back. The students should be glad if the principle allows policy one, because they get to at least use their phone without getting it taken away and having to pay for it. Also like for me instance I would rather have policy one because we get to use our phones at school in stead of not getting to use it at all for like seven hours. I enjoy school and so should other people but if we get to use our phones at lunch and at free times school should be a little more fun.

Policy one is the best policy for the middle schools and the high schools. Because like I said earlier school is and should be a fun way of learning. Also what if something happens at the school like at lunch if someone falls down and gets hurt and there's no one to contact their parents then policy one is the best policy for that situation. Policy two is just making schools boring like you should get use your cell phones at least at lunch because lunch is so posed to be a free time but if you can't use your cell phones then lunch isn't really fun. I mean like you have all your friends at lunch but sometimes your friends could get annoying like some of my are fun to talk to but sometimes they just like messing around with other people like just dising on other people. What if something happens to one of your family members and you can't use your cell then that's when policy one comes in and your family member was in a car crash or something then you won't get in trouble for using your phone at lunch because lunch is like a little break from school.

That's my opinion about policy one. Because policy one is the best policy for schools. Not only will the kids be happy but principle will be happy because the students. So that what I think about policy one and why schools should use policy one. Because like again school is so posed to be fun not boring.
