Dear Principal,

I don't mean to be rude or anything like that but I would have to say i am against you only letting kids that have up to a B play sports.

I am against it because there are so many kids that like to play sports but have grades under a B.

Kids in school like to play sports because they enjoy it and they have fun.

There are kids in school that would like to play sports but they have really bad grades.

You should let them play because maybe after school when the get home they don't do anything.

Just sit and watch TV, eat, and sleep.

They are not exercising their bodies.

They need to be healthy in order to have a good life.

you should also let them because can stay in after school sports instead of going out to the streets and do bad things that can really hurt them and other people.

They can stay after school having fun and they are still going to stay with their friends who also join sports.

Sometimes kids are going through really though times at home maybe.

And their grades keep on dropping down because at home they cant concentrate.

Majority of kids like to play sports but they have really bad grades.

We want you to let kids play the sports they want without teachers having to ask them what their grades are.

They will feel bad if teachers tell them they cant be on the team because they have bad grades.

And they can only get in if they bust up their grades.

We need kids to exercise so they wont be over weight and it wont cause them any health problems now or when they grow up to be healthy adults.

Kids promise you if you let them be on a sport they will try their best to make their grades better.

They will also like you more even maybe love you and thank you for letting them play on any kind of favorite sport they choose to play in.

i appreciate you taking the time to read this letter.

And i hope you reconsider that idea of yours.

Thank you.
