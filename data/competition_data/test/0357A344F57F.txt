Now a days everyone wants to start driving and be all grown up. But they don't know what their doing to their country. There are some people that don't even use a car any more. For example,"when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. She doesn't need a car to take her place so why do we have to use cars ourselves. Theirs always that person that say "no we do needs car there they've changed". We shoudln't have cars unless its neccessary to have one if your just gunna be in the house all day.

To begin with, one reason way we should limit the car usage is because its better for the environment. For example, "after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. This just means that everyone had to cut down on using there cars everyday. There's so many things you can do that good the earth not just recycling. Instead of using gas for your car use diesel fuel or even cooking oil. They dont pollate the earth as much as you think would.

Secondly, another reason why they should limit car usage because there's so much out there that you can do without having to driving anywhere."Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city." There are organized summer jobs and social life around where people walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends. You away go running with your friends or meet them are the park.

In conclusion, you can see there are many ways that you can change the world.
