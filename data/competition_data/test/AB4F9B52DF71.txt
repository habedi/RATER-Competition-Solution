Bring cell phones to school is not a good idea. Students are already bring their cell phone to school and they don't need to. Students get caught texting in class all the time. Cell phones are a major distraction. Do not allow this.

Many students get their cell phone took almost everyday. Teacher be trying to teach their lesson but they can't because students are using their cell phone in the middle of class. This idea is bad because when students need to be learning something they are not. This shouldn't even be a thought because you should know even if you do allow this and they are suppose to turn them off during class, they are not going to. This wouldn't be fair to the teachers or the students because the students aren't learning anything and they teachers are not do their jods=

Students are distracted by almost everything. Most students don't even listen to the teacher and them bring their cell phones wont be any better. they can find many things to do during lunch and their free time other than text or call people during school. If they wont to use their cell phone so bad they can use it when they get home. School is for learning and nothing else.
