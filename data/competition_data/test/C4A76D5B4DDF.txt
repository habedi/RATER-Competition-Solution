Cellphones & Driving

More and more people are finding access to cell phones as technology develops and becomes more inexpensive. Cars are starting to become more technologically advanced as well. With the ever evolving future of technology people are making questionable choices such as time and place of use. More and more people have began using their electronic devices as they drive putting not only themselves but the lives of others in danger. Cellphones should not be used while operating machinery such as a car or truck or SUV.

When driving you should always have your attention on the road as to avoid any bad situation or at least help prevent one. Cell phones distract you from this goal and may cause you to get side tracked. Without the use of phones behind the wheel there's less likely a chance that you will get into a wreck.

These self driving cars may still have trouble reacting to split second decisions in which May cause you harm. Even if you don't have to drive yourself you should still be focused on the road. A cell phone may be more appropriate in this situation given that you're not the one driving the car at the time however to ensure safety do not use your phone until the vehicle is safely parked and there is no risk of a wreck.

Bluetooth technology has been changing the way we use electronic devices for years. With this there is no reason to constantly be in use of your phone when the Bluetooth streams the audio directly from the device to your cats radio. People have created mount devices for phone in cars to help keep you off them more but still do miniscule tasks that you may deem necessary. Many people put their phone in the back seat just to keep it out of arms reach and dampen the temptation of usage.

Ultimately cellphones in cars are a bad idea. Drivers still need to pay attention to the road rather than to a device that's endangering their lives. Despite all of the advances in technology there's not a single one which ensures complete safety. The use of Bluetooth and other strategies to help limit cellphone usage may help if a drive is in need of a prevention plan for cell phone usage while driving. Don't endanger yourself or others by not operating a motorized vehicle with a cellphone in use.
