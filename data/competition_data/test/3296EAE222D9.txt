The world we live in is a crazy, stressful place! We should always take a step back and think about the times when we were in kindergarten and life was enjoyable because we used to tell our teachers what kind of projects and activities we would like to do in our breaks. When I was in kindergarten, me and my friends used to tell our teachers what kind of projects we would love to do. Imagine if the projects were student designed, it would make summer breaks so much better and fun. When did everyone started to make life so complicated? We should embrace the simplicity of our childhood. We were taught by our teachers and parents to do what we love for a reason. Just because they seem basic doesn't mean they will stop mattering in our lives. Although a lot of people say summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know what's best for us and what we should learn, it is important for the projects to be student designed because student's can communicate with each other during summer breaks, they will be productive, they can focus better and be happy.

If the project's are student designed, students will be able to communicate with each other during their breaks. They would talk to each other: learn how to manage time and complete the project's and it will help them when they enter work force. By working on projects together, student's will make stronger friendships and relation's with each other. If they have projects which include communicating with each another, it will make sure they are in touch with their friend's. Some students don't call their friends which ends up losing connection with them: tasks which include communication will make sure they are in touch. Students will make good bonds and ties with their friends which is going to be really helpful when they are in need of their friends. The project's should include going to the stream or river and capturing the water and bringing it to school and testing it in the lab, as a result student's will learn time management. Student's can work with their friend's to reach a common goal. Most student's nowadays sit at home in their rooms all day long, play video games, and don't spend doing activities outdoor which is not healthy. When I have summer breaks, I just sit at home, watch videos in my home and don't step out of the house because the projects are teacher designed which are not fun. In elementary school, the projects were student designed which made life so much better. When student's enter work force, students will be working with individuals and should know how to handle situations and manage their time. That's why student's should have projects which include collaboration. This is why the project's should be student designed and include outdoor activities so that student's can go out and explore new things and stay in touch.

If the project's are student designed, student's will stay busy and productive. If they have multiple projects they love to do, they will always make out time to do it, which is going to keep them busy and make them appreciate their time and things they have. If student's are busy during their summer breaks, it will make sure that they stay out of trouble since most kid's just sit at home, waste their whole time of summer breaks, and do nothing which result's in getting them in trouble by their parent's. Parent's want their student's to be productive during breaks, student designed project's will make sure they stay busy and that they are always being productive. It will make sure student's understand work and play balance which is really important for them when they grow up and get a job. In my summer breaks, I just waste my time being on the phone and not do anything productive. If the tasks were student designed, I would love doing them. It would help me understand time management and how to be productive which is really important in our daily lives.

Student designed projects make you focus and make you happy because it's a project you love doing. It would give you less stress because you would know that it's student designed and working on it will make you happy. Students will be happy that they have some of their favorite task to do since summer break is all boring and there is nothing to do. They will know how to be responsible by doing their tasks and not waste their time. They will understand time value and how to work by themselves. Student's can get to know more about themselves, figure out who they really are, and what kind of activities they love to do. If they had a long day, coming home and realizing they have their favorite project to do would make them really happy. When I have a bad day at work, I come home and figure out I have a project to do makes me really excited about it. Working on my favorite project makes me focus better and makes me feel I know what I'm doing. This is why summer project's should be something which makes student's happy and focus better.

Some people say projects should be teacher designed because teacher's know what you should be learning in the grade you are in; however, student designed projects are important because students can communicate with their peers and have strong bonds, be busy and productive by working on tasks, and to focus better and be responsible.

Student designed projects will benefit students the most and help them in their daily lives by having them know the value of time, how to work with individuals, and how to have stronger communities and relations. These are really important when we get older and life becomes complicated.
