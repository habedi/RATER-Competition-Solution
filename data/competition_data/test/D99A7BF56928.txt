Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I respect you, but every kid in this building loves having sports. We love the idea and action of smiling while having a good exercise with our friends. We naturally crave fun activities while in school because it gives us a break from sitting down, taking notes, and doing work for a period of time in the school day. Also, our guardians, teachers and peers advise us that being active for an hour a day is good for us. Even though one period is not an hour, 45 minutes of activity and exercise is quiet close, nonetheless. I have a theory that if people, especially teenagers, aren't active they won't live as long or healthy life as people who are active. This is because exercising leads to good health. Everyone wants or has that so that leads to a healthy lifestyle. A healthier lifestyle often leads to a longer life all together.

Also, if an average number of the students have a C average and the requirement is a B average, then the majority of kids won't be active. What will they do, watch a handful, maybe not even, of people have fun and be active? If kids know that they aren't going to be active, have fun, or do anything a whole period then more kids will cut class and with that comes a higher risk of violence or in appropriate actions in school. If majority of kids will do work as others don't then it could get confusing, whose playing and whose not. Some kids would probably lie and say they have a B average when they don't.

Even after all of this, if you don't completely agree with me, I have a compromise in mind. There won't be only a handful of kids playing if you just have the expectation to a C average at the least. In these type of situations, I think majority rules and the majority in this case is a C average oppose to a B average. It sure will have a lot less problems and a lot more exceptions as well as smiles.
