I disagree with this decision because not everyone does nor likes to do activitys. Some people like to do activitys like sports and yearbook but to force all students to do an extracurricular activity is unfair to those who dont want to. It should be a choice whether or not you want to have a extracurricular activity or not. I say it should be a choice because alot of people dont like to be active and dont try. If a principal trys to force extracurricular activities on his\her students than most students wont like nor participate in most of the activitys the classes will be doing once they are in the class.

If i where to agree with this decision than i would say that it would be a great idea for the people who do like to play sports, help with yearbook, and be on the student council. I would also say it would be a great opportunity for the students who dont like these activities because it would give them a chance to be active and to give them a chance to have an activity involving the student council or yearbook.

But im not, i fully disagree with this decision due to its idea of making students participate in activitys that they may or may not want to participate in.Â
