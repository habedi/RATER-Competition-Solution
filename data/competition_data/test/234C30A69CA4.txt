Dear Principal,

I am a fellow student who is against you for changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

A few reasons why is because if you did that then our school wouldn't be so fun.

Another reason is because our students wouldn't be able to develop as much team working skills or they wouldn't be in to good health.

My last reason is because it keeps kids off the streets and keeps them out of trouble.

An example of my first reason is that if I were going to school I would actually want to have an activity or sport to look forward to.

Instead of making the qualifying grade a B average it should be a C average.

Then the students would have to get mandatory tutoring to help bring up their grades.

They can go during lunch or recess so that it wont interfere with their activities or sports.

Another example for my second reason is that by being in a sport or some kind of group activity it helps us develop good team work.

It can also help out our school get more publicity for all of our good athletes and smart kids.

And finally my example for my last reason.

By being able to be in these activities it keeps kids out of trouble and off the streets.

This can help out the community a lot and hopefully change their ways or bad habits.

That way we can have better students.

All in all these are my reasons of why you should not change the school policy so that students with a B average can't be in any sports or activities.

I hope you take my views into consideration.

Sincerely,
