Phones and Driving

Driving is the most used form of transportation worldwide, it is everyone's personal transportation to go anywhere. Even though automobiles are used on the daily, car accidents occur every day in the U.S, there is about 3,287 deaths a day due to a car accident and yearly there are around 2 million people are in a car accidents. Humans are on their phones every day either talking on the phone, texting, or on social media. On average people use their phone for over 5 hours a day. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Phones should not be used while driving.

Driving is a big responsibility that some people don't necessarily take seriously, which is why people text and drive which has been the cause for a lot of accidents. On average the age people are texting and driving is between 18 and 34, which is also the age group where people get into a car accident. About 35% of teenagers get into an accident because they were using their phones while driving. Driving and texting is a bad combination and should be banned in all states just for safety reasons.

Although texting and driving is not the safest way of driving, it does have a positive effect when driving. For example, if you're in another state trying to figure out where you are going, then it is acceptable to use your phone for directions. Phone companies and care companies are making it safer to drive while on the phone because they added Bluetooth to the cars to make it easier to talk on the phone without having to grab their phone. Although these are positive attributes, the negative attributes dealing with texting and driving involve car accidents and sometimes even death. This could be avoided if phones usage while driving is banned.

Phone usage while driving is way too distracting, especially for those who already drive recklessly. There are allot of younger people who like to drive fast and recklessly because they want to feel that rush of speeding on the highway and passing an abundance of cars. What makes that situation much worst is, the younger new drivers will drive really fast and will be on their phone trying to text their friends or on social media. This is how car accidents are caused and how deaths occur with those accidents.

In conclusion, driving is a big responsibility and something people should take more serious, especially if they have passengers in the car. When you're driving with passengers, their safety and the driver's safety is very important. So their priority should be the people in the car and others on the road, not their phone and who texted them or who liked what on social media. Think about it like this, social media will always be there when you're here or not, so is getting on your phone while driving worth the risk of losing your life or taking someone else's life?
