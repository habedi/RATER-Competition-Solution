To the principal

I can see way you what the kids to get B average instead of a C average, but it is probably hard as it is for some students to get a C average.

If you are going to change the C to a B average you should have after school tooter for the students that are having a hard time.

Now I can under stand if you see most of the students are just lazy ,or you don't have any money to afford tooters. If don't have any money for the tooters just get some of the teachers to help or some of the lazy students to be less lazy and help there team out by tottering. If you don't do this it well be unfair to the students who want play sports but have a hard time with their grade. So change the average, just have some help for the students that are having a hard time.
