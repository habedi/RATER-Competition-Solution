dear principle,

I think you should us kids have our phones and use them during school. The reason i think should phones in school is because, we like using our phone all day. But if we atleast get the privilege of using the phone during our free time we wouldn't be interested in our phones during class. We like to communicate at all times. Atleast we would have like 30min out of our whole lunch time. I agree it is also a bad idea to have phones in school because it distracts us from our school work but we also deserve that privilege.

I don't think having no phones in school is a good well thought idea. The reason i think why is because kids would just be doing the same there doing now. They would sneak in there phones to school and use the phones during classes. I also think it would just make some think it would be making it worse, therefore our grades will drop over a few text messages.

I do think some of use will follow the rule of having our phones off during class time because we get the freedom of using i during lunch. So we would get bored of our phone's once we get to go to class that we wouldn't have the need to use our phone's. We deserve that space and privilege to use our phones during our free time because of course it is our free time. That is why i think policy 1 is or would be the best choice or decision for the school rules.
