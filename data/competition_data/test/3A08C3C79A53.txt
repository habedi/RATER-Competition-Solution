Venus's reputation is challenging for humans to study. It's a thick atmospere of close to about 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Venus is even more challenging because ther're clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in there atomospere,on their surface ther're tempature averages at about 800 degrees farenheit. And the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times greater than what our scientist are experincing on our own planet. Venus's conditions are far more extreme than anything we humans encounter on earth.

Venus's weather has additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. An paragraph 6 sentence 1 it says that venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Also an paragraph 7 sentence 2 its says Venus surface have lasted for three weeks in such condition that another project is looking back an to the old technology.

However, peering at Venus on a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot ttake samples of rock, gas, or anything else froma a distance.
