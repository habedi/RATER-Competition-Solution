do you like to stay at school, or drive around just to get home at 6:00 pm? no? same. studies show that when a student does extracurricular activities, students either cant do them, dont have the funds, and even focuses on the activity more than school. students not having a way to go or leave the activity, not having the money for the activity, and most kids not getting their homework and school work done, are all reasons why students should not be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity.

most kids wont have a way of getting or leaving the extracurricular activity. the average time a parent works is until 5:00 pm , and most activities start at 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm, and end at 5:00 pm. most parents will not be able to drop off their child or pick them up from thier activity. if the school does not provide buses, how will the child get home without a car? some children only way of getting to school is a bus, and if the school does not supply buses for the children they will not be able to go home. if the school is going to supply buses, it will be very expensive. if every student has do a activity ,that is a lot of buses the school has to pay for, especially if the school is already struggling to pay other school expenses.

some kids will not have the money for the extracurricular activity. sports cost a lot of money. sports have a lot of things you have to pay for, uniform, co pay, and things to play the sport . but a good amount of students will not be able to pay all the money needed for the sport. the extracurricular activity favors people with money, more than people with less. activities will favor students with money because they can pay for all the things needed for that activity, so kids who can not pay will be stuck with the activities that cost less and suck. also the school will have to pay for people to stay after school , for the extracurricular activities. the school will have to pay even more money for people to even stay after school to teach the activities.

some people say its good for kids to do extracurricular activities. what happens when the children care more about the activity, than school? by the time kids get home from the activity, they will not have time to do there homework. if they get home at 5:30 , they will not have time to eat dinner, shower, brush their teeth, and change into pajamas, by then they will be too tired to do thier homework. also the activity will have things they have to do for them as well. sports you have to practice for, chess club needs you to practice chess, and math club need you to study math questions, so all that time kids are spending on things for the activity they could be doing something for school. kids will start to not do thier work because they think thats the only fun part about school. most kids see some thing like football , soccer, and math club as the only way they can make it into a good collage so they start to focus more on the activity, then thier school work.

the reason why students should not be forced to do extracurricular activities is because kids dont have a way of getting there or leaving, some kids will not have the money, and kids will not get thier schoolwork done.
