Extracurricular activities are great ways to make friends, learn new skills, and have fun. I believe all students should have the option to participate in an extracurricular activities, however I don't think all students have to participate in them. They already have homework in Math, English, Civics, and Science and now you have to spend another hour or so doing a debate club you don't even want to be in. Does that seem fair? Students already have to spend over 7 hours at school they should be able to spend their free time in the way they want to spend it.

Although extracurricular activities are beneficial in many areas, it seems unfair to force every student to participate in them. The reason for this is a student spends 7 hours a day in school, and on top of that the average time spent on homework each day is from 30 minutes to 2 hours! That can add up to 9 hours of work that they are forced to do. Students deserve a little time to themselves so they can relax from all the stress they had to deal with during school. I think extracurricular activities might be beneficial for some people but they can be detrimental to others.

Students spend over 7 hours a day at school and 30 minutes to 2 hours doing homework. All students should be able to choose for themselves whether or not they want to participate in an extra curricular activity. Students need time to themselves to relax and have fun with their friends. They also need time to study for tests and complete homework.

If you force students to participate in an extracurricular activity your going to add to their stress and just make school more of a burden and less of a place to learn.
