Today Â¸ drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Why ? Because too many accidents are happening causing people people to lose their loved ones and important people in their life. Another reason is because it is a law now and you shouldn't be breaking the law. Then it causes a lack of driving skills.

Everyday people die in car accident because they use cell phones. Over the past couple of years, over 1.5 million people have lost their life or loved one's due to people being on their phones while driving. Being on your phone while driving is so dangerous because you can hit somebody and cause a bad wreck possibly killing somebody, putting them in the hospital, making them paralyzed , and not just that, but losing your car. People should not use cell phones while driving because a person could be having a conversation, they might get upset, and it could cause the driver to lose control of the car.

People should not use cell phones while driving because it's a law you shouldn't want to break. If you are caught breaking the law of no cell phones while driving, it could result in bad consequences. Consequences like getting your license suspended, and not being able to drive until further notice. Also, you might get a ticket or taken to jail and that's something you don't want. If it's something so important that you have to check your phone, you should pull over or wait until you get to where you are going. They have invented a phone dock were you sit your phone while driving and I still think it's unsafe because people are still attempting to still use their phones while driving.

People who are usually using phones while driving seem to have lack of driving skills which causes the car to go off the road, maybe get too close to another car, and can end up in the lane next to them. Lack of driving skills is the biggest thing that most people have today. Using phones can cause drives to take their eyes off the road, their hands off the road. This appears to have the biggest impact on a lot of drivers that use their phones while driving.

People shouldn't use phones while driving. It would stop a lot pf car accidents, tickets, death lack of driving skills etc. If drivers put their phones down while driving this would save a lot of lives been taking due to car accidents. If people don't give up cell phones while driving, the number of fatalities on the road will increase each year. With all this being said,

I don't think it safe to use your phone while operating a vehicle.
