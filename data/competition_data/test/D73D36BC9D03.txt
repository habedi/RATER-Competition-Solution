Venus is our sister planet how. You see at on time in our solar system venus was the most Earth-like planet. long ago it was probably covered with oceans that could had sopported various forms of life. It still has some features like earth like valleys and mountains.

It the closes to earth in terms of density and size. but that means that its not to close to the sun if it was it be hot to hot for life to live on it. life cant live on it cuz of that thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide. Cuz of hat atmosphere it temperatuers average over 800 degrees fahrenheit the pressure is 90 times greater then Earth.

We should not be limated by danger but by imagination and innovation. However if we peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely above the planit at 30 miles. WE whould not have to deal whith its unfriendly ground by staning far up and away from its atmosphere. but orbiting or hovering venus whoude be limited insight on ground most forms of light cannot penetrate its thick atmosphere.
