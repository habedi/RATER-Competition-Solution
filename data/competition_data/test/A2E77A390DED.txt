Dear Principal,

I think that u should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods. It would make it better for students than be texting or calling in class. Students would pay more attention in class. Then being on there cell phone. But if the teacher see them using there phone they should take it away. They would get there phone back at the end of the day. If they get there phone taking away again in class. They would keep the phone in the office and make there parents come and pick there phone up after school. But when it come to lunch they can use there phone as much as they want. They can call there mom or family if they really need something important. When lunch is over they would turn there phone off. Walk to class and be learning.

That why you should let use the phone during lunch period and free time.
