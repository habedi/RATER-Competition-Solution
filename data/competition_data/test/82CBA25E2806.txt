Doing classes from home has been an up and coming subject due to the fact that schools are now handing out school issued laptops. Schooling from home can have major benefits such as being able to sleep in more, being able to do work in the comfort of their own home, and having a wider range in classes as you will have an online professor thus creating a wider range of available classes, compared to what you're given at school. Now the draw back that many parents and students have with it is that there will be too many distractions at home for the student to concentrate. While in theory that sounds true that isn't really the case.

With the opportunity to take online classes, students would be able to sleep in more, thus leading them to live healthier lives, and not always be so tired. Students wouldn't have to wake up at six o'clock in the morning just to make their bus at seven to get to a school that starts at eight. They would be able to wake up at seven fifty, to get ready for a class at eight, since all the student would have to do is just open his or her computer, log in, then go to the online class to get the information that is being taught. This would allow those sleep deprived students who have after school activities such as sports or a job to nearly get an extra two hours of sleep. This could also be beneficial for the teacher, allowing them the same exact thing, when it comes to waking up later and allowing them to sleep in and get the rest your body needs to be physically healthy. Also, allowing kids to sleep in and get the necessary sleep they need will cause them to be more engaged in the classroom, and excited to learn, whether it is at home or in a school building.

While doing online classes, students would also get the opportunity to do work in the comfort of the student's own home. People in general are more comfortable in their own home, so when given the opportunity to work there, they will likely produce a better outcome as they are more relaxed and aren't as stressed unlike students in school. Students would not have to put on certain types of clothing to impress anybody, helping reduce anxiety about what people think about a person's self. This would also help in decreasing bullying in school cause when someone is at home away from their bully its nearly impossible for the student to feel threatened by the bully while at home, and can even cause the child to want to learn again since they aren't worried about one person messing up their day. And having children engaged in learning and constantly wanting to learn is usually a school's number one priority.

One great benefit that doesn't get brought up enough when talking about online class is the fact that students will actually have a wider range in available classes to take. When it comes to being online, people basically have all the knowledge in the world at their finger tips. In school students have the knowledge of out dated textbooks and their teachers. With the ability to take online classes, students are now able to basically take any class they so please to take. Also, if a student attends a certain school, but then wants to learn a certain skill outside of it, like IT, they would have to go to another school to learn it, then have to comeback to school, or if none of the schools in the area offer training on the skill the person wants to learn, that is severely limiting that person's full potential. With online classes there is no limit on what you can learn, everything is already on the internet, they will just need to know where to look. Also, once they find the certain skill or class they want to take, they'll be able to go to where they need to be rested and happy, and will also know what they're learning is something they actually want to learn.

The one draw back that people have though is that they think learning at home will cause too many distractions so they won't learn. While that sounds like a very legitimate rebuttal to learning at home, that truly isn't. The main one being that, there are already distractions in school, and whether or not the students acknowledge them or leave them alone is completely up to them, the same is true for learning at home. Yes there are distractions, but if the student ignores them like how the should as if they were in school, then there is no problem. And if the student decides to engage on the distractions they more than likely not were doing them in school, and weren't paying attention to begin with. Students have distractions in school no matter what, and saying that learning at home isn't viable because of it isn't a true or fair statement to make.

So basically, taking classes at home can be very beneficial to a student. It can help them get the required sleep that they need. Once getting the sleep they need, these students will feel more rested and excited to attend school cause they won't feel tired or groggy anymore. They'll also be able to work from the comfort of their own home, making them feel safer and calmer. And they will also get a wider variety of class selection if taking it online, thus keeping students interested in school.
