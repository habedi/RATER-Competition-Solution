If doing online courses or classes at home help students a lot more with their everyday life, is it really helpful to attend those things? Today I will discuss my argument on why online courses would definitely benefit students in their lives.

Waking up every weekday morning to go to class can be a hassle for some or even most students, but having to do online courses can stop you from waking up every morning to get to class before 7:20 am. The reason why I agree with this idea is that it benefits students who have to work at home or do other things in their life that can help them prepare for college courses or even multitasking alone. If you have to go to work at the morning while having a paper or even a project due the same way, you don't have to go to class in the morning. You'll miss your work and have to schedule for another time to clock in and it will be a whole mess for you if you don't have a online course. If you're a high school student and you don't have a job or anything else important for you to do all the time, you'll still benefit from having 8 hour classes then online courses.

Now, safety is the most important thing when it comes to your everyday life as an individual, so students going to school every morning, on a weekday, going from class to class until their 8 hours are up can very much raise their concerns about their safety and how they can prevent themselves from getting hurt. Students come to school making sure the school protects them while they are in their classes building up and getting their careers ready when they step foot out the school. If their can be one way to prevent those concerns, it has to be online courses. You don't want to have a call one day talking about your child being hurt while you're away at work, you wouldn't want to take your child back to school after what happened cause the school didn't do their job of protecting your kid while you were away. Thats why doing online courses will be a lot more safer and helpful for you as a parent. Doing an online course can reduce how much you have to pay when it comes to going to school.

The most important to me when it comes to an online course is that it can help me or even other students to be on their own and have more of a responsibility at home or wherever we are. Now I understand that you don't have to do online courses cause it doesn't help you focus or even give you as much of a responsibility when it comes to school things, but even some of the things we do in school can be really dumb and not give us as much of a purpose as to why we are doing what were are doing. If I was to get into a fight with someone, I would have to get detention or ISS or even be suspended or expelled, as to online, that won't be a problem cause i'm not going to be around no one or even be mad at someone because of something so dumb that shouldn't be the reason to why I came to school or even force myself into having a career or even an education. School is a way to understanding in the real world, as much as math or other things won't benefit me as much when I go out there and do what i've always wanted to do, it will still be important to me in my life.

Attending classes from home can benefit me and others in many different ways, but having to do so, there should be a responsibility to take while having to do online courses. Now, in the future, there should be a online course for all schools so there can be less of a safety hazard to students and less of a hassle when attending a public or private school.
