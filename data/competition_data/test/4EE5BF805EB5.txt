A old man told me once " the future dose not come to you. you go to the future". I agree with the principal making every student do one extracurricular activity. The principal making every one do extracurricular activities is a good idea. Its a new way to make friends and have fun, and it can help find what you might want to do in your future.

Making everyone do a extracurricular activity is beneficial for the students and the school. These extracurricular activities will help people be able to make new friends because they will share a common interest .When I grew up in Generic_City from first to third grade. I did a lot of extracurricular activities .one of them were soccer. I met a couple of kids that also liked soccer too. So me and my friends would stay after school to play soccer everyday.

extra curicular activites would help us find our passion for what we want do in the future. extra curiculat activitys might help student what they want to do in their future at a very young age. people who are in journalism club might want to be a journalist in the futrure. people who loved scince club and all the cool experiments might want to become a scientist when they grew up.

When the old man first told "future dose not come to you. you go to the future." I was confused. every second that passes by I go a little bit into the future but now I get it. I cant expect my future dream job to just fall into my hands. I need to work to get it. in the end making everyone do extracurricular activities are beneficial. they would help us find what we wanted to do with our future and help us make new freinds.
