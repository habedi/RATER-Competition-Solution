Unmasking the Face on Mars is a mystery that is still to be solved. Me as a NASA scientist, I have many pieces evidence to prove that this mysterious face landform was just caused by craters or natural weathring straking the red planet. My evidence will prove a person who believes in aliens creating this face incorrect.

To prove that aliens didn't have any effect on Mars, many natural landforms we have on earth can predict and support that this face was naturally occuring. These images in 1976, 1998, and 2001 remind scientists of the landforms on Earth such as a butte or mesa. To prove this, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) caught images of the face on camera. It was clear it was just a regular landform, not a special, purposefully made alien monument.

The technology we have today makes it clear that the face was just made by natural causes. Our cameras have a clear shot and bigger pixel size digital image. They would have seen any other objects located around the landform like airplanes or pyramids that people believe were made by aliens. There weren't any! The landform looks like a face in ways but it's easy to tell it was made by incoming asteroids on the landscape of the planet. The light from the sun and the shadowing just makes the landform look as if it had eyes, nose, and a mouth.

This evidence given proves a person who believes that aliens created this mysterious face on the red planet wrong. Through the process of unmasking the face, it is clear that natural disasters and weathering happened to create a resemblance of this structure. Unmasking the Face on Mars is still a mystery to be solved for years to come.
