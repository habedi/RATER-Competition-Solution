Do you always come home from school with so much to get done? Well what if you had no choice but to participate in a extracurricular activity. That would'nt be fair right. As an eighth grader in middle school, having a lot of homework, working on projects, and studying is already a lot, and adding a sport to that would be more stressful. We all can relate to being stressed and pressured. Which is why I disagree that students must participate in a extracurricular activity because, it can be stressful on some students, students have other activities outside of school, and lastly students should be able to make their own choices.

Some students come home with so much work that needs to get done, and that alone can be very stressful. Now imagine what some students would have to go through if they had to join a sport or student council. Its too much for some students to handle at a young age. Making it a must to participate in a extracurricular activity, with students who are in honors or AP classes is a lot of stress for them, considering all the homework and studying they have. All that stress could lead to sleeping problems or worse, which could interfere with a students performance at school.

Not all students have the time to stay after school. Many students may have other activities outside of school, that can already be tough on them. Students might already have a sport they play outside of school they need to attend. Every team depends on their teammates, and if they have to participate in an extracurricular activity in school, it would effect them and their team. Some students may also have community service, or a church program they might have to attend. participating in a extracurricular activity would effect their everyday after school activities would be effected.

As students we should be able to make our own choices. It would'nt be fair to us if we did'nt have a choice. As we are getting older our choices in school should matter. they should'nt take that privilege away from us as students. If we want to join a sport, it should be the students choice. If we want to serve on the student council, it should be the students choice. They should'nt have to if they don't want to, or have the time to.

In summary, I disagree with students having no choice but to participate in extracurricular activities. It would be stressful on some students, many students have activities outside of school, and students should be able to make their own choices. Some students have busy lives, and other complicated things they go through after and during school. Its a lot for students and if they can't fit anything else in their schedule they should'nt have to. As students participating in an extracurricular activities should be a choice, not a must.
