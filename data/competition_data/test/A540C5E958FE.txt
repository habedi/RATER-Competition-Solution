Dear principal,

Students should be required ti perform community service. Helping the community is very important. You might get sick if you stay next unclean air or place. If you think that it takes a along time, we can do it in groups. It's really important to leave the earth clean. We are the ones who make the earth clean or dirty place. If the earth is clean that means were clean. The earth represent who we are. So let them go to a feel trip to the ocean or beach to clean the trash that some people leave behind them. If we don't clean the earth, we will be stuck up eating with unhealthy things. And the trash from the floor would go to the ocean. Its a hard thing for you not having water, so we need to clean up the earth. Because if that trash went in the water, we can not drink water at all. And no body can live without water.

What about factories and cars, they are responsible for it to. And if you don't let them clean up the earth or the school, they would live with this trashy air and place. Imagine what it would be like to have those things. Then it would be hard to clean after your self. So think about it. If you like my idea, let your students to go to a trip and let them clean up the earth. And if you don't like this idea, just please let them clean after their self or let them clean the school after there done with their work.

love, student
