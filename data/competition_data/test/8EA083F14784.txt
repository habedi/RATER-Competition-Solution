The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These extracurricular activities include sports, student council, work on the yearbook, and other activities. This will force students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. I disagree with this requirement, for it can be stressful, it forces the students who dislike these activities to participate, and it takes away time for their other responsibilities.

First, students might find extracurricular activities stressful. Students who dislike having to work with others are forced into an uncomfortable situation when they are forced to participate in extracurricular activities along with other students. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and some students may not be able to because they have responsibilities at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of homework and other responsibilities at home.

Then, their grades may drop. If a student is required to leave class for their extracurricular activity while doing something important in class like notes then their grade may drop because they missed that work. Students may have work for an extracurricular activity and that work may pile up with work from their other classes. For example, My friend Generic_Name does student council and we were taking notes in class when they made an announcement for all student council members to meet in the library and Generic_Name ended up missing all of the notes for the test the next day.

Also, students may have other responsibilities at home. Students my have responsibilities at home like walking their dog, cleaning the dishes, doing laundry, and other responsibilities. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and that takes away the time for the responsibilities the have at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of my homework and other responsibilities at home.

However, students may enjoy extracurricular activities. Students may choose to participate in extracurricular activities, for it can be a way to have fun, you get to spend time with friends, and it gives you a time away from all of the stressful school work. For example, I do not get to spend time with friends during class because we are working and extracurricular activities can be a way for me to see friends and have fun. That is why some students may choose to participate in these extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, Students who are forced to participate in after school activities may lose time for school work, responsibilities, and personal time. When a student is forced into an activity that they dislike it they might slack off and that can distract other students who care about their activity from thier work. Students should have a choice of what they do during and after school because it can affect their attitude towards their school work. That is why I disagree with the principal's requirement.
