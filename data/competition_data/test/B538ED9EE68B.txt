Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, I like Policy 1 about the cell phone conflict.

Policy 1 states, "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time." Why do I believe this policy is better? Here are my reasons:

Students may have an emergency and may need to contact their parent or guardian. It may be about something they forgot at home, cancelled club meetings and sports practices/games, or asking a question about something. Parents may also need to contact their son or daughter about any type of emergency, or letting the student know something. If students are allowed to use their phones during lunch and free times, they are easily able to contact their parents or guardian, or vice versa.

If students are given the privilege of being able to use their cell phones during lunch and free time, they will most likely be texting other students, whether that student is in the school or not. A lot of the time it may keep the students quiet and busy. If the students are responsible and don't fool around, they should be given the chance to use their cell phones.

Also, since students will most likely carry their cell phones around if they are given the privilege to use them during appropriate times, if there is an emergency at school such as a school fire, they can easily text message and/or call their parent or guardian to let them know exactly what is going on in the situation and to let them know that they are okay and safe.

If students abuse the privilege, such as doing inappropriate things with their cell phone, their text messages have been reported, or they have used them during class when they are not supposed to, teachers should be allowed to take the student's phone away and possibly give them other consequences for their action.

If students break or lose their phone, it is their fault and their responsibility, and the school should not have to take the blame for it. That wouldn't be fair, seeing that it is the student's property.

I believe that as long as students are using their cell phones appropriately, following the rules, and accepting the consequences if they abuse the privilege, they should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and their free time. Cell phones really come in handy nowadays, especially when contact is need to be made between two people right away. I believe that Policy 1 is the way to go. At least give it a try.

Thank you,

Sincerely,
