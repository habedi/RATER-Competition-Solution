This technology can be very helpful with students who get bored or confused. I'm not going to lie i get bored too sometimes and i feel that this technology would to keep me intrested or help me how to do things. In paragragh 6 it says," A class room computer could recongize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."

It is valuable because then you can tell when some one is lying or trying to hide experssions. What if some one killed somebody and they said they didnt do it, but when they use the software they can tell that they didi it. The author states,"even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Using video imagery, the new emotion- recognition software tracks these facial movments. Each expressions is compared against a neutral face."

All in all, this technology could be a big improvment on our schools and how the students study or even how they learn. A students emotions can go from bored to woah this is awesome and even i get it now. If my school had this technology i wouldnt take it for granted also i would probably benifit from this new facial technoloy.
