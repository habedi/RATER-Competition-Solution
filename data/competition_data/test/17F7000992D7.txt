According to

The New York Times , more than 25% of teeneger died everyday in car accidents while their are on the way to school. Today apperently students are the most common target. They are not only risking thier lives in the way to school, also they are not safe there. "Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing." The best way for sudents to learn more and be safe is taking classes online because students will concentrate more in their required classes, and they will spend more time with their family.

First, students will concentrate more in their required classes. I knew a guy in El Salvador, he was recently graduated from High School, in four months he was going to start college, but it was two hours away from his home. He found out that he had the option to take classes online. He told me about the experience he had, he said that it was very cool becuase he could concentrate more, and classes are more fluent that allow students to learn more and, also help students to find more about themselves. Of not being afraid to talk, thinking that others students will make fun of them, student can have the chance to fell free of self-expressions It also give students the opportunity to meet new people.

Second, parents will be more calm knowing that thier children are in home safe, instead of being worry that something bad could happen to them. As is good for students it also parents has the adventage. About one years ago my aunt has a experience with her son. The school that he goes was being shot aproximally seven students were shot, and three students died, the school were closed for one week she was afraid send him back to school, so she decided to pay classes online to him. She said that it was going to be more expensive, but dhe wants the best for her son. after three month she saw how her son was improving better then when he was assiting at school. Also they have more time to expend time with the family.

Some people may say, that students who take classes online would not experiment real life, and when they decide to come to the real world it will be so hard to adat themselves, or when they start working they would not have any clue how to treat with the people around them. However if students take classes online they will be more related with new people, and more easier to find a good job.

In conclusion, if students take classes online because of thier experince, and their abilities they will be the future of the world.
