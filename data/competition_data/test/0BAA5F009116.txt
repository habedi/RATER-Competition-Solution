Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students should design these projects to let the teacher see how creative students can be. Also to show the diffrent ways students can use their mind to comlete the project in the course of the their break. In some cases students will not want to do any work over their break, but if these students can design the assignment and do what ever project they want to do they will be willing to do the work. Furthermore, students being able to design a project for the course of summer break will help students learn how to complete a task they assign themelves and will help students be able to set goals and accomplish them in the future.

This form of learning can assist students in being creative and opening up the mind to new things. Those qualitys help expand the information you know and can benefit you in the long run. These things form a intellegent mind thats why I feel its a need to try and do new things to learn. For example, there was a time when I was told by a teacher to try a new method in reading that I come up with because she said thats something to make you remember what youve just learned ,and ever since then I have always been open to new things and ideas when it comes to coming up with a new way of learning. Therefore, I always try to incourage others to do the same because its something that strenghtings you, opens the mind, and makes you a smarter individual.

Using your mind in diffrent ways stimulates students brains and Creates new pathways for information to be shared. This is a way to get a better understanding of ways you can look at certain situations as a student. For instance, you might not like the way things are going in class but if you were to sit and think of better ways to handle the problem it will show you that thinking in diffrent ways can make a problem a blessing you just have to be willing to put forth the effort. trying is better than not trying and that can make a big diffrence in your life and how you live it. It takes being diverse on how you think to become a great student.

Students creating their own project for their summer break is one of the best things you can get a student to do because they have to think and use diffrent ideas to complete a assignment that they choose. Its important to understand the importance of this because it will give them something to do to remember what they learned from school in the past year while they are on summer break, so they can't forget any information that is needed for years to come. Also will be alot easier for them to accomplish things in the future due to working in the summer nights through school and this will highly benefit the students and their future. Thats the reason I think this will be beneficial to anyone who attempts.

Another reason is that it will prepare the students for a heavy work load in years to come. For example, being in highschool and later going on to college is not just a walk in the park its hard days and long nights to accomplish something bigger. Students doing this at a young age will have them ready for the highschool and college lifestyle. Also will give them something they can never loose and thats the dicipline you get from doing obstacles like this because it keeps you from getting distracted and helps you focus harder on the project and they all starts with you aswell so its the dicipline you aquire from doing things like that.

In conclusion, students are required to design their own project they are to complete over the course of summer and create it by themselves. I agree with this because it can give the students important qualities that they only can get from doing something like a self made project and can benefit them for their future. Doing certain things in life are only to help you learn and grow and doing a project like this will help you be able to multitask and do things a different way then you see everyone else doing. Therefore students designing their own projects can help and benefit them to be a better individuals in the future.
