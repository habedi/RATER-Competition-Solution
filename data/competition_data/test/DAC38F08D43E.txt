wether you are 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percet angry people shouldnt go around measruing your emotions. I think that emotions are something very personal that should be kept for ourselves. There is a difference between asking a friend how they feel and being there for then versus measuring their emotions, and only working on that part of emotiong thatthey want to get rid of. what of they device has gathered the wrong information ? That means we would be helping people in the places they dont need help.

In the article they keep rerfering the facial muscle and what they represt and how the computer identifices them. Us humans look at people and predict they are feeling some type of way but we could be wrong, becuase only the persons can feel how that emotion. Eventhough they mention all the different features the computer has to identify our emotions I dont believe that our technology is advance to a point where it can do all of those things. In fact i believe this system is pointless becuase we dont need to worry about other people and their personal space.

In conclusion my opinion is that we dont have this system in our school. I say this because teachers shount be worried about our personal emotions. School should focus on better ways on teaching people versus worryingabout theyre personal emotions. Sometimes our emotions are not being the scholl but by the problems we have at home witch makes it irrelent to have this system. That is why i say we shouldnt have this system.
