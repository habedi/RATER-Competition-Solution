Phones & Driving

Using cell phones while driving has a big impact on car wrecks, I believe that cell phone usage while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited because they play a big part in distracting the driver.

One reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because when one is looking in their cell phone they usually look down and look back up but anything could happen in a split second leading to an immediate reaction without thought. According to studies and statistics "Almost 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving". Meaning out of all of the accidents that happen yearly 390,000 are due to texting and driving which could easily be prevented, just wait to send that text.

Another reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because it takes up time, the time you're using to send that one text or make that one call could be time used to get where you're going. The use of a cell phone while driving is inconsiderate of other drivers, it takes up their time as well. When people use their cell phones they only think of themselves, imagine if the driver behind you were in danger and you're using your phone wasting time at the green light. Most people don't put themselves in other people's places, yet things that you do can have an effect on another's personal life. If this was you in danger would you want someone driving slow in front of you because of their cell phones that they could check when they arrive to where they are going?.

Next, cell phones could cause anybody to do reckless driving. You could be on any social media and try to see what's going on in everybody else life instead of your own. Social media could wait on you until you get home. Cell phones cause reckless driving which cause accidents that could be prevented only if you waited those seconds. You never know what someone might say about you on social media, and you could get caught up in the drama. Driving while mad isn't a good mix. You could take your anger out while driving extremely fast then boom you crash.

Furthermore, you're not paying attention to your driving, and road signs. Besides the green light there are more road signs. Like what if you were on your phone and you don't see the sign that signals a deaf child is alert. Then a deaf child was crossing the street, and you crash into them. This could be murder, and soon you'll be there locked up rotting in jail. Somethings are meant to be considered before you pick up your phone and text while driving. Most accidents could be avoided if you wouldn't be so careless about others. In a passage it stated "Cell phones aren't the reason why there are car accidents." This isn't accurate because based on my research at least 88% of people die from car accidents.

In conclusion cell phones should be prohibited while driving. Most accidents can be caused by using a cell phone while driving. Think about a consequence that could come with your actions while using your cell phone, neither the less it can wait. There could be an occurring accident that could be prevented all if you would be careful and mindful of people. You should consider putting your phone on airplane mode while driving. It will make driving more easier and safer for you and the people you are surrounded by.
