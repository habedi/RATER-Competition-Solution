In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" there are examples proving that this is just a landform. In the beginning of the article is starts out with the things that could have been true such as an alien artifact. Throughout the years technology gradually improved, therefore we could see more. Some still don't believe that it could just be a landform, but I am going to try to give you multiple examples so you can see what we saw.

The first part of the article is information about what we found. It mentions how everyone made a big commotion about the Face. Who wouldn't though? We don't see this often, but it is in fact a butte or mesa. Back in 1976 we didn't get the best picture. So we got closer tried to get the best shot possible. After we got closer, also in 1976, we ended up with a success and get a clear photo. Yes, it did look like a face, also depending on which angle you look at it though. Some say it looked like it resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. It took a lot of research to realize what it was, we had an idea but we weren't so sure in the beginning.

We have people believing that NASA is lying. I can assure you we are not lying. With our budget, we wish there was an ancient civilization. This would be a breakthrough! So for everyone skeptic, and the people thinking we are lying it isn't true. We put so much money and time into researching this. It isn't an easy proccess. It's actually really hard, you have things you have to find out. We also didn't want to give out false information. We had to let people know the truth and that is why we didn't just tell everyone there was a face (landform) on Mars right away.

Eventually it led to the media. The Face was all anyone was talking about. It was everywhere. In the article it talks about how it became a "pop icon." It talks about how this ended up starring in a Hollywood film. It appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. It was all people would talk about in the grocery lines as well, or as the article calls it, "haunted grocery store checkout lines." This went on for 25 years. This was a very big conspiracy, well that's what some wanted to believe. Since it was everywhere and there were so many rumors about it, this got the people who were big conspiracy theorists all wound up. No matter what information we presented them with, they just didn't want to believe, they were feeding into their own opinions and basing everything off of the untrue rumors. There are many people who still don't believe us to this day.

We are almost 100% sure this is a landform. We have looked very, very closely at these pictures, and it has changed overtime. If you look in the article, at the very beginnning they have three pictures with different years, the first was taking in 1976. The second was in 1998 and the third was in 2001. If you look closely they aren't the same, it's a landform, it changed. We have also looked at things on earth to try to compare. We have landforms in the midwest that look like this as well. Sure some don't look exactly the same as "the Face" but that's because they are landforms. Landforms are different. Things erode and change overtime. In the article it says that Garvin had looked at some things as well and he said, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." and "That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." This is how he sees it, Which is also fact, there is a Plain in Idaho that he thinks is similar. The lava dome may be something that could have occurred with the mesa on Mars too.

In conclusion, I am writing this and including many reasons why the Face was not created by aliens because I am giving the truth. I have given more than enough reasons and so many different facts. I hope you believe me along with NASA. It's just a landform. It changes overtime, it just happened to look like a face. We get that it looked like a face, but when you think about it, it also depends on how you look at it. It was weird to a lot of people. We are sorry for any false information that was brought up. Just know that false information wasn't from us. These are the facts, I hope I have convinced you.
