In this essay Im going to be explainig about the advantage of limiting car usage. First of all a man says that when he had a car he was always tense. Now he says his more happier with out a car. Cras are good in some ways but bad in other ways because cars contaminate the air with the smoke. Their good because they take you places faster and more comftorble. But many European cities are not permiting cars, and they say is good for them. They live better now."All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberge.

In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduce" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. I think that the United States should take reducing cars in consideration, too see how it goes. After five-days of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China wich is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world. So imagen what it would do in the United States. In Bogota, Colombia a program that set to spread to the others countries million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day. Leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third year that they been doing this. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. For the first time other colimbian cities joined the event. We should have a Car-Free day here in the United states to see how it goes.

American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Maybe these means people are getting over about the car fever. People should vote to have a car-free day. It would be good people would be less tens, they would get more excercise and pollution would dropp. This would be good for you and for me.
