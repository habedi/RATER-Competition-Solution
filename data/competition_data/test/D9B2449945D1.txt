It's the last play of the State Championship you have the ball at midfield your going as fast as you can go but you know your not fast enough to out maneuver the defender insight but, you sidestep and the defender goes flying past and you walk into the end zone untouched to win the game. You look up into the stands and you see your entire town chanting your name then, you look back down to the sideline and you see your team, your brothers coming towards you and they lift you up on their shoulders and in that moment you feel like your the king of the world. This is what goes through your head as you hear your principal inform the whole school that everyone has to participate in a extracurricular activity. I agree that everyone should have to participate in a activity because there are so many good things that can come from them. Here are some reasons I suggest that it is vital for someone to participate in a extracurricular activity.

Leadership is one of the most used traits people use it is vary important in your everyday life and in general it's a good character trait to have. First things first you need leadership skills in school let's say your put into a group with some people for a group project. Subsequently, no one is motivated to do any work so you take the reins and you jump right in and you start assigning people objectives to meet. With your leadership skills your group gets an A+ for the project all because you took charge. Another reason leadership is important is in sports if you play a position like me goalie, you always have to be controlling the defense or say your the quarterback of the football team you have to be able to communicate with the team and tell them the plays and control the offense. Most important of them all is when your an adult and you have to mange a small group of workers, you assign a worker project to complete by next week. That worker doesn't turn the project in on time and your boss gets mad at you because you were supposed to be managing it and making sure it is done on time.

Having friends in Middle School and High School are important for every kid, teen, and even adults. New kids struggle every day trying to make friends with others and people have already been friends for 3 year now. A great way for people to make friends with people is through extracurricular activities. Because, the new person and the people in the club or sport share the same interests they have a way to talk to each other. When I first moved to Generic_School I had no clue who any of these people were but, when football season came around and I signed up my team became my second family I knew them like brothers and we stayed together for years.

Some parents won't be happy with the change to their kids schedule but, that is expected when you are making kids do stuff that is new to them. But, when you look at major cities like New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan extracurricular actives are changing their cities for the better. It's keeping the kids off the streets and they are less likely to have been roped into gang related activities. Even kids mortality rate has dropped rapidly since cities have implemented rules that make kids join sports teams or clubs. That shows that making kids do extracurricular activates has helped kids in bad areas stay safe and have a higher chance of making something of their lives.

In this passage I have presented you with some reasons I agree that is vital for schools to implement the rule that all students have to participate in extracurricular activities. This rule will forever change schools in the up and coming years for the better. I suggest that all schools should have this rule implemented for safety and to help their kids build social skills, leadership skills for them to use in their futures. This rule would show kids competitive environments because that's what it is like in the real world.
