I am definitely against this proposal to the school. I think it would be very wrong to have only the students that have a B average play sports. Sports should be for everyone, but, I do think you should lower the standard's for the school, only because you don't have to be smart to play a professional sport when you grow up, so it's just like your giving the not-so-smart kids no kind of chance. They may be really good at sports. I think they should have to have a C- average. Just to give everyone I chance in doing a sport. Or set a specific grade point average, like my school does, you have to have a 2.0 or over to play a sport. Which I think is perfectly fine. We have really good players. And plus, maybe the really smart students aren't that good at football, or basketball, or other sports. Maybe they have more important stuff to do then practice, like homework. That's why I think you should lower your standards, or just set a specific grade point average because it wouldn't be fair to the kids that are really good, but don't do that well in school. Maybe they just have personal issues, or something. You shouldn't exclude them from any sport activities. Maybe they'll go pro one day. If you only let the B average students play the under average students may have nothing to look forward too. Maybe the only thing they looked forward to is sports.
