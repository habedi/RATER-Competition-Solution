My school is adding a rule. the rule is every one needs to play a type of sport or needs to do something related like help around the school. I agree on this because the teachers often get tired of teaching and will do more for the school activities. Most students don't do any activities at home and can develop hobbies by helping around the school. Also the teachers may not think of good,fun ideas so the students can get creative on the activities. The students can also plan any dances coming up or can come up with some type of events that are coming up for the school.

There are teachers that work all day and get home till every one leaves the school and if she got chosen to be a helper around the school she would get home even more late then usual. Teachers are very hardworking and always get exhausted while teaching cause she is talking all day. The students are basically helping cause they are taking out time of there day to some activities at there school. Teachers dont need to do as much work as they normally do and the students can help them at anything cause its a activity to help around the school.

There are a lot of students that dont do any activities at home and can maybe help around the school rather than be at home and do nothing. There are many students that are not athletic than other people and cant do many sports because they are not fit for the sport or dosen't ant to get hurt. Helping around the school cant get any body hurt. They can also help the school by improving it by adding some new things to the school. They can interact with people if they are always going to be at the school. they can develop some type of hobbie just by helping around the school.

They students can also create some fun ideas for the school cause they may be more open minded. The students can plan some upcoming events for the school cause that may have more fun and better ideas than teachers. There are more students that can come up with some GOOD ideas for dances,any type of upcoming events. Many teachers cant come up with fun ideas cause they dont know what type of music we like neither food.

I agreed because there arent as many students that do stuff at home or just dont like doing any activities. There are many teachers that often get more tired than others so which means the students can do some work for them if needed or just help around the school not just the teachers. The students can make the school have a better name because of the sportsman ship they are having.
