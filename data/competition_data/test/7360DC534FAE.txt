My position on driverless cars are that they would be very efficent but would also have negative outcomes as everything does. I would be for driverless cars because i think that the pros of the driverless cars would outshine the cons of it. When it comes to technology there are always going to be negative and positive outcomes to things its just about how much more positive than negative it is.

As stated in the artical it would be very useful to prevent accidents and help drivers that arent in full control of there vehicle yet to learn how to better drive on the road. The rear veiw cameras that have been made to help cars notice when they are abou to hit something is a good start to helping people that might not pay as much attention as others but it can also be negative in other ways. The traffic jam assist could be useful as well as it helps people that are stuck in traffic maybe in busy cities or on a road where an accident has occured

To conclude i think that it would be a good idea and i fully support the driverless cars while also being aware of the downsides to them and trying to work around them. It all comes down to the laws and how the government can make our streets safer for our generation now and future generations.
