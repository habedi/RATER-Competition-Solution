Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to tell you that if you change the school policy to make it impossible to participate in sports or other activities without a B average then school activities will become a thing that only a group of people will get to enjoy. Many of the students have lower than a B average and I think it is unfair to only let a few people participate in activities when the majority can't. I think that if the majority had a B average or above then it would be fine, but to exclude most of the students is just not right in my book.

I think the school's activities should be open to anyone who wants to join. This brings many different people together where they can learn from each other and learn new things. In conclusion, I think that making this policy would keep many children in the dark, missing out on fun experiences just because someone else gets better grades than them.

Sincerely,
