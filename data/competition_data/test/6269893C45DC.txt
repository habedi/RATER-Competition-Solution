I think the summer projects should be student designed. If its student designed theres endless amounts of things to do with the projects. Students will have fun with these projects and they'll have fun creating them. Here is why it think it should be student designed.

Students have a wide sense of imagination and giving them an opportunity to do something like this is a great way of showing it. These projects give teachers the chance to see students be creative while still learning how to do things. Students love doing projects it gives them the chance to be interactive and it helps them make new friends. Projects lets students and teachers try something new. Students will have a lot of fun making these projects and so will teachers. Every opportunity Students and teachers get to do a project they have fun, so why not let students try to make their own projects to see if its something that can happen every now and then.

These projects will give teachers the opportunity to see how much the students have learned over the course of the school year. For example, lets say the projects is on the renaissance students get to show what they learned during that portion of the year. Students will make a the work fun and maybe even the teachers will have fun with the projects too. Projects are already a lot of fun but students making their own projects will be a great thing for students and teachers. Teachers and students will get a chance to socialize and learn something new. Teachers won't let students show their creativity.

To summarize, I think that the projects should be student made. It gives a chance for growth and development for the students. Students will have a huge opportunity to show what they've learned during the school year. Seeing students do this really does show how much they've developed the past school year. So therefore it should be student made and not teacher made because some teachers aren't fun.
