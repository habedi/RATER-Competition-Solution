In 1976, a NASA Mars Globe surveyor called Viking 1 took a picture of an area on Mars that looked like a face. Although some believe the Face was created by aliens, I believe it is a natural landform because the pictures provide visual evidence, it would prove there is life on other planets, and it would bring in money for NASA.

NASA has taken 3 pictures. The first one taken in 1976 looked most like a face, but NASA said that it was the planet's "unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." A second picture was taken on April 5, 1998 that was ten times sharper than the original picture taken by Viking 1. Web surfers were dissapointed to see a natural landform. The unsatisfied viewers claimed that the whispy clouds hid the alien markings on the Face. April 8, 2001, on a cloudless summer day, they took a picture with each pixel spanning 1.56 meters compared to the previous 43 meters per pixel. The new picture revealed exactly what NASA claimed the Face to be, a mesa.

The discovery of life outside of Earth would be exciting. It would provide a chance to exchange scientific knowlege and possibly food or animals. It could also reveal new technologies that could put the world years further than it would be without this help. This excange could change both planets for the better and improve the lives of all species. NASA wouldn't pass up this chance to better the planet.

Some conspiracy theorists may claim, "The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA wold rather hide." This is untrue because the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization because it would bring in more money. This could be spent on new technology that could lead to new discoverys in space.

This proves that the Face on Mars was not caused by aliens. It is a natural landform that is claimed to look like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is about the same height as the Face on Mars. If an alien civilazation were discovered, though, we would not pass up the opportunity to change both our world and the aliens' world for the better.
