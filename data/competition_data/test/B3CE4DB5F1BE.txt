Having driverless cars will be insanely dangerous. It's understandable that many comanys want to make this type of car because, well, it's 2016. The future is now, but there's a very important reason why they haven't come out, and that's becuase of how dangerous they are. Also the cost of the creation of a driverless car that is safe will be beyond the imagination.

Starting of, In 2013, BMW started developing "Traffic Jam Assistant", on paragraph 7 it states that the car speeds up to 25 mph, but it has special sensors that make sure the driver is still holding to the wheel. It's like that for the majority of smart cars. The cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, yet they still require human assistance. These companys can make as many "driverless" cars as they need but none of the ones that have been developed so far have worked as 100% driverless.

Secondly, these producers often don't realize that it's not only expirienced adults that are going to be driving thsese cars, but teenagers too. Teenagers aren't the most smart when it comes to safety on the roads. They have their friends, phones, radio, any type of distraction and now they also have to worry about if the driverless car is going to need the help of a human?

Finally , technology is unexpected. We've al seen the movies, and all though they are fiction, it can definitely happen. No on egetting in their driverless car cna know if the technology will fail while the driver is in a busy road or if it'll act up when leats expected. It is a very dangerouse situation if your driverless car suddenly syops an dyou don't understand why. There's already a million things that can go wrong with regular cars, now imagine the things that could happen in a car that you, yourself aren't even in control of.

Driverless cars are very dangerous. There's not a way possible that a teenager could handel that much responsability. The driverless cars will not ever be 100% just the car, they will always need human help. Everything could go wrong with technology. Tesla has projected a release this year for a car capable of driving an autopilot 90% of the time, as said on paragraph 10. Audi, and Nissan are planning to have a car that can drive itself by 2020, the future is now.
