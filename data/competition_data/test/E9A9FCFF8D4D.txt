I (being Luke) think that you should be a seagoing cowboy. It is a fun experience to have in your life. Plus you do not get chance like this very often in your life. It is great fun. Here are some reasons you should join me:

If you like helping others you should join. Thats basicly all we do. We as Seagoing cowboys ship or trans port animals to other countries in need. We partern up with UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) which by the way is an awesome team. That is one of the main reasons why I joined.

One other reason is that you get to see the marvels of the world. Like Greece. That place was sure amazing. You get so much extra time after you deliver the cattle.

Another reason is that all that free time my crew and I play games and such during our free time as well. That means that you bond together and have life-long friends that will always be there for you.

I know this speech is long but I have one more thing to say. That if you are an animal lover than this is the job for you. You get to be with animals 24/7. It is a dream-come-ture for animal lovers.
