Wouldn't it be awesome to always have something to do at the end of a long boring school day. Extracurricular activities give you that chance. I believe that everyone should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity every school year. I think this because of all the benefits. Also, every extracurricular activity has a different advantage. The extracurricular activities I think everyone should be a part of are: sports, academic, and different clubs.

The first, and my personal favorite, extracurricular activity is sports teams. Sports teams create a way for kids to get exercise. Kids are recommended to exercise 60 minutes each day. Joining a sports team ensures that you reach that goal. Not only would it be healthy, but the student would feel good about him/herself. Teamwork is also and benefit to joining a sports team. Teamwork is one of the most important skills. It's one of the the only skills people absolutely need to be successful in life. Sports teams are one of the best ways to practice and get better at that skill. Another skill acquired in sports teams is leadership. In sports teams leadership is always a reoccurring skill. You also need to show leadership throughout you life, similar to teamwork. Some may be a bit shy and not necessarily know how to correctly take a lead in situations, but sports teams could definitely fix that. To think this is only one of the types of extracurricular activities to choose from, doesn't it already seem worth your time?

The next option for an extracurricular activity is the academic workshops you're able to join. Academic workshops and clubs can push students to do better. In these academic workshops you surround yourself with people who want to be better, and are better than you. Surrounding yourself with people who are better than you encourages you to do better for yourself and pride. Academic workshops may also improve your grades a little or a lot depending on how dedicated you are to do so. There are workshops like homework club that help students who need a little more help and guidance than others. If these particular students participate in these types of things, they're sure to see and improvement anytime soon.

Lastly, there are so many different types of clubs any student could be a part of and interested in. Everybody should try something new every once in a while. The different clubs that schools have are the perfect opportunity. I'm going to introduce you to two of the clubs that sparked my interest. First is the yearbook club. Doesn't it just sound fun by its name? Wouldn't you want to be a part of the book that everyone raves about at the end of the year? You get to take pictures, make fun subtitles/caption, and so much more. Sometimes you even get extra credit for it. Seems like a deal breaker to me. Then there's student council. This is probably my favorite clubs to be a part of. It's very intriguing to see what it's like to be somewhat of a politician. Student council is also an awesome opportunity to show your teamwork and leadership skills strengthened by sports teams. Besides, wouldn't it be fun to basically be at the head of the school. Think about it, these are just two of the hundreds of clubs you're able to choose from.

I believe every student should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity. Sports teams help push exercise, and strengthen teamwork and leadership. Academic workshops encourage better grades and motivates students to do better. There are also opportunities for student to try new things with the different types of clubs. Think of how well rounded a student would be by participating in one of these extracurricular activities every school year.
