Although driverless cars present some benefits they also bring up big issues. Such as driveless car aren't entirely driverless, they are not reliable and create legal problems.

A driverless car is not driverless which means that the driver will have to be alert to still be able to take over the wheel when pulling in and out of driveways or overseeing traffic problems like work zones and accidents.

Another issue driverless cars present is that it is illegal to test computer driven cars in some states. How can anyone be sure that driverless cars are safe if they can't be tested. What if the car's technology were to fail and someone getting injured. This also ties in with

Legal issues that will produce more conflict, for example who would cover liablility if there were to be an accident. In additon to that who's fault would it be the "driver" or the manufacurer?

So as you see driverless cars present issues of not being entirely driverless, they can not be totally reliable and safe, and create legal issues.
