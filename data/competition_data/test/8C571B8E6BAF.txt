There are some days where getting out of bed can be incredibly difficult. A sick individual could find it very hard to attend school and would benefit greatly from attending classes online. Online learning is a very simple and beneficial way to learn. Students can take their time and work at whatever pace feels the most comfortable to them and they can take however long they need to work on their classwork without the class moving too fast or too slow. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students would be able manage their own time, students would be able to attend classes with better attendance, and students would be able to work with less stress.

One of the main ways students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that students will have more freedom and students will be able to better management their time. The pace of some "in person" classes can be too fast or even too slow for some students. With online classes, students can freely manage their time and work however and whenever they want. Students could benefit greatly from online classes because instead of having a set amount of time, such as an hour, to work on classwork, students could manage their time and use the entire day to work at a comfortable pace. Students have lives outside of school as well. Most students need time in their day to attend an extracurricular or a sport that they play, and sometimes, school can take that time away from individuals. With online classes, students can stop working at any given time to attend activities such as a swim practice or a robotics meeting and continue their work after. Students are often very busy and would greatly benefit from attending classes online because students gain the ability manage their time themselves.

Another way students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that students will have better attendance. A student could be extremely sick and be forced to miss important classes which could be detrimental to their learning experience. Being able to attend classes online could greatly benefit individuals who can't attend class in person by granting students access to their material from anywhere at any given time. Instead of being forced to miss a few days of school, students can attend classes from home and not miss out on important information. In some cases, students have to leave school early or attend school at a later time because of an appointment or because of an emergency. During times where students have to miss parts of a school day, students can make up work and learn anything that they missed themselves. Instead of taking another class period to relearn something that an individual missed, they can work at home at home and catch up without having to miss more classes. There are situations where it's impossible for students to attend school; and in those situations, students would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes at home because it allows for more freedom in their schedule to attend classes.

The last way students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that students will be less stressed. Students can very easily stress out due to an upcoming due date or having to turn in incomplete work. Online classes can relieve this stress in many ways, such as allowing for a less harsh due date. For example instead of forcing a research paper to be due the next class in order to keep up with a schedule, students could have an extra day or two to work on their research paper. Another way online classes can relieve stress is by allowing students to keep up with the class easier. In some schedules, students only attend a certain class every other day. With online classes, instead of having the possibility of falling behind very quickly, students will have an extra day to work and learn new material. It is very easy for students to be stressed as the school year comes to an end. This is the time where students start to take their final exams and start cramming in their work. It can be extremely stressful for some individuals especially during times where there is an emergency and school have to shut down. With online classes, students won't fall behind and fail their coming exams, instead, students will still be able to learn new material and practice new material at home to better prepare themselves for the future. Online classes can be treated as more class time that can benefit students by allowing more work time and allow for less stress on things like a due date approaching rapidly or a final exam date approaching rapidly.

There are a few downsides to online learning such as a temporary outage that could prevent students from learning from home. But that downside is a small trade off for what attending classes from home can provide. Students can gain the much needed flexibility to their schedule and be able to manage how they work and when they work by attending classes from home. Students will have a harder time missing school due to an emergency or due to a sickness that could prevent them from going school because online learning can provide students with access to all the classes they need from anywhere. Instead of having to worry about not understanding something and having to stress about it, online learning can provide the same material given in class, outside of class as well. Not only is being able to attend classes from home something extremely beneficial to students, it is also a step towards a better learning experience for everyone.
