Many school have offered students the option to work from home, do you think that's a good idea? Here's why its not. Many students need hands on help not only for them to understand the subject but for them to learn it properly. Also students may or may not have access to online learning maybe they live to far or have not so good service to communicate. Schools also help teach students how to interact with other, teaching them good social habits

Most students need one on one help understanding the concept of the subject being taught. For example, math is known to be a hard subject if not taught properly, so if you were to work from home there would be a lot of confusion and questions unanswered. When in schools students can get as much help as they need, get questions and concerns answered and understand better.

Some students actually would rather stay in schools where everything such as text books, Wifi, paper, and pencils are supplied for them. Students who live off grid or to far to get service would have a tough time getting information on the subject. For illustration, more then 15% of students live in wooded areas, hills and mountains with barely any service, just imagine the struggle of finding the right spot to sit in for about seven in a half hours.

Some schools think having students work from home is a good idea, but not realizing most students require extra help or they just dont have the connection to do the work. Not to mention that school actually teach more then they know like social interaction. Students should stay in schools to learn.
