Dear Principal,

Regarding the cell phone policy at school, I think you should use the first policy. I think the first policy, "allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time," would be an excellent choice because students might need their phones for emergencies at some point in the day and it would be good to be able to call their parent or guardian if they needed something prominent.

For example, say a girl student named RELATIVE_NAME

were to forget her P.E. clothes at the beginning of the week and she wanted to get a good grade. She could call her parent or guardian and ask them to bring her clothes for P.E. She would then get a great grade for participating and being prepared. Now say if she didn't have her clothes, she wouldn't have been able to participate because she wasn't prepared, and would then get a zero for a grade.

Another reason why this policy would be best is most students are bound to have their phones on them anyway so it wouldn't hurt much. The only problem with picking the first policy is that because the students know they are allowed to have their phones on them, powered off, however, is a different story. Knowing they're allowed to have their phones will increase the chance of them texting in class, when they're not supposed to because they have it with them and they will be tempted to use it to text their friend sitting right next to them. The only way to ever stop this is almost impossible. Which is why choosing this policy won't hurt much. Students will always be tempted to text in class so it won't really matter whether or not they're allowed to have their phone with them.

Once again, the policy I believe you should choose is Policy #1. You should choose this policy because students may need something for school or their might be an emergency so they can call their parent or guardian. Also, students are and will already be tempted to text during class because in most cases, they have their phones on them anyway so it will not change much except give the students a chance to call their parent or guardian for an emergency. That is why you should choose Policy #1.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
