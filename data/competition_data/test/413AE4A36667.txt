Ever thought of how clubs could benefit people in any sort of way possible? Like how does it help people rather than waste their time? Well, joining clubs are actually extremely helpful to students. They should participate in extracurricular activities because it teaches them life skills, helps them manage their time, and it helps with their stress.

Joining an club can teach these students many different life skills, such as teamwork. Teamwork is not something everyone learns throughout their lives. Some people are taught by their parents, but most of the time, teamwork is taught to people who experience it. Extracurricular activities often teach people how to succeed by working together. They teach it by forcing the students, in a good way, to work together. This is important because teamwork is a life lesson people must learn to excel in life. What I mean by that is, humans wouldnt even been alive if there wasnt someone there to help them. People work together in ways to create amazing inventions because of it. For example, if cavemen hadn't worked together to hunt for food, then we would've not even be here on this Earth. Teamwork was in the human nature long before any of us were alive, and it has proven to have advance the human race in all ways possible.

Participating in extracurricular actives require a lot of time management and responsibility. This is a great for students because many dont learn how to manage their time correctly. Managing time is probably the hardest skill to learn. It requires planning, and actually doing what was planned, and most of us would forget that we even had something up in our calender if not for time management. Having an activity can help get us to realize to keep track of time. How? By making people panic when they forget about the club that they signed up for. Time management also teaches the students responsibility. It teaches students responsibility by having them keep track of what they are doing next, and how much time to take on it. By participating in a club, it can help students become more responsible.

Aside from responsibility, reducing stress is also another one of the major point to join a club.

Stress takes a major part in a students life,but it also acts as a major issue for a lot of students' health. Many would get rid of stress by surfing the internet or sleeping. But isn't that just a major waste of time? Instead, they could join clubs that actually benefits then, rather than waste their lives. Joining a club can majorly benefit a students health by taking off all that stress.

Activities such as sports or student council can help take their mind off of things, and just let them focus and have fun. It is proven that clubs help students to manage their stress through activities and games.

Reducing stress could also help with the students' concentration on other things. Without stressful thoughts, students can concentrate better on school work after they finished their club's.

In the end, joining a club or an activity is very beneficial to students. Extracurricular activities could teach students' teamwork by working together with other people. It can also help them by helping them manage their time and teach them responsibility. Joining an activity can help deal with a lot of stress, and help the students' concentrate better on school work. In the future, many schools will enforce a requirement; stating that students absolutely have to join a extracirruclar activity, because it benefits them a lot.
