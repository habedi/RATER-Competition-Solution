I personally do not like the idea of having driverless cars.

I believe there are many reasons to avoid creating cars that are driverless or in other words, automatic.

I understand there are some positve outcomes of having driverless vehicles, but I feel the negative outcomes override the positive outcomes in this particular situation.

Because the negative outcome are far more than the positve outcomes over having driverless cars, I do not agree on the fact that we should use driverless cars in our everyday lifestyle.

One negative outcome of using driverless cars is how potentially dangerous these automatic vehicles could be.

New technologies are always risky because we do not always know what could malfunction.

Malfunctions of new technologies are very common.

I think there would be many vehicle malfunctions due to the technology that has not been allowed to test fully.

In this case, I do not think a new car is worth the risks that would proceed a technology malfunction.

Creating this new car could potentially risk many lives of the people riding in the car.

I do not believe risking the life a person would be worth a driverless car.

Another negative thing about driverless cars is how expensive creating the driverless cars would be.

The expense of these new and improved driverless vehicles would be ridiculously high.

In my opinion, I do not think such high amount of money would be worth having an automatic car.

I feel the current cars we drive are doing the job they need to do.

I think it would be a waste of money to make these driverless cars when we already have cars that do what they need to do.

Driverless cars may not be equipped for every possible occurence.

Because the driverless cars are automatic, I do not think they would be programmed for everything that could happen in real world situations.

In the real world, you never are really prepared for what could happen.

I think occurences in the world are completely random and unexpected.

I feel having an automatic car during these random and unexpected events are not always the best for these particular situations.

I do not think it would be safe for the people in the car even if the driverless cars were set up to where the driver would take control during these situation.

I think the best option to be safe would to have manually operated vehicles.

I do not think driverless cars are a good idea because of the negative things that would come about them.

I think there are many negative things that would come from having driverless cars.

Driverless cars would very dangerous for the people in the car.

Driverless cars would also be very expensive.

The new automatic cars would not be equipped for every situation that would be thrown in its way.

I feel like driverless cars would solve some problems we have with vehicles, but I feel they would create many more problems on the way.
