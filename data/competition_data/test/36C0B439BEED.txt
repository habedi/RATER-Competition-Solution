Summer projects are something all students know too well. Whether they are mandated by the school system, or by individual teachers, they can be hard to avoid. Even though summer should be a relaxing time away from school, these projects weasel their way into students lives and disturb the peace of summer. It is sometimes difficult for students to motivate themselves to do school work over the summer because they wish to forget about their responsibilities as a student all together. Although giving students educational freedom can be refreshing, in reality, teacher-designed projects are more efficient and beneficial.

It is best for summer projects to be teacher-designed because the students will have better guidelines that will lead them towards success. In my AP Biology class, we are often assigned projects. There was one instance where we could come up with any project we wanted with no limitations. At first I thought this was a great idea. However, when I was brainstorming ideas, I was stuck. I was afraid that whatever I came up with would not be exactly what the teacher wanted, which would have resulted in a bad grade. If this assignment was teacher designed, however, I would have felt much more confident in my finished project. If I was given the guidelines that come along with teacher-designed projects, I would have been able to manage the time I spent on this project more efficiently and I would have received a higher grade.

Teacher-designed summer projects are the best option because they are more helpful to the students. A recent study shows that students score higher on assignments that were created by the teacher than on assignments with less restraints. When students are given educational freedom, they can sometimes take it for granted. Some believe that because there are no real guidelines, they can slack off and not try their hardest. Projects given over summer break can give students an even bigger opportunity to do this because they are away from school. This amount of freedom can result in a bad grade. Clearly, this is not beneficial for students in the long run. It will lead to bad habits that can hurt their high school career.

Another reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they offer students insight to what their teacher is like, which can be beneficial when the new school year starts. Last summer I completed a photography project. This assignment was very specific, and there was an exact process for how we had to complete it. In the fall when I went to that class for the first time, I felt as if I already knew my teacher. Based on the summer project I had completed, I knew he would be very meticulous and his expectations were high. However, I was not as scared to enter his class for the first time because I already knew what the class structure would be like.

Although the modern education system has its flaws, teacher-designed projects are one of its highlights. Structure in the classroom--whether it be during the school year or over the summer--is always best. It allows students to use their time in a way that is more manageable and beneficial to them. Keeping this structure will allow students educational careers to be successful, which in the long run, is what school is all about.
