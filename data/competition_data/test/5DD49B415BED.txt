Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think community service is a wonderful thing for the people and for the community. In my opinion i do think community service should be required, because it gives kids in the community rights to straighten up and learn to act mature around other citizens. It will cause a less amount of labor for older citizens in the Frisco community. Also it will get several of amounts of work and jobs done.

For the punks that slack off in class and don't do what their supposed to do or told to do it will also give them something to do instead of slack off by the TV all day and play video game. I've always thought community service was a good thing for the trouble makers and just for the kids that want to be responsible in their young life future.

Almost my whole life i have tried to teach people how to have good manners and how to act mature. Community service is by far the way to role. Community service is already required for the citizens that choose to make the wrong choices and slack off.

why not just make it for everyone. It will give a person something to do and go on their record of time made up. Because if you don't already know the thugs and punks in this world that make bad choices usually end up regretful and don't succeed in life, and end up working off at gas stations with no money in their bank

For the humans that don't need it but might want it give it to them and let them be a top leader in life for people to follow as a role model. Community service for everyone!!!
