Dear Mr. Principle

I think, in my case, that children should not have to community service if they don't want to. it's my opinion that if children don't want to do something they shouldn't have to. isn't that what our country is built on.

freedom to do what ever you like. we are the country of love, peace, and happiness. "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" we will always have these options. and if community service doesn't make you happy, then i guess we don't have our rights.

What if the teachers give you a lot of work one night and you don't have time to do community service. or your little brother, who just loves and adores you, has a little league base ball game and you miss it to go to do community service, and during that game he hits a home run and when he gets to first base he looks back for his big brother to cheer him on and guess who isn't there. So the little brother stops turns and cry's away. you've just made a little boy cry by making his brother do something he doesn't like to do.

If peoples hobbies are to do community services then I am fine with that. Good job for them. They are probable smartest people in the school and learning comes easy to them then that's good for them. People like me, we have to work to get what we want, we just cant think of something randomly and make us famous. We have to work really hard. and if i am forced to do community service that takes away from study time and i fail a class, guess who's shoulders that rests on. Yours.
