You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you would be helping animals get to other countries, you would be able to visit exciting places and countries and you woudn't have to be bored on the ship because you can do fun activities. I have to arn you, you might face dangerous situations.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you would be helping animals that weres shipped overseas. You would be helping animals such as horses, young cows and mules. You would be feeding the animals, giving them water clean their stalls and you would have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats to the lower holds of the ship. If you join the program you would also be able to visit exciting places and countries, I got to visit the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Some places I visited were Europe, China, Greece, Italy and Crete. One of the most exciting things I have ever done was when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Itlay. Another reason why you should join is because, when you're on the ship you get to do activities such as playing baseball, volleyball, Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and if you want you can read.

I have to warn you, you could get hurt because when I was aboard on the ship one day, I slid down a slippery laddery on my backside, my heart raced as I shot feet towards an openingon the side of the ship. Luckilly a small strip of metal along the edge of the ship stopped me from sliding and keept me from flying aboard into the Atlantic Ocean. I was happy to be alive, but I couldn't work for a couple of days because I had cracked ribs. Even though you might face some dangerous situations when you join this program you still get to, help animals, visit exciting places and countries and do fun activities while you are on the ship. Please join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you would be doing a good thing and your family and friends would be proud that you are helping animals and the community.
