Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning on their break. The question now is should those projects be teacher designed or student designed.? The most logical thing to do would be to have the teachers design the projects because they will be the ones grading the projects,their the the ones who know what we should and shouldn't know yet, and as long as students are working so should teachers.

The benefit of having a teacher making a project for students instead of students making projects for students is that students would ether make it way to hard on themselves or way to easy. Students would need a teacher to hit that sweet spot for them so they only have to worry about doing there work. It would be easy for the teacher too because then everybody's project would be the same format for grading.

Teachers have been doing there jobs for years now and have a general understanding of what knowledge students should retain over their breaks. This is why they should be making the projects not students. We would be getting so much more out of it if the teachers designed the projects.

Many students get jobs in the summer because they cant during the school year due to the fact there at school all day, and the second they get out its hours on top of hours of homework. If we were to make students design their own projects and do them and have a normal break we would be asking the impossible from most students, this is why students would need teacher help.

In conclusion students would absolutely need teachers to be the ones to design the summer projects because of their background in Teaching, education, grading, and assignment making talents. teachers also have summers off so they would have plenty of time for all of this.
