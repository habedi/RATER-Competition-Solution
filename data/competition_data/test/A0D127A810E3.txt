Dear Principal,

I am here writing because due to the fact that i have heard that you was considering changing where you had to at least have a 80 (b) average in every class to continue to play sports. Many kids a 70 (c) in every class, i am auguring because of the displacement of spots if you go through with this change. The I and the other students althelets try so very hard to keep are grades up! I would also like to state that they are not failing there classes...

Also on the other hand i am actually for that conderation, I would like to see all the test scores go up, and are school be one of the leading education centers of our country and sournding area in are State.. Well there are many thing we need to change about this school and stating with this will be great.. I really think that is the Change of a life time...

Sincerely yours,
