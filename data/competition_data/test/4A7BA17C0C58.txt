Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home. Taking classes from home can affect the students learning abilities because they will procrastinate with their school work,

More students will start to fail, and there could be a higher cheating rate with the online classes. Online classes are not a great idea for students who have not graduated yet. Students are still developing when they are in high schoolÂ and they do not start to become mature until they are in college. Studies show that students would not benefit with the online classes because it explains how students are more likely to start failing while taking online classes because they will procrastinate with their school work, more students will start to fail from not being serious with the classes and there is a higher cheating rate with taking online classes.

For example, students will easily procrastinate with their work that is just how kids are, they will easily get distracted with hanging out with friends or wanting to play on their phones for hours a day and then they will never have the energy to get their work done. Students can easily find other things to do just so they do not have to do their school work, especially if they are online classes. The students will more then likely not take these online classes as serious as they should and it can really effect them .

However, there would be a variety of students to start failing these classes because most students do not have access to internet at their homes. Studies show that they will start to see a drop in the students grades because if the teacher posts the lessons online, some of the students will not be able to watch the lessons due to them not having any internet access or the students would just not take the time out of their day to watch the lessons and will start to fall behind in the class that they are in because students rather do other activities then learn.

This leads to having a higher cheating rate. Students rather cheat and take the easy way out instead of actually taking the time and learning something new, and with that case taking online classes can easily lead to the students being able to cheat very easy. For example, most of the work for the online classes are basically all online and it can be very simple for the students to find all of their work on the internet. Also if students cheat then that will not help them in the future because they are not learning anything by cheating, it is basically just a faster way to get their work done instead of taking their time and doing it on their own.

On the contrary, some people may argue that doing online classes will be a great way for students to learn. They believe that if the students take the online classes then it would so much more effective for them to learn and that they will have more time to do their activities outside of school. In other words that is technically not the case for some students. Some students need to actually go to school instead of take online classes because that would be more helpful for them to learn that way.

In conclusion, taking online classes is not a great idea because the students will more than likely procrastinate with their classes and the school work, more students will start to fail the classes, and last there could be a higher rate for cheating while taking online classes. Studies show that the best way for students to learn is actually when they go to school and get hands on learning from a teacher rather then learning from someone talking over the computer. So in other words taking online classes will not benefit the students with their learning abilities.
