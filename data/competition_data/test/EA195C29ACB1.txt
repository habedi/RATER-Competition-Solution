The school system says we as students should all do some type of school related work during the summer in order to still have the knowledge of the things we learned during the time we was in school. including school projects, I do beleive that the school assignments that are givien should be student designed because in fact they are giving the work to us. The teachers already gives us alot of assgiments that are dessigned by teachers and their department maybe for once its time to give us a chance to let the projects be on us and up to our knowledge , even though the summer is really suppose to be about our summer vacation because we did just come from school and finished our requirements, the summer is really just a break for student to relax and getting your mind off school but I do agree that we should still do work and try to at least read once in a while so we dont go back to school during end of August or Septmeber and we clueless, reasons of why the summer projects should be student designed is because students may have ideas that teacher dont think about giving and belelive it or not these students can be very creative sometimes and come up with really excting ideas for projects with that being said they should be school educational wise , with the purpose of the summer projects being designed by students it's a better way of showing the teachers and the school education department that we have been learning in school what we need to know for an example when a student is doing their assignment and they include , context clue , details , strong vocabulary words and the unit basis of what we have learned in school. Coming to the next grade level it will show teachers that so far we have learned the right curriculum and the reached the standards because it will be presented in that presentation or that project assignment by the students who are doing it on their summer vacation however , if it were to be teacher designed because teachers are looking for specific portions of what they have learned during out the school year and on books they have read then I would understand why it would be that way even thought its taking out the purpose of a students own ability to do work on what they want to work on like me being in that position I would absolute take student designing the summmer projects for an answer.

I would brianstorm with all my ideas for example ; the way i used math this summer when i went out and helped my father at his job because his back was injured i can definetly write out how i used some math learining skills and I can also write out the trips i went to and wrote essays about how it went and the stops we made thats a skill of writing and perhaps even reading , the more vacations and trips the longer my essays can be , of course it has to be educational wise so i will add some puncuations and maybe even the vocabulary that i learned during english class , it will show that not only do i remember what i was doing in school but I will also be preparing myself for next year I will have more practice and knowledge and try to fit in a litte bit of history in there as well like what's going on with my family and the government and how my grandma is sick so we trying to bring her here to stay with us for a while but because of the new rules in the United States , there's just some things we aren't allowed to accomplish no matter how bad we want her here and take care of her , I can definently make a project in how the government has these new rules that affects others and their familes like mine , that would be a example of me being in the postion as to it being student designed so I can personally write about how my life is going with that being said I would have to make the projects relate to school and the things we learned and of course that can be easy because there's alot of things we learn in school that can help us out later in life and when we look at a situation we see the things we been taught to prepare us in becoming adults I still til this day come home telling my parents something new that I've learned and at least try to help like when my mother lost her job and I was sitting in econ and finance and listening to my teacher tell us the things we can come off of when your in a situation like my mother when she was fired and was on a contract but because the business was low my mom was took out , teachers teach you alot about life and how you want to be ready and some students take it as a joke and others think into it and see a lot of sitiations like it when they come home and their parents having their own problems those are things we learn in school and when we have a chance to decide on our ideas. I think it's best as coming up with good thoughts on how around the places you travel or even in your own household there is school knowledge.

things we learn in school students can relate to and may or may not affect them at home . When we're out of school we go home and have a long summer break and as we start to think of the things we've been taught in school we living in it and that's our future , that being said I do think students should be giving the opportuinty to decide on what they want to present there project on in the condtions of it being school educational purposes and to show how they not forgetting what students learning in school. A project in the summer especially when it's our free time, our vacation, it's time to let us students show the teachers what we know and learned from them and how we can relate to it when we are actually living in it, when we learn in school we have all this knowlege and the standards in each subject we're being taught gettting us ready when we become adults ourself. letting it be teacher-designed will only cover what a teacher expects from us. Us as students have way more to show what we know and what we keep in with us as we are being taught different lessons in each subject.
