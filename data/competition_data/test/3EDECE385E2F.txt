To whom it may concern:

I don't think that changing the school policy about having a B average to participate in sports is fair. Some students who participate in sports sometimes have a challenging class and requires lots of time on their homework. We know that taking on a sport means that you will need to balance your homework and the sport you're taking on but having a C average is pretty good if you're participating in a sport because your juggling your sport, homework, family and friends. Especially, us teens, we always want to go hang out or do something fun. If the policy changes to where you need to average a B, then it's going to be hard to the students because if they are super focused on school, they wont be focused during the game. If the student is focused on the sport, they wont focus on schoolwork so having a C average or higher is good for them.

I can relate to how some students would feel if you would change the policy because when I was in 6th grade, I had to find time for basketball, another basketball league outside of school, friends and schoolwork. I know it's my responsibility to do all of it but it was pretty stressful and I was only in 6th grade. If you wish to keep the policy, our students who are participating in a sport would benefit them because it would allow them to focus on the sport they love and schoolwork.

If you do not wish to keep the policy and change it, students wouldn't really benefit from it but would just make them more focused. I am not saying that being focused is bad but soon, students will get tired of the routine of: Going to school, practice, homework , shower, and sleep. Then they will stop doing sports and wouldn't be active , and become lazy. They also wont have time for their family because they are too focused on their grades. But maybe for some students it will help them push harder on their schoolwork.

Sincerely,
