Dear principle,

I do not think you should change the school requirement grade to play sports to a B average.

I don't think that would be fair because not every student gets all A, and they mite want to play school sports but they couldn't if they don't have at least a B average. students might be struggling in school because of the problems they are having at home. Sports would be a good way to take their mind off all of there problems and just play and have fun instead of worrying about the problems they're having. Now i think students need to have good grades because they are a student athlete, but I don't think you should have to have a B average. I think you should have to be passing all your classes at least to be able to play sports in school. If some students aren't allowed to play sports and they're having problems at home, that mite cause them to get into some kind of trouble. If they are allowed to play sports with passing grades that could help some students to stay out of trouble and not worry about all the problems they're having. Some students really enjoy sports but are taking higher level classes and they might not be able to get an A or B in that class.

That would make the student mad because they tried hard they just didn't make a B in that class and they wouldn't be able to play sports because of that one grade and they really enjoyed sports. So I don't think students should have to have a B average to play sports. I think that would just be un fair.
