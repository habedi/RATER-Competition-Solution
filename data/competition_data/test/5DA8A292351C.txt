Dear Principle,

As you stated in the first written policy , I think students should be allowed to use their cellular phones during social times like Lunch. I think that is a reasonable policy.

As long as the phones are shut off during learning times it should be permitted.

In school students can only communicate with those that are around them, but it is fair to say that not all students find the company of their fellow classmates enough to entertain them. Therefore students should be allowed to use cell phones which allow them to connect with other people they know and may share more things in common with.

Its nice to be able t have options for who you want to associate with during your free time. And cell phones widen the options of people you can communicate with.

Its not just a beneficial thing for students, but also to the parents of those children and family members. To be able to call your child during school to inform or remind them about something that may be personal is far better than having to call a school phone to speak to your child. There are pros and cons for having an available time set for people to use their phones. Things such as students not communicating with the people around them as much because they're too absorbed into their technology. Its a common case for young people today to get caught up into their phones and the internet and etc, but its their decision on how they should spend their time and we should grant them the opportunity to choose how they spend their social time. It feels good to have options.

As long as students are still able to learn and keep focused at the times needed in class, then cell phone usage should be fine. It'll just be a well deserved privilege for their hard work throughout the course of the year. But I do hope to see this policy take place.

Please take my word into consideration, its all that I ask. Thank you very much!

Sincerely,

(Your Student)
