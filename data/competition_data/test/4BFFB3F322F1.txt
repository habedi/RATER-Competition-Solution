The Seagoing Cowboys go on many adventures almost every day. One adventure that we have done, was we to Europe. There are many other places thta we have gone to, for example, we went to China, New Orleans, Venice, and on our way to China we went to Crete. In Crete, we toured an excavated castle. In Venice, we went gondola riding.

We also did many fun activities in our spare time. Us Cowboys play baseball and volleyball. We also had table-tennis tournaments, we fenced, boxed, read, and we played many other games. Not only do we do these activities, but we also liked to whittle.

The Seagoing Cowboys didn't just do fun activities and have adventures, but we also had many responsibilities. There are different types of responsibilities that the Seagoing Cowboys have to do. One of these responsibilities is that we all took turns nightwatching. What a nightwatcher does is they have to check on the animals every hour and make hourly reports to the captain. We also had to feed and water the animals two or three times every day.
