Have you ever had an project over the summer, and you thought what If this was student designed ? Well I defer, I truly believe that if summer projects were ran by students it will be a major mishap. There are many reasons why summer projects should not be students designed. First, because many students are not going to forget about the academic part of the project. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over their summer break. For example over the summer I had to read the maximum of six books over the summer, but I could never finish or complete my goal because I would most likely forget about reading over the summer, and I would forget what strategies to use to help me complete my goal. Finally, this why I'm siding with all projects should be teacher designed.

To begin, many students believe that summer break is not to really focus on the time frame that they have to learn or set their minds on nothing pertaining to school work or anything work academic. This is an reason why projects should not be designed by students, and I feel that teachers are going to give students strategies that pertain to what the students have learned during school hours. Also I know that teachers will give students an time frame that will allow students to complete projects, and help students focus on learning during break. I learned that many reasons why I could not complete my math goal during the summer. This was because I was not setting an time frame for myself to keep track and making sure I can reach my goal, also I would very so often forget my strategies that i used during school hours to help guide me. Next, this is why projects should be designed by teachers. I know that teachers would give us many things that will help us remember, and focus such as: notes work assignments that we have done during school hours, and also an time frame of when It can be completed.

Next, teachers providing projects I felt It would be more easier on students because students need an extra boost over the summer mainly most students would feel that they might not remember, or cant retain the information and can not complete. If teachers where to design projects for students,I know that teachers will have an due date on when and how to turn in your projects on time. This suggestion is really good for students, because If students made projects that they wouldn't know how to turn in projects, or when to finish them. My teacher makes sure her students are completing and finishing projects on this website called Schoolagly. This process is to make sure that any projects or work assignments are turned in and done correctly, And also with this process teachers can add notes and definitions that will help with projects and work assignments. To become more perplex on this topic this is the reason why students should not design summer projects,and because sometimes student wouldn't know when to complete or finish these projects.

Finally, there are many reasons to why summer projects should be made by teachers and not students. These reasons are based on the needs for students, and how some students need an teachers to help them concentrate on projects during the summer. Also so students need help from teachers to manage time frame on when to complete projects. Then students might need help from teachers on how to retain the information learned during school hours. But if it were up to most students they would look at it in a different perspective a lot of time students would want to design projects, because they believe that they have all of their materials that they will need for projects and sometimes they don't which makes it hard. Also this makes it complicated for students to make and time frame on when to finish the project,also some may need assistance with remembering what strategies they used to remember during school hours. To sum It up, I truly believe this is why teachers should make all summer projects to give students an helpful path to continue learning.

In conclusion, there are many reason why students should not design break projects. Many students are going to forget about the academic part of the projects. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over the break. This concept is really important,and also helps make sure students using the break time for projects,and has an adult that has put material down to help along the way. Teachers creating projects will also help by not letting the students to get off course during break. Just think about it would you want your students, or child to have projects over the break and not have to proper structure for thier projects?
