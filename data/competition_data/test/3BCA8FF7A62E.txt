Online Schooling, Good or Bad?

Going to school is rough. Getting up every day to to the same boring tasks. The never ending drone of teachers voices. Going through all the drama of having to deal with your peers. However, students are much better off than when they go to school like normal, than remaining at home and doing online school. If students were to stay home for school, they wouldn't be able to get the same one-on-one help that a real classroom could provide, they would have less social skills to use in the real world, and many students don't have internet or phone access to be able to attend online classes.

Firstly, if a student was having trouble understanding a subject, he would not be able to get the same level of help available to him if an instructor was sitting next to them. Some students need one-on-one help to get through difficult subjects and would feel bad about getting bad grades on a subject they were not doing well in. Teachers would have a lot less control over students in this regard. They could not be sure if a student was cheating on an assignment and have a even harder time proving it. They would also have a harder time grading students work based on the fact that they can't see the students doing the work. Because of this students would not be getting the full extent of education that they deserve.

Which leads me to my second point. Students would not be getting the same kind of social interaction with online schooling, that they get when they go to school every day, which they need in their adult lives. Human beings are social creatures and need practice interacting with peers and superiors to be able to make friends and get ready for jobs in the future. Social interaction is one of the most important skills a student can obtain. Students would lack this part of their lives if they mostly talked over the internet and not face to face with people.

This brings me to my Final point, online schooling is impossible if there is no internet of phone service for students to have access to. Depending on where they live, especially in more rural areas, some students and families may not get internet service or do not make enough money to afford it. The same ideas apply with phone service. If students only have access to a land-line they would not be able to attend these classes or would not be able to see the material that is needed for understanding. If a family did have internet access, some parents may deem it important for someone to stay at home and supervise the student to make sure they are doing the work they are supposed to be doing. Therefore losing money that could pay for the child's personal or school needs.

There are others that believe that online schooling would be very beneficial. Being at home can make some students feel a lot more secure and would promote a stronger learning environment. Some argue that if a student is disabled in some way, online schooling would be better off at home, where they could be cared for. There is also an argument for the fact that diseases spread very easily in schools, and if the student were home there would be a lot less sickness to deal with. However, the cons outweigh the pros of this type of schooling and these arguments are Inconsequential in the long run.

In conclusion, while online schooling seems nice on the surface, the trouble and problems that it would bring, such as not being able to get the right amount of help, not being having social skills to use in the future and the fact that not all students have the ability to attend online classes, makes this type of schooling impractical. There is also the fact that students would be able to cheat on assignments with a lot more ease, and that parents would be losing money if they had to stay home and supervise the student while the classes were being taken. For the moment, normal public school is the best option for students of this generation of students. If we were to revisit the topic in another couple of years, when the technology is better and there was a way for students to learn better social interaction, it may be viable way to teach. Let us try to make public schools better, safer, learning environments for the students of our generation, instead of trying to make a whole new system work.
