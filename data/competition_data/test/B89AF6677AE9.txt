Can students chosse what actived they would like to do. Will it help students at the school, and will they get help them get out more or be inside doing band, arts, or studing for school. It would have to be after school so they can hae the time, and plus there can be late buses so they don't have to worry about getting a ride or there partens picking them up. They could make new friends or be with there friends, by group activiyes.

A plus is that students will get off there phones and find somthing they would like to do. Another reason is the partents wont have to forces or make them do something they don't want to do in order to get them out.

I think it is a good idea becuse if you find something you like to do it will help you in phsycli activiy. I say I agree with all students doing one actinity they like.
