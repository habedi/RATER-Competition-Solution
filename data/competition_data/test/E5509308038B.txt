As a memeber of the Seagoing Cowboys it would be best if you joined the program because we could use all the help possible. You can even travel around the world helping as many people as you can. You can also help people recover food supplies and their animals. In the artical it says in paragraph 2 " UNRRA hired " Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas." Also in paragrph 5 it says " Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China". Then after every person, city, or state has been helped you finally got to go home with your family and friends. And to top it off with on your way home it says in paragraph 8 " The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, writing, and games also helped pass the time." Then in paragraph 9 it says " But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Lake Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. " It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."

My conclusion is to join the Seagoing Cowboys becausethey get to help peopleall around the world and they even get to travel all around the world.
