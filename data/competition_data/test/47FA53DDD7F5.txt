Cell phones are a good way to contact parents after school but that's not always the case. Cell phone users usually have there phones on during school and they get easily distracted. Students usually take out the phone in class and start texting. I don't think students should even have cell phones at all especially in school grounds. Students take out there phone in class and start texting while their teacher is giving the lesson. This makes students miss what they had to learn for the day. Along come test days and they didn't study, didn't rest, didn't pay attention and all for what? To text there friends.

What usually occurs is that they just text some other friend to ask them the answers to the test. These type of students are failing classes just to text their friends or even their boyfriends. They have not yet realized the importance of education. I used to have a phone myself and i got caught texting in class, and i noticed that my grades started to go down. One day i also got caught having inappropriate pictures on my phone and so i got fined for that. When i had a phone those were the worst days of my life.

Now i don't have a phone and my grades are great, I'm doing fine on tests and i don't get into trouble as much as i used to. School is very important, and we are very lucky that we get an education for free, and therefore we need to take advantage of that. So that way we can create a great future.
