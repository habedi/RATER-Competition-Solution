Phones & Driving

I feel like drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel this way because it's very dangerous. Texting and driving has been the main cause for most car accidents. Car accidents that can potentially lead to death or a serious injury. Not only are people putting their life at risk, but they're putting others life at risk as well. Texting can wait and should never be done while driving.

Operating a cellular device while driving a vehicle is dangerous in many ways. When your vehicle is traveling at 35 mph that means you are moving at 16 meters per second. So, in those few moments your eyes were on your cellular device instead of the road. This means you have moved far enough to not see a school bus, a kid playing, or a vehicle braking in front of you. Just reaching for your phone could be deadly as well.

Texting and driving has caused 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 injuries also occur each year due to texting and driving. Also 1 out every 4 car crashes occur due to texting and driving. Responding to a text while driving can distract a driver for around 5 seconds. At 50 mph this is enough time to travel the distance of a football field.

Honestly, I've seen so many people texting while driving while I was a passenger.

I didn't feel safe at all. It's almost like feeling like I'm in the car with a drunk driver. Seeing people drive reckless makes me wonder what's going to happen. I think that driving while texting should be banned completely.

So basically, cellular devices and cars are like oil and water. They don't mix well at all. If you take cellular device use while in cars out of the picture, this will benefit the world in many ways. There will be less car crashes, injuries, and deaths caused by distractions. Its simple cellular devices should not be used while operating a vehicle for any reason unless there is a life or death emergency. Taking them away from those operating cars or even bikes could save lives.
