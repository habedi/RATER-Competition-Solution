NASA has done a lot of research on the planet we call Mars. Twenty-five years ago NASA's Viking one spacecraft was taking photos of landing sites for Viking two. They found a human face. Some say that this face was created by aliens. I think it is just a natural landform.

First of all, mesas are common in Cydonia. As the text says, "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia." The shadows made it look like the landform had eyes, a nose, and a mouth. These are just shadows. Only afew Scientists thought that the Face was an Alien artifact.

Secondly, they took pictures and said that the face was just a landform. After they first saw the face, they wanted to take pictures as soon as possible. NASA flew the Mars Global Surveyor over Cydonia. As the article says, " Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos." That means those pictures were more accurate. These photos resulted that the Face was just a natural landform.

Lastly, scientists said that it was the same as landforms around the American west. Mission controller, Garvin, said, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." This is showing that the landforms here, are on Mars. Aliens didn't make our landforms though. The Face is actually a mesa or a butte and not an Alien artifact.

Some might say, that the second time, in 1998, the camera had to look through the clouds in order to see the face. This is true but, Mission control prepared to look again and went back in 2001. This time the camera had absolute maximum resolution. The text states that, "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking Photo." This camera saw very clearly and saw that it was a mesa or a butte.

In conclusion, scientists say the Face is just a landform. I agree with them and think that its just a landform. There are even pictures to prove that it was not an Alien artifact.
