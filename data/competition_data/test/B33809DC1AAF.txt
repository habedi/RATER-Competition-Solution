Why is making summer projects student-designed a good option? If teachers created the summer projects, students will not apply it to real life situations if possible, and will also may find no interest in the type of project they are being forced into completing. If summer assignments are student-designed, more students would take an interest and be willing to complete it.

If the summer assignments are student-designed, then they may be more creative based. Students who are able to use creativity may enjoy completing the summer assignment, because they have the ability to use their interests to complete the assignment. For example, if a student needs to complete an assignment on aerodynamics for a science class, and they are interested in how planes work, they could go to an airport, or watch a movie on them. This would work as a student based project because, the student has an interest in airplanes so he would be able to apply his interests to the project assigned. He could find the formula that applies to making planes fly. Another example may be if a student needs to complete a science project on how photosynthesis works. This would work as a student based project because, if the student has an interest in art, they could use their drawing capabilities to their advantage and draw the process of photosynthesis out. Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can use creativity.

If the summer assignments are student-designed, students will be able to brainstorm how they think is best fit to present and/or complete a project. An example of this is if a student is assigned a project from math to find the dimensions of anything, and explain why it is able to stand with those dimensions, they could choose whatever they see fit. This would work as a student based project because, the student has the ability to choose the item of his choice to find the dimensions of after brainstorming what his choice was. Another example of this may be for an art class, where the student is given multiple options to choose from as to what they wish to draw for the assignment. This would work as a student-designed project because, the student has the ability to choose what they want to select, and the assignment is not being forced upon them. Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can have the ability to choose from multiple options as to how they want to complete their project.

Some people may disagree with this opinion. They may say that students need to be told how to do their assignment because otherwise it won't get done. But, if students are given the chance, those people can be proven wrong. Schools should have student-designed summer assignments because, they are independent. An example of this is when a student sees that chores need to be done at home and does them. This is an example because, the student is doing the chores without being told to by a parent or guardian. Another example of this is if a student takes to notice that it is almost time for dinner at their home, and their parents or guardians are running late from work, they begin to prepare dinner so that it is ready when their parents or guardians return home.

When students have the ability to improve on their, creativity, independence and brainstorming skills, it can help them prepare for what the real world will throw at them.

It will not only help them explore their strengths and weaknesses, but also help prepare them for when they graduate from college and get a job. Schools should make the summer assignments student-designed because, it will help improve their creativity, independence, and independent thinking skills (brainstorming skills). In conclusion, students should have the chance to complete student-designed summer assignments rather than teacher-designed.
