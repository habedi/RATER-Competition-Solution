Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think all students should participate in community service.

We have students here at SCHOOL_NAME, who need, and I'm sure would like, some tutoring. We have plenty of well educated students here, that I'm sure would have no problem with helping the ones who need it.

A suggestion I have is to maybe put some fliers around the school, for kids who might be interested with different places around the area who might need some help around their work space.

Volunteering looks great on a college application too! I don't think some students realize that colleges look for this kind of stuff. Maybe some fliers about that, might do some good to.

Picking up garbage is a great way to volunteer, and to support our Eco

System. The Green Club should definitely know more about that. Local animal clinics, I'm sure the need help taking the dogs out to go to the restroom, cleaning cages, or restocking the animals food and water supply. the local hospital, or maybe even a nursing home. All of these are great ways to get involved in our community.

Please take these offers in to consideration.

Sincerely, 8th grader, STUDENT_NAME.
