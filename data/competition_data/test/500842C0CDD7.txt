Have you ever wanted to help people in need?

Are you a charity sort of person? Do you like seeing a battery of people happy? If you said yes to any of these, you're in luck. We have a job for you. My name's Luke and I was in the Seagoing Cowboys.

I know what your thinking, "What is a Seagoing Cowboy?" well I'll tell you. You get to travel around the world, look at all new types of animals, and try new foods. I've gone on these kinds of trips before, and trust me it's fun. You help people get back to their normal lives before the war. You'll look after their animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules.

Your life in America might be perfect, but every three seconds a child or adult dies in another country. So help out, pull your weight. We need to step up to the challenge and make a difference. The world isn't as perfect as you thought it was. You don't just help people. You change their point of view.
