Have you ever thought of being the only person in the car, and not having to drive? The idea of self-driving cars have been around since the late 1950's. Yeah, sure, it'd be cool to have a computer automated car, but this would take away the fun of driving.

Then again, it would cost less gas to have a coumputer dive your car for you, but if you wanted not to drive you could just call a taxi or catch a bus. The positive effects of self-driving cars are endless. The negative effects are also there to opose the positives.

Let's say my grandma is physiclly disabled and can't drive, a self-driving car could take her places without her having to call a family member or friend to come assist her. This is one positive effect. Now let's look at another senaro. Let's say it's a very hot day, and everything that's in the direct sun light is over 100 degrees. the sun would eventually fry or over heat the circuts inthe computer programing. The people cooler climates would have same but oposite effects. The wires and electical currents would freeze due to the cold climate.

So would you wanna have a self-driving car, or to drive the car yourself. the positives and negatives show. This is my postions on the "drverless/self-driving car". I will stick to traditional driving, with my foot on the pedal and my hands on the wheel.
