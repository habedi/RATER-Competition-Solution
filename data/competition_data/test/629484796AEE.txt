I think you guys should be in the Seagoing Cowboys. One reason of the reason why you should join is that if you like to travel than you should join another reason why you should join is that if like helping people you should join and the last reason why you should join is if you like animals and you want to take care of them than you should join the Seagoing Cow. If you want to join there is some bad news. One of the reasons why is that it takes two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean to get to the eastern coast of the United States and it took a month to get to China and another reason why its hard to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that if your 18 you have to join the military service. This is good news about being a Seagoing Cowboy one of the reason why it is good is that you can see diffrent things i saw an excavated castle in Crete and on my way to China i saw a Panama Canal. I hope you take all of this information and think about being joining the Seagoing Cowboys.
