I agree with having driveless cars. I think that having driveless cars could be good, but with some changes made to it. Yes, it uses less fuel than what most people already use today to go places, but if Google is saying that it's going to be driveless car, then it has to be a driveless car. You can't drive it, it has to drive itself, know when to stop at stop signs or red lights, know when to go at a green light.

As I read the passage, I noticed all these different things that the car cannot do that we want it to do. If this is suppose to be a driverless car, then why do we still have to have our hands on the wheel? Can't we just get in and have it atuomatically turn on as soon as it feels weight being put upon it? Then all we would have to do is buckle in, take out or phones and scroll through picutres and what not.

If Google really wants to make this a driverless car, then make it one. Don't make it to where we would still need our hands on the wheel, helping the car. It should know how to do everything already. We shouldn't have to back out on our own. The car itself should be alert when there's an accident, not us. The car should be alert when there's work zones, again, not us. The car should be alert at all times.

Everyone in this generation is already trying to text while driving at the same time and try not crash, but it still happens. Alot of people now are driving drunk which is bad. With driverless cars though, that won't happen. Everyone would be safe and we wouldn't have any accidents anymore.

When we get into the car, the car should back out on its own. It should know when to make hard stops if some other car gets in the way, it should know when right away where it needs to go when we tell it.

I honestly still think that having driverless cars will be better than what we drive now. More people will get into less accidents, no more reckless driving, no more texting while trying to drive. Everyonr will be safer with driverless cars. The world could be a better place with them and no one would ever have to worry anymore. Parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids going out and not crashing. This could solve a lot of other things. Drunk driving being one of them. With driverless cars, the driver has no control over the car. So, if someone decides to go out and get drunk and then head home by themselves, the car will get them home safely without any trouble. No one will get hurt.

We'll be a more safe enviroment with these cars. Less fuel, less accident, less reckless driving, less impatient drivers as well. There will be more less drunk driving and those drunk drivers hurting or even killing others while driiving. Everyone has different opinions about this topic, and this is mine.
