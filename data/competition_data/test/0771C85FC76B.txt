The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. There are many ways that this can and cannot work. It would be great to have the students potentially have the best classroom experience possible, but that is not always the case. The system is a great idea, but it may not work for everyone. After all, it is technology, so it is not guaranteed to work one hundred percent of the time.

Many things can go wrong with the FACS. Not everyone has the same shape of face or the same shape of muscle in their face, so can it really tell the exact emotions of everybody? Computers are great things in our world, but they do not always work the way you would want them to. This software would most likely have bugs and glitches for a while before they even come close to perfecting it. Many things can go wrong.

The article states that humans perform these "calculations" everyday. Why do we need a computer to calculate our emotions when students can go to a classroom and have an actual human teacher? The article provides much great and helpful information and pros to this software. Logically thinking, people can come to the conclusion that they do not need a computer software such as the FACS to cope with their emotions. The FACS may be valuable to very few people.

The FACS is just showing how people are not developing the social skills they should have. In the article, Dr. Huand states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". Students should just go to class and have a real human teacher so they can ask them for help if they are confused or bored. Computers should not have human qualities that sounds ridiculous. Dr. Huang also never mentioned what the FACS would cost either, it could be hurting peoples' pocketbooks.

The use of the FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. As stated earlier in the essay this is what real humans are for. This is also coming from a high school student who does not take online classes. This software would not be much help to the students who go into school everyday and see real life teachers and not computers. Dr. Huang could have mentioned much more in this article, he focuses on all of the pros of the software but none of the cons. The article is quite biased and its purpose is to hype students up for a cool new software.
