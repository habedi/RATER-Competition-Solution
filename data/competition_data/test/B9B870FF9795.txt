It is the second week of seventh grade and you have seen tons of signs hanging up for extracurricular activities. You are interested, but would it be what it says it is? Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they get a sense of teamwork, they get an opportunity to make new friends, and it allows them to step out of their comfort zone.

When you participate in school activities, it gives you a sense of what teamwork is like. Throughout your whole life, you will need to do some type of teamwork. If you don't know what teamwork feels like, then some points in your life are going to be challenging for you. These activities will allow you to experience teamwork, and working together. Everyone in the activity will need to eventually come together and work hard as a group no matter what type of activity it is.

Participating in these activities also allows you to make new friends. Sometimes when you join something like this, you might not have any friends in the group, but by the end you will have all come together. I tried out for a softball team, and none of friends were on it. Everyone else knew each other or had friends, except for me. Now that we have gotten to know each other, we have all gotten close and I couldn't do softball without them. Sometimes the friends you unexpectedly make, turn into you life long friends. Just think, it is all because of the activity that you joined in seventh grade.

Lastly, these activities, will most of the time, make you come out of your comfort zone. In the moment, it kind of sucks, but in the long run, it will teach you amazing life skills. I am one of the shyest people I know, but doing all the activities and being on all these teams, have really helped me be just the slightest bit braver in facing these things. Trust me it can be very nerve wrecking but, it does so much good for you in the outcome.

Participating in school activities will allow you to experience teamwork, have an opportunity to make new friends, and step out of your comfort zone. Trust me it will do you so much good in the long run of things. So, get out there and try one of the activities because you will never know where you end up with it, and it was all because you did those three things in that seventh grade club.Â
