I'm a scientist at NASA and me and a group of scientist have been discussing the face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. While Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible lading sites of his sister ship Viking 2. He had spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Viking 1 snapped a photo of it and sent it to the Jet Propulsion lab.

A few days later the NASA unveiled the image for all to see. Scientist discoverd that the face was formed by a shadow giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." Over the past years scientist believe it would attract more attention to Mars. It certainly did! The famous face on mars became a pop icon all over the world. It stared in many things like hollywood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows as well.

After the big news that the face was a success scientist soon found out that other scientist believe it was an alien artiract. Jim Garvin explained that they felt this was important to taxpayers. He also photographed the face as soon as he could get a good shot at it.

On april 5, 1998 a group of

Mars Global Surveyor flew to mars and took ten more photos, That were sharper then what the Viking 1 took. Thousands of people have been waiting for the images to be posted on the website JPL. Soon after the photos were taken Mars global Surveyor have posted the images there wern't actually alien monument after all.

Many people wern't satisfied with the information that has came back to them including Garvin. Garvin stills believe that the faces that were found were yet to be alien artifacts. Garvin wants them to retake the pictures and do the research again. The Mars Global Surveyor does it agian and they retake the pictures more clearly. Scientist has come to an conclusion the the faces that were found on Mars is not yet found.
