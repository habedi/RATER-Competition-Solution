Over the years, schools have adopted the way of offering distance learning to enhance thw growth or high level of education. Most colleges in the country offer distance learning for students to be able yo attend class from home by way of online or video confrencing to archieve their grades or credits to graduate and be suuccesful. I believe students will benefit alot with distance learning. Most schools like Virginia Common Wealth University(VCU), Old Dominion University(ODU), George Mason University(GMU) are first class school who provide long distance education to the country and the state. There are many reasons i would encourage parents and students to involve themselves into being interested in distance learning.

Distance learning does not only teach student's just the study of Science, Mathematics, or English. It also helps students benefit in moral teaching, moral skills, and a way of living on your own to archieve your goals. It also helps students solve their own problems own their own without the help of their parents. With distance learning you can apply to have your job to be able to carter for yourself. Distance learning makes you prepared for type of job career you have interest in. Most jobs careers require alot of hardwork and alot of time to study for you to archieve the credits and grades you need to graduate. Studying Medicine, Engineering,and Architecturing requires alot of time, students attend school over the normal four years program to archieve everything in life. This requires alot of determination to be able to archieve your goals and to be succesful. Virginia has some of the best schools in the country thaat offers a long distance learning.

Many reports have been made around the world about long distance learning education that has affected the idea of allowing parents enroll their wards into a long distance learning institutions, such as schoool shooting, food poisoning. We know parents care about the safety of their wards well being but long distance institutions are protected by the state police department that prevent any kind of harm that will be caused by any students on campus. Schools that offer long distance education protects the rights and life of the students, students are being inspected frequently by the police department regularly to check the safety of the student to make sure everything is okay. Students are protected and are able to attend class all the time, even due to serious weather conditons students are prevented and protected by the school to stay indoors during a bad weather. Parents should be educated on the safety the school gives their wards and how long distance education benefits every student.

Sooner or later, long distance education will be more benefited and more safer for parents to allow their wards to enroll in long distance learning to archieve their goals. Most Jobs recquire students to have alot of time to study and practice to be able to pass and graduate. I encourage every student to enroll in long distance learning to explore new things, have a good environment of study, and to adopt a certain way of life he or she has gained in long distance education.
