I believe that we should study and explore Venus further. I agree with the author about this because I'm interested in ourter space and planets. I'm not just saying this because of my interest, but also because if it's so similar to Eath than let's study it more. They referr Venus as Earth's twin so let's see what makes it it's twin. The passage adds than the atmosphere is different in Venus and we would need to be preapred for that.

Going and exploring Venus is a risk but sometimes we just have to go in and take that risk. Life is all about taking risks and going for it. We never know what new studies we could find in Venus. Personally I would like to know how Venus has similar feature like Earth but has a totally different atmosphere. It also has earthquackes, volcanoes, and lighting strikes just liek Earth.

I like the idea NASA had that we should send humans to study Venus. For this to happen we would need to have them float above the surface. We wouldn't know if it's safe for them to land on Venus's surface jus yet. The conditions would be the extreme temperature and more. But these conditions are survivable for humans.

After reading this passage, we could go study Venus a bit more. They talked about the conditions it would have and, what would we need to do so it can happen. It's possible for this to happen so we might as well go. It's a challenge but not an impossible one. It would be cool to see if sciencist find more discoveries about Venus
