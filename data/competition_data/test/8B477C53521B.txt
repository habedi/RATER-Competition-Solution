Students should attend classes at

Home because students will put a lot of Afros on there works , students will not get distracted by someone else , and some students like to work by them self's.

Some people think that students should't not be allowed to have classes online because they will not pot attention on there works and they will get distracted with there little siblings , TV , phone etc. That's not a good reason because some students like to work alone and they dont get distracted by someone else.

I think students should have classes on online because students will learn more, they will pot a lot Afros on there works .Most of the time ,student like to work by them self s .For example , when they work in a group of students ,most of the time only one person works on there or sometimes we dont do anything we just play a around. Therefore, students should have classes at home.

Additionally , i think students should have classes online because some students will enjoy to have classes online they are not going to have to much Esters on there works classes. Students might not have money to eat at school or they dont have friends .For example some students dont like when someone else is coping and then they get mad and the want to fight that person. Therefore , students should take classes at home for they can prevent those Cains of things.

Some people think that students dont need to take classes online ,but i strongly believe we should have classes online.
