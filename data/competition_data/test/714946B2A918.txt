To begin with, I strongly believe that phone shouldn't be used while driving. The reason I say this, is because using a phone while driving can be a big impact on us today. For an example, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident, Georgia is a hand free state and lastly it's a distraction.

First off, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident. The usage of phones is way too high to be used while driving. Did you know teenagers are having accidents because of these phones? The death rate went up because of using a phone while driving seems to be more important than our lives.

Another reason why phones shouldn't be use is because Georgia is a hand free state. You can end up with a glove department fool of tickets because of this phone problem. Now you have to come out the pocket to pay this ticket when you could have obeyed the law. This play a large roll because you can't stay of your phone to save lives. This play a large roll because the law is trying to save lives.

Last but not least, the phone is a huge distraction to the people who is driving. I say this because I seen it with my own eyes that a phone can distract a person. In the blink of the eye you might end up swerving around a car or probably worse. Also this can be prevented if the diver ignores everything on the outside. I mention this because if the diver does this the death rate might decrease.

In conclusion, driving with a phone can have a large impact on us today. Also driving with a phone is a dangerous game to be play at any age.
