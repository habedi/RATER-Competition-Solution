Dear Principal,

I think you should let students used their cell phones during free periods. It would give them a chance to relax and talk to their friends while they can without being next to them. Also, it will give them more responsibility to turn off their phones when their free time is over. The students would be happier and be able to express themselves more if they were able to choose to use their phones.

Everyone likes to talk to their friends when they can. Letting students use their phones in school would let them do that. They would not have to be right next to the other person and they would be able to ask about school things if they needed to like homework and class work. Also, students would be able to get all of their talking out of the way so they are focused for when they go back to class. Other kids who are trying to be rude to people texting and talking to their friends on their phone would not be able to get into the conversation and get the other person upset.

It would be a big responsibility to have phones in school. Students would be able to use them during any free period they want as long as they got turned off when they got back to class. This would help teach responsibility more because there would be less phones getting taken away. Teachers would also get to see if their students would follow the rules and turn their phones off. Also, if students had to turn their phones off and they did, there would be less phones getting sunk into the classroom and used.

You can tell a lot about a person by the amount of time they use their phones. Some use them every chance they get, and some barely use their phones. Students at school would be able to express themselves more by being able to use their phones and the teachers would be able to know who they are better.

Girls and boys would be happier and even make more friends at school better then they were able to before. They'd be able to relate to other people more. There would possibly be less bullying because they wouldn't be able to see other peoples' conversations and make fun of them for what they say to their friends.

Students at schools always use their phones. If they were able to use them during free periods, they would be more relaxed and able to talk to their friends more often, it would teach them responsibility to turn their phones off when they go back to class, and they would be happier and able to express themselves more in school.
