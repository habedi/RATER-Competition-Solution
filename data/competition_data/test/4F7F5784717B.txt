I think policy two would be a better choice for students because if you allow the usage of cell phones then some kids might take advantage of it. If students were allowed to have cell phones during school they would be distracted and would not focus on their schoolwork.

Even though the plan is to allow cell phones during school but not during classes, students will be unruly and take advantage of the opportunity by using their cell phones during class while the teacher is not looking.

If you do not allow cell phones in school and you enforce it then there might not be any problems with the usage of cell phones and students would be able to focus on their school work. That is why I think policy number two would be a better choice for schools.

If the students get the experience of having cell phones in the classrooms then they might not take advantage of it. But you can not be sure of that. Some students can act spoiled and use ell phones for wrong purposes.

Some students could communicate with each other doing bad things. For example some would use it o make a bomb threat, or send something inappropriate to another student. Some kids might also use their cell phones for not only bomb threats but also regular threats that might cause harm to another student. And you nor the deputy of the school would know about it. Unless they start to act suspicious.

It is just like the book if you give a mouse a cookie, they will either take advantage of it or they will use i for wrong purposes, or they might even want more or something else. Cell phones can lead to more fights and possibly more failures.
