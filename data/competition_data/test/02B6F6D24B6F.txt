Should summer projects be student-designed? In my opinion, yes; I feel as though summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to express their creativity and have the freedom to think outside the box, rather than be held back of their ideas and inner thoughts. On the other hand, teachers also feel as though that they should be allowed to give specific project topics or ideas to their students, instead of students creatively thinking for themselves due to a lack of performance in the classroom. Though, teachers believe summer projects should be designed through their ideas due to poor performance in the classroom, students should be given a chance to express themselves and the freedom to create their own projects.

As a student, summer break is supposed to be a time to get away from school, classwork, homework, and a time to relax. However, in other schools; learning never stops. Due to schools wanting kids to learn during summer vacation, students are given summer projects to keep them focused. All students around different schools believe that having the chance to create things using their ideas will enhance their learning experience. Also, students feel as though that teachers are more in tune of what the students feel or want, rather than give them an assignment that doesn't appeal to them as much. Furthermore, I; myself as a student has had the chance to receive student-designed projects and to me, it's one of the greatest things not only for me, but for my classmates as well; it allows us to show our ability in what we know how to do and how well do we understand the topic we choose in exchange for a good grade.

In other cases, there are teachers who believe that classroom performance can play a roll in students receiving teacher-designed projects during the summer. Some teachers disagree in allowing a class to behave poorly or set low expectations for each other and give them an assignment that will be "fun" or "enjoyable" to please students. Other teachers for instance, think that students need to challenge themselves more in class and not settle for a decent grade, instead; elevate their work ethic to a greater amount for the grade they worked for. However, teachers will also give assignments just based on lesson plans or things they truly believe is what needs to be focused on and assigned to the students.

In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to have projects designed by them to see what they know, showcase their ability of creating a unique topic that's original, and allow teachers to see what students can do on their own, than seek guidance to have a planned project assigned to them.
