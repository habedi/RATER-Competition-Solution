The landform is clearly not from ancient origin in the enhanced picture of the mesa. It is way too cold for life to exist on Mars or civilization to thrive. Mars has no food, no water, and the climate is harsh most of the time.

There is no oxygen on Mars and there is no way to survive without special equipment. If aliens did exist why would they settle for Mars and not Earth. It is most likely just a natural landform that coincidentally looks like a face. Images show that with enhanced graphics the landform looks nothing like a face.

There are different landforms on Earth that look like faces too. Even if there were ancient structures in Mars they probably were destroyed by the intense storms that happen every day on Mars. Its unlikely that there were aliens that the mesa is from ancient origin considering we don't have proof of aliens yet.
