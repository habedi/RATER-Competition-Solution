Dear: Principal,

I personally don't mind community service, but I'd rather not have to do it. It's good helping out the community in which we live in, but I'd have to say it does take to much time away.

I mean it's just to much to do, not saying that I'm lazy, but that's just me. Sometimes, we may need to help out the community, but that's just occasionally. Sometimes, I don't think it's necessary because, other people isn't helping so why do we have to help? But, then again it is our community. I mean I would prefer not to. Maybe at time to time I'll even volunteer to do community work. I just don't think you should require all the students to do community work. I just don't think that's a good idea. I think it's best if you just send out a message to see who volunteers. I'm definitely sure that students will volunteer, so you won't have to make to the point where every student has to do community work. That's just on my side of the story, I'm just trying to give you my opinion, so that not all students are required. Personally I just don't think that's a fair decision.

Your Student.
