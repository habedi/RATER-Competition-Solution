I see that you believe that the Face could mean that there are or were a sort of life form on Mars. This is easy to belive at first glance, but we decided to look further. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over this red planet. The MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed a natural landform. This concluded that there was no alien monument on Mars.

But many theorists, like yourself, stayed unconvinced. Again on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. This time the photo was taken by Malin's team, and they used the camera's maximum resloution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. The image taken actually portrays a Martian version of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." says Jim Gravin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.

Thus, I state my response again: there was no astraterestrial life on Mars.
