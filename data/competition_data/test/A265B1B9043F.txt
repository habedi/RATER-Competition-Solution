Have you ever been so busy and don't have time for nothing? Stuff just feels like it keeps on piling on you. I know how that feels. That is why students should not have to do extracurricular activity because students all ready have plans, students like to go home after school, and students have to keep grades good.

To begin, extracurricular activity take away from other plans students have to do such as hanging out with your friends and family. For example, most students do sports but they get annoyed because they never have time to go to the movies or the mall with their friends cause they all ways have to practice. Also, sometimes students get out of practice late so students won't have time to go anywhere. Unfortunately, if they had plans they would be ruined. Another thing, is students won't have time for their families and that's sad because family is very important. That is why students do not like doing extra stuff after school.

In addition, some students are not active like others. Therefore,students like to go home and just chill and stay on their phones. Also, some students are anti-social which makes it hard for them to talk to people when you are doing activities you have to be able to talk to people. However, In some students eyes staying at home watching YouTube is way more interesting then going outside or doing indoor activities.

Also, when students are doing activities they grades have to stay up sometimes that can be difficult for students because they're more focus on the activity they're doing then their work. For example, if students are in basketball if they didn't get their work done in school they have to stay on the bench and do their work. Therefore, it can get stressful cause you want to get up and play but you can not because you are falling behind in school.

In conclusion, students shouldn't do activities cause they have to much on their plates. Also, it causes a lot of stress on the students. But I may be wrong what do you think students should do when it comes to extracurricular activities.
