Dear principal,

I believe people disserve to pick why any and why not they want to do community services. I say that if you love the earth then go a head and pick up litter. If you like to watch children then do it and have fun. If you to darn lazy to help the earth or people that are younger then you then be that way its your choice . But principle its not fair that you are trying to make every one do it community service is basically for cops when you are bad and you don't want to go to jail you have to do community service. Were not bad people we didn't do any thing rung so you cant tell us we do or we don't gatta do community service. It is a privilege for some people and it is torture for others and i know you are the boss of the school and every thing but we are students and we disserve to pick if we do or don't it is a school choices not a have to thing and if you want you could make it an after school activity for people who want to do it. I have friends who love to do it and i have friends who hate it. Its there choice i don't really care there still my friends and there your students so please think about it thank you.
