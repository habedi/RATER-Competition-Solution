Dear Principle,

Letting students bring cell phones to school is a choose of freedom towards the children

Policy one sounds like a pretty good idea. Student using their phones during any free time, though having them turned off during class. It is clear to the student of these rules, though if the problem is that someone is using their phones during class, a more suitable punishment would be to take their phone away like most teachers do.

Having cell phones completely forbidden from school may not be the smartest choice of all. Some students must call their parents when they get to school from walking or riding the bus so that the parent may know if their okay. Also, some students, such as myself, need to call their parents when they get out of school, to know that their child is alright and is ready to get picked up, or to even know if their parents are going to pick them up or that they must go walking.

Phones can be a hazard if they are not under the correct use or are not being followed by the rules. Yet, with the maturity level of the students, I'm pretty sure as young adults they will do what they are told.

Phones should be accepted in school, the only reason some people may think they shouldn't be allowed, is probably for disturbance of the class. But, do you believe a student can respect the rules? Of course they can!!!

We must not abandon cell phones from the student body, but only punish those who break the rules.
