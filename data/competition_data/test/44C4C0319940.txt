Cell phones have become a important item in today's society.

There have been people who use this item excessively, especially while they drive.

Driving while using cell phones can make the driver less focused, not only on the road but to your surroundings.

Not paying full attention can also slow down your reaction time.

When it comes to cell phones and driving I support the use of them with moderation (use when parked).

Cell phones can benefit the driver in many ways.

They can be used as a gps.

It helps people who are driving alone and can't get someone else to use a paper map.

A phone can be a source of entertainment too.

For those who enjoy songs or podcast that are not normally on the radio.

Most drivers can be distracted by cell phones.

One example is if their phone falls out of the vehicle mount. This action will tempt them to pick it up causing their attention to be taken off of the road which can lead to a car crash.

Another would be holding a conversation with someone one the phone.

Finally sending or reading a text message.

Even though cell phones can provide a driver with options on their experience while riding.

Being able to listen to different types and styles of music.

Also making sure you are going to the proper destination.

It should not be used to the point where it can take you attention off the rode.
