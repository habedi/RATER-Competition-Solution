Cars may actually disappear from the modern world humans live in. Cars sales are decreasing, and fewer cars actually are a benefit by making the air cleaner and making traffic and travel time faster.

Pollution is one issue that people have been trying to limit for years now. One way people can reduce emissions is to stop using their car. According to

Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer , pollution in Paris drastically decreased after driving bans were implemented. The ban on driving cleared up enough smog, that the French government was able to rescind the ban. Across the globe, transportation is America's second largest source of emissions and pollution as explained in

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal . Rosenthal explains how that the decreasing number of cars on the roads in America will help the environment and decrease carbon emissions. Car emissions may be the largest form of pollution in America, but the percentage in American cities where most people are found has a drastically higher amount of emissions. Both Duffer and Rosenthal show that automobile decreases lead to pollution deacreases as well. Cars limitaions will lead to greener grasses and bluer skies.

Traffic is a problem that most people experience during their daily travels, whether its going to school or work. Limiting cars will lower traffic in cities everywhere. Shown in

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal , the city of Vauban, Germany has stores placed a walk away instead of far away in malls. Vauban has its stores located closer, which will be easier to access to citizens, instead of waiting on a highway with a traffic jam. Also in Bogota, Columbia, car and rush hour restrictions have drastically lowered traffic time, as well as opened bike lanes for a new means of transportation, according to

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky . New bike lanes and sidewalks open up a new way to travel, distributing people between two ways of transportation instead of cramming everyone onto one highway. 118 miles of bike lanes have been built in Bogota and hopefully in new places too, to lower traffic and transportation time. Car limitaions will lead to a quicker way to get to the place you want to be at, instead of waiting in a line full of automobiles.

Cars are disappearing anyways, due to culture and people being happier.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal shows how people in the city feel about the restrictions on cars. Heidrun Walter said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Walter is joyful now that car limitations were implemented. Rosenthal explains the stress-free life in Vauban, with its children playing and riding bikes in the outdoors. This happy life may actually be shaping citizens of America due to its decrease in car purchases, and license decreases.

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal explains that the peak of driving was at 2005, and now people are going through a long-term cultural shift. Driving decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 in younger people. People are not buying cars, because they do not need them. Car limitations may not even be needed due to happier people and the downfall of driving.

Cars are dissapearing due to limitations, and that is a great thing. Less cars means less pollution and traffic, along with happier people and a car-free culture. A better environment and a faster way to travel, will result in joyous people.
