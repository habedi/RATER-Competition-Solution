The author is right study Venus, in the text it says that it is earch twin and that Venus has mountains and other things like earth so they could have had life there a long time ago. Even though it will be a struggle to study Venus it would be worth it beacuse it could be a second earth. It would be hard to get on the surface of Venus the average temperature is over 800 degrees.

The study of Venus would be hard but NASA has one compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They would have to hover/float above the fray at about 30 or more miles above the landscape and the air pressure would be close to Earth sea levels it wont be an easy conditons for humans but surviable. However they would have to get close to Venus surface so that they could get rock samples. That's why the author says they would need to make a machine to last a long enough time to cotribute meaningfully on Venus. Venus is our sister planet it is inhopitable,still today Venus still has some features like Earth. The planet has a rocky surface and has valleys,mountains, and craters. In the text the author says;"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit".

Venus can one day be a livning condtion for us people on Earth that's why the author wants us to study the planet in the last paragraph the author says;"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expaned to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
