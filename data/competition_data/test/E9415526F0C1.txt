I think that if technology could read students emotional expressions, it would make things easy to find out if someone is upset, mad, happy, and much more. So if someone was to be depressed and they do the best they could to hide it from many people even their family members or friends. So what im tying to say is that if technology could actually help detect those types emotions it could stop people from hurting them selfs. Because many people have comittide sucide due to depression or hate, so if the technology could read the students emotions or anyone one else's then it could prevent stuff like suicide or someone going after someone else. Technology could help people find ways to stop things like that from ever happening so I think the value of using technology like that could help many people out and save a life, a whole lot of lives.

Like in the article it talked about how they wanted know the emotions The Mona Lisa had, right? Well by havingn that type of technology, it could tell us all the emotions that The Mona Lise had. In the artical it even said that, by using all 44 major muscles in the model of a human like muscles a person has in real life it could help detect the emotions a person has and it would also tell about the emotions a painting could of had or does. It should be a very helpful pice of technology that could help change many things and help others give a smile to someone who is feeling sad or mad about something.
