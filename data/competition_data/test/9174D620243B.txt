Do you think that the students should take classes from home?

In this paper I will argue about, why the students should not take classes from home and reasons why is better go to school.

Many students when finish the high school, have the option to take online classes or go to collage,however the majority to prefer the idea to take class from home and is good, but have negative parts like:

Questions;Â if you have a specific question, that need be explain with details, you can't do it, like a mathematic problem, experiments or when use correctly a world. Personal I have many questions during my English class, like when use "commas, period, capilazation worlds, write a essay" and my teacher come to me and explain me how is the correct way to do that.

Time; some classes or topics required time to understand really well, but online classes are limited with the time, for example the subject World History for me, some topics are confused and need a slowly and at great lenght explication like "differences between Greece and Rome, Origin of Christianity" and my World History teacher explain me thoroughly, when, how and what happened is these eras.

Homework; someones think that the homework is unnecessary, but I think it's, my Algebra teacher sometimes, he leave me homework to practice the lesson and to memorize the formulas, that's helpful for me, because during the test I remember what I saw during the class.

The students think that online classes are great, because they don't need wake early, make homework, spend a long time in a specific class or go to a building, however their are wrong.

In my opinion take classes on the school permitted me have a personal and direct conversation with my teacher, share differents ideas with my partners, have more details about a topic and tell what I understand and what not.

In the future school have better technology and students want to take classes in a classroom for use the modern machines or electronic devices and esay way to learn.
