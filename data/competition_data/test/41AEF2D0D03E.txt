At school, students usually choose not to participate any extracurricular activity. Students should participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. It could be fun and students also can make more friends. That's why principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Students should participate in sports. Most students like sports. It is fun and it' s good for your health. It is good to choose to participate. Students can make more friends and community. Students should participate. They could trust themselves and not to afraid. Students should participate the extracurricular activity.

Students should participate at least one. They should participate on the yearbook. Yearbook is the best way to keep your memory about school and friends. Students should participate, they could serve on the students council. It maybe fun for them. Students should participate more. It is the best way to learn and to build community. It maybe fun to participate.

However, participate or not to participate is students choice. Principal should' t force students to participate, maybe they don' t want to. students could not understand how to participate. Maybe students don' t know how to participate, because they didn' t participate before. Principal should not decided that all students must participate at least one extracurricular activity.

Principal should' t force students to participate. Participate is the only way to help students make more friends, build community and get better grade. For me, participate is the best way to learn and to get better grade, but principal should' t force students to participate. I disagree, principal should' t decided that all students must participate, because it is students choice.
