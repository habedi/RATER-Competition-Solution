After World War II countries around the world were left in ruins. To help countries recover 44 nations banded together and created UNRRA. Also known as the United Nation Relif and Rehabilitation Administration. UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of animals shipped overseas to help those fallen nations. While some people think it is a bad idea to go over seas and be a "Seagoing Cowboy" it is a great opportunity to help other nations.

Not only do they help people the cowboys have fun aboard the ship. They don't concider it a boring job. On return ships after the animals were unloaded the cowboys played tabel tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to name just a few. The cowboys also have a side benifit of being able to sight see. They go to Venice, Italy and can take a gondola ride. See many gothic castles, or Churches in England. See the Panama Canal. You can go see China.

As stated before helping people is an other benift. You deliver people cows, mules, horses. While the animals were most likely eaten of killed during the war you can deliver a new calf and its mom to a places were all the animals were lost. Although you might be always busy, you get to feed animals, take care of animals, and see overjoyed faces of people when you bring in mules, cows, and horses.

Even with the World War II over there is still many threats. Starvation, overcrowding, more wars, and many other threats. Although in those nations these cowboys were able to stomp out Starvation for a bit. Serve your nation in the United Nation Relif and Rehabilition Administration. While helping the UNRRA and becoming a "Seagoing cowboy is very important for your nation and other nations it is also a great opportunity for anybody to help.
