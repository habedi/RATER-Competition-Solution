Dear Principal

I think that we should be able to bring cell phones to school.

I think that because we could text to our friends during lunch.

Also our parents might want to call us to check up on us.

Lastly, we could call an adult if there's an emergency.

One reason of why we should be able to bring cell phones to school is that we could text to our friends during lunch.

Sometimes when our friends can't find us, we could text them telling them where we are.

Also they could text us to remind us what assignments we have.

Another reason is that parents might want to call us to check up on us.

Our parents don't always trust us and will call us making shore that we're still in school.

Also they will call us to remind us to ask our teacher what assignment we missed.

Lastly, we could call an adult if there's an emergency.

If we get cut or have an allergic reaction, we could call someone to help.

Also if we are getting bullied, someone could call you so you could help.

Again I think that we should be able to bring cell phones to school because we could text to our friends during lunch, our parents might want to call us to check up on us, and we could call an adult if there's an emergency.
