Dear Principal,

I have heard the news that you are only permitting students with a grade B average to participate in sports activities. Despite the majority of the school having a grade C average, I fully agree with you. Allowing students to play sports without monitoring their grades is unacceptable. This new rule will instruct students to get what they want by working hard in school for it.

If a student is profound about a sport and just views school as a way to get into sports, they will obviously be practicing their sport rather than doing homework or studying. If students do good in school, then they should be rewarded by playing whatever sport they desire; not the other way around. Academics comes before extracurricular activities, in my view.

Some students might say that they should be privileged to play sports no matter what grades they get, but I believe they should have to work to be rewarded by playing their sport. This new rule you are permitting will allow students to realize and understand the concept of being rewarded for hard work.

Sincerely,

Your Student, STUDENT_NAME
