Dear Mr. Senator

Based on the facts and the articles i have just read, i've made a preposition that the U.S. should be provided a direct election. Adults, teens, and senoir citizens have their opinion on how they want their government to be. I beleieve that if people have a direct election you will get a more straight up answer. by changing the Electoral College people will actually feel like they have a say in what the gonernment does these day.

If the Electoral College doesn't change soon there is going toi be a lot of angry americans. Like there was a fued in election of 2008 election (with Obama) when floridas vote didnt really count, there was people in the house next to mine yelling and screming at the telivision, my dad and grandmother were having throwing a fit. It was one of the most horrible nights i have ever seen. if americans had the choice to direct vote I feel that people would be happier.

With the information I have gathered, americans should have a choice on how they choose the government, like to be honest having the votes go to a representative of state and they choose who becomes the president, doesn't seem like the smartest thing to do. They could be pressured, threatend and even killed because people are crazy theseÂ  days. if we had a direct election people could vote their own way and actually be happy and have extra money to live on.

finally I state my opinion even stronger than the first time, the U.S. should be provided the best possible things, even in pollitics.

Youirs truelly, young american.
