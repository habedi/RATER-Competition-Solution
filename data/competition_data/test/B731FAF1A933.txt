If you clean up trash on the side of the road then that is helping the community. If you are walking to a building and you see trash the pick it up because we want to save our community. If i was walking down the sidewalk and very important building then i would pick up the trash on the side of the road. If i see someone throw there trash out the i will pick it up because i don't want to lose our community. I don't like it when people put there trash on the floor because if it is your trash then you pick it up. In the lunch room the other day there was trash on the table so i picked it up because the teacher said if you don't pick your trash up then the whole class will have silent lunch then you wont get to talk to your friends. I don't like to liter and i don't like it when people liter. I like it when people do not liter and when i don't liter. I think that kids should go around and pick up trash around the school and see how easy it is to pick up the trash in our community. It would not hurt them to pick up trash once in there life time.
