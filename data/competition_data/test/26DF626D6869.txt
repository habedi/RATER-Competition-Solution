Proper Driver Cellphone Usage

The question of ¨ Should Cellphones be allowed to use while driving?¨, Is on the minds of many and it is believed that Cell phones should be used responsibly while driving to be able to stay safe and contact those you need to. Since Cellphones are storage for information to use and a fast way to contact anyone you want or need to at any time. However, Cellphones are also methods of distractions for those driving, leading to car crashes which causes injury and death.

Keeping both these in mind Cellphones should be used while driving but only to a certain degree.

Without a restriction on Cellphone usage, the results may be disastrous. A record in 2017 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States(¨

There is also the fact of high school students who reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive, and typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles(¨ Cell Phones ¨).

With all these dangers present when you use your phone and drive it's hard to see why people should be allowed in any way at all. Sadly the world is not and will never be that black and white. For those using their phones, there could be a plethora of reasons including Contacting bosses and appointments to state a late arrival, contacting family and friends for important news or updates, and more. Granted, reasons may also include just wanting to converse with others and update their social media but in this day and age, more teens will be doing just that. Luckily there is a way to do all of these and still maintain a safe driving ability and that is by using Bluetooth and vocal activation/response. These features in cars and phones allow you to text back and read messages through your phone or your car just by speaking back. There is also the ability to call via Bluetooth and speak verbally while still focusing on the road and still checking in with your boss, coworkers, family, and friends.

It's no longer a matter or should or should not but a matter of how. The dangers of cellphone usage while driving is apparent in everyday life and in the shocking statistics of the matter and yet it still happens. With the technology available and proper rationale it is possible to get the best of both worlds, you can contact others for any reason and also be able to drive safely on the road. Therefore, cell phones should be allowed while driving but only to a certain degree; which is the hands' free talk and text available to you via car Bluetooth or voice recognition on your cellular devices.
