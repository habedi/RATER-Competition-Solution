Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

Schoolwork should always comes first in life so that our society may thrive on the next generation of adults. Not only does that affect our future as a country, but the children's future as athletes. As a student at this school, I agree 100% with the policy change. Students need to learn not to procrastinate, to finish their work on time and perfect, and also to respect the help from adults.

Procrastination is the worst possible thing, next to the number of detentions, that this school has. Students on sports teams have stated that they "have no time to complete the assignment" or "the game went into overtime." The students of SCHOOL_NAME need to learn how to get things done in an efficient way in order to have time for sports. The only way that the students are to learn the concept of no procrastination is to have the parents to make sure it gets done. I do not think it matters what method the parents choose, I only want to see more and more kids showing up and playing sports.

Students are completing their homework though, but the finished product is very sloppy. Another one of the problems is that students rush through their homework and hope that the teacher will give them an A so they may play in the game after school. The only problem with this is that students just do not want to take the time to check their work and actually learn the concept. This in fact does affect the students' grades. Test grades go way down, and the homework scores go down as well all because of the time it took for the student to complete the assignment.

Teachers generally spend almost half the class time going over an assignment that the class will do for homework that night. The third problem is just that. Teachers spend almost the whole day helping students prepare for the test, homework, or just studying and the sports playing students usually throw all of that time in the trash. They just do not want to respect the help that all the adults at school and home give them. I believe that they just want to help themselves get to where they want to be, which we both know, are the sports fields. We should probably not interfere, but considering the lowering of this school GPA, we need to do something.

It is not me to tell an adult what to do, but I will tell you something. Not only is the school suffering from the bad choices such as procrastination, not creating quality work, and not using all of the help that adults have given them, but the future generations to come are at stake if we do not give this generation's children a good education. This policy must be enforced, or risk a de-progression into the cavemen eras.

Yours Truly,

STUDENT_NAME
