To: TEACHER_NAME,

Kids theses days have cell phones, and they also bring them to school. I think that you should let us kids use our cell phones during school because some kids will still use it anyways during class if you don't let us use it during school. I think that you should let kids use cell phones during lunch, brunch, and our free time because it is our free time and even though we are still in school we might get bored when we have free time. So when ever we get bored when we have free time then we can use our cell phones to text or call our friends or our parents. I think that it would make life a lot more easier during school if you would let us use cell phones at school. Even though school is for learning, during our breaks we are not learning anything. that is why I think that we should be allowed to have cell phones at school. If teachers want to they can also maybe have a container where they keep all the cell phones during class and when the class period is over then they can just get their phone from there. I think that is a good idea because then there will not be any kids texting, calling, or playing games on their phones they would just be working on their work. Plus there is a good side to having cell phones during school. When you are stuck somewhere and cant get out you can call someone on your cell phone to help you. Also maybe when you forgot a homework assignment at home or a project then you can just call one of your parents up for them to drop it off at school. Now that you have read my letter i hope that you will considerate changing the school policy to allow cell phones to be allowed during school when we have our free time.

Sincerely,
