Luke really enjoyed the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like helping people or takeing care of things thin this is the job for you. The Seagoing Cowboys helped take care of cows,hores, and mules that where over seas. Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece, that ment he could sing up for miliary service. He was on his cattle-boat trip when he signe u for the miliary. They had plenty of food and water to feed the anmials and themselves.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to travel a lot of places. Luck had been on 19 trips before they discharged him in 1947. If you like traveling then this is for you. They went all the way to China and it took them one whole month. They went to a lot of different places. Luck though all of his trips where very special.

Luck had come a long way since he was a kid. Luck grew up in in the country. He helped his aunt Katie out on the farm. He didn't have the best life when he was a kid. When Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy it opened up the world for him.

When Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy it was much more than an advernture even though he did travel a lot. Luke was very greatful for the opportunity. Luke saw that other countries don't have a lot of stuff like we do. He saw that they where in need. That awareness stayed with him almost his whole life.

Luke didn't just work he had a lot of fun on board. They played a lot of games like fencing, boxing, table-tennis tournaments, games, reading, and whittling made the time go by pretty quick. It was a lot easier to play the games when the animals where unloaded.

He sometimes went to places where war had just ended to help them in need. They also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty spaces where the animals usest to be.

Luke was a very kind harted person. He never though about just himself. He would go back and do it all over again. Luke was a very thoughful person. Tell me would you ever be a Seagoing Cowboy.
