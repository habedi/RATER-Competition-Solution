Why the face on Mars is just a Natural land form. 1976, Mars Global surveyer took an image on mars and it looked like shadowy likeness of a human face. So you can say that, but i think your wrong. The Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors it was short lived, and scientists think it was just another Martian esa.

Nasa says that it was probably a Lava dome that maybe made it look like a face. Scientists kept telling people that it was just Martian Mesa. In April 5th 1998, Micheal Malihn and his Mars Orbiter camera team snap the human like face 10 times to see if they could get another good look at the face. Thousand of web surfers were waiting for the picture could be on the jpl site. Then they had revealed that is was just a regular artifact.

It couldnt have been an created by aliens. Scientist said it was just the shadow giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Authors thought it would be a good way to to engage public and attract attention to Mars. And Mars got its Attention?

The face on mars had basically become something that everyone was talking about. It had appeared in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, radio talk shows, and magazines. It had Haunted the Checkout lines of grocery stores for years. So They tried it again.

April 8, 2001 it was a cloudy day in Cydonia. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution, and it still didnt work. The information a gave shows you that the human face figure was not true. Overall it had to have been a Lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.
