This essay will have many reasons to why the "Face on Mars" is just a natural landform created with the use of shadows to form what looks to be, a human face. Some people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens or any kind of life on Mars, and NASA is trying to keep the public from knowing.

The first reason is that it has been confirmed by NASA that the human face is just an illusion! This illusion created by shadows gives it the appearance of a human face. Now some people may believe that NASA is saying that it is an illusion because they want to hide that they have been given a sign of life in space. Most people do not know that if there was life on Mars then NASA would benefit, which I will speak more about in the next paragraph.

The second reason to convince you that the "Face on Mars" is just a landform is that if there was life on Mars, it would be no secret! NASA would financially benefit from life on Mars. Think of all the publicity NASA would get and how much money that would bring to them, they could fund a lot more programs and projects.

The third reason is that we can not question the power of the technology they have at NASA. NASA has taken several looks at the face and each time the results are the same. They have extraordinary cameras and photography technology at NASA. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, most common in the American West.

Although some people might still believe that the face is not just a landform, the facts show that it is just an illusion with shadows giving the appearance of a face. I hope this essay has enlightened you to what the "Face on Mars", really is.
