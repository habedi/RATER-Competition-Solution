Venus is the second planet from the sun and is very dangerous to explore because of its characteristics. In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author does a good job at describing the challenges NASA would face and how exploring Venus could lead to break throughs in science and space exploration.

In the article the authors states many challenges NASA would face and how if they were successful it could lead to the exploration of other planets. In the article the authors reason to explore Venus is " human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." The author is trying to explain to the reader that this could be the first step to space exploration and could lead to the exploration of the rest of our solar system. A mission to Venus would also lead to great break throughs in science. The new information and data found from collecting rocks and other materials on Venus could benefit many lives back on Earth. Exploring Venus would also create new understandings of science and physics and help scientist understand how different properties work with each other. This could lead to new medicines that could save lives all around world and could also lead to new technology that wold benefit humanity as a whole. New elements would be found which could also benefit humanity.

Exploring Venus could create new break throughs in science and the understanding of science. This could be a great use when developing new technologies that could benefit Earth and could lead to the exploration of other planets and even nearby solar systems.
