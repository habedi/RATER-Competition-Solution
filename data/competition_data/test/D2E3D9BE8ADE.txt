The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying that it was like Earth, it was probably covered with oceans and it could have supported various life forms. It can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Also simply because of human curiosity.

The first reason the author supports the idea of studying Venus is because it used to be like Earth. Venus had many features that Earth has like oceans, valleys, mountains, and craters. I know this because in the text it says "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This proves that the author would like to study Venus because it used to be like Earth.

Another reason why the author supports the idea is because we can probably visit Venus. In the article it states "Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit." This shows that the author thinks that once we learn more about Venus we can most likely visit it.

Lastly the author supports the idea to study Venus because of human curiosity. In the text he writes "but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." This shows that the author supports it because human curiosity will cause us to explore Venus. Also because in the text he also wrote "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts."

In conclusion the author supports the idea of studying Venus because it used to be like Earth. Venus had oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Also because it could be a nearest option for a planetary visit and because of human curiosity. Lastly, who wouldn't want to explore Venus or even visit it and find out more about its environment.
