I am for having teachnology in class rooms that can read peoples emotions.

If we have this tech we can have a better chance of preventing harmful situations. This will really help the special ed teachers because there is kids with emotional problems and if you can reach out to the students fast enough you can most likely prvent a issue. I thhink if we know what emotions someone is having we would have a better chance of helping them. I like the idea of helping others. We can improve are way of teaching others with this tech. It says in paragraph 1 " Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate." we need to leave it to the experts to help us find better ways to communicate with humans and computers.

If we are helping kids on this earth im all for this way of tech.
