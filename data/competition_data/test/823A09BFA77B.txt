Schools loves to see their students grow academically and know that they have accomplished new things through out the year. When it's time for summer break to begin, students will never pick up nor read another textbook again. The schools doesn't want their students to lose their knowledge over the course of their summer break. Some schools are recommending summer projects during the summer break to maintain their knowledge. Summer projects should be teacher designed project because they are able to reach out to the students and will also know what to expect from their students when they return.

Students tends to feel over whelmed when they can't function nor figure out anything educational. Therefore, teachers should help out by taking time out of their day to call the students to help them out with their projects. Daily calls from their teacher can help them concentrate more and to stay on task. Staying on task is important because, students will end up forgetting about their project throughout the summer break. By calling the students, teachers are able to answer any questions and concerns that the student may have ran into throughout the project.

An Addition, teachers will know what to expect from their students when they return back to school. Teachers would have the hard work done because they were able to plan out each individual assignment for the students. Teachers have been working with their students all throughout the year and know what to look forward to from their class. Teachers would know which students would need the most help. The teachers wouldn't have to back track on things that they've have already taught because they have helped them throughout the project.

Summer projects is a good way to keep the knowledge that the students learn during the school year locked in. Students wouldn't have to stress over any obstacles because they're teacher were there to help. Also, teachers would have it easier to grade things from the summer projects because they planned them way ahead. Students will also come back to school with the same knowledge that they left with from school back to school.
