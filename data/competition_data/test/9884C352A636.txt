My name is Luke and I think others should become Seagoing Cowboys like me because being a Seagoing Cowboy is a lot of fun. You get to go to places far away and help people that have been through some hard times because of World War II.

During World War II some people's houses were left to ruins and they had nothing left. Then while the people of Europe were trying to recover their food supplies and animals, 44 countries joined together to form the UNRRA. They made it so people called Seagoing Cowboys could take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas.

Me and my frien Don heard about Seagoing Cowboys and we emedeitly signed up. We were now offical Seagoing Cowboys. If anyone asked me if they should become Seagoing Cowboys I would say yes, I think everyone should become a Seagoing Cowboy if they ever got the chance.
