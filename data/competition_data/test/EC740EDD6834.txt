As summer starts to roll around, students usually start taking their school work less and less seriously. When students are in control of what they are doing, or working on, they are more likely to complete what they started. When a student gets assigned to complete something its harder for them to finish, or to start at all.

These summer projects should be student-designed because students tend to do better when they enjoy what they are working on. When teachers assign work for students to complete, they design it in a more complex manner rather than taking a simpler approach. Many students have more ideas which interest them, that the teachers might not consider, or think of when designing these projects. When teachers design these projects they lead to no benefits on either side. Students should be able to use their imagination and creativity while being on summer break as well as their knowledge.

Students are always limited when it comes to teacher-designed projects. Such as when a student is assigned something that does not pertain to their life or the real world. This always leads to inactivity or procrastination which then leads to no work being done at all. This also almost never interests the student which makes the work harder, and less easy to focus on. Over the course of a month or two, people in general tend to get bored of things quickly, so it is always good to be working on something that interests them, or that they enjoy.

Teacher-designed projects can also be a good thing as it can guide a student on where to start. It can also give them ideas on what to do, but it is also a gateway for them to not get as good of a grade as they could have gotten if they used their full potential. For example, when a student gets assigned to write a persuasive essay, they would most likely not incorporate any of their own ideas, but rather things they read from other sources. If the student wrote an auto biography on themselves that would spark their interest because it pertains to their own life. They would not have to go out of their way to use sources on something they do not care for.

All in all students should be in control of what they are working on in their own free time, a time especially like summer. When something like a summer assignment is assigned to a student they should automatically have the right to design their own project. They should be able to base their work off their own ideas. When a student is designing their own project they have the best way of knowing exactly what they are doing, which will lead to better results. Lastly they should not have to worry about meeting someones' expectations but their standards,so them designing their own project will lead to less stress as well.
