Dear Principal,

Many student in this school are in school sport because many of them may be able to do better on sport then other subject such as math, reading and writing or science and so on other subject in school . Student may have the only chance to go to college getting a scholarship in sport to graduate in college getting a good job in the future . Many be as close to a B average as they can get and still not be participating in sports because they did not make a B average in the school subject they may have miss some school day and fell behind and did not turn in the work but still what to participate in the sport or other after school activities because of what happen in losing a couple class work . Maybe take time off practice of sport or activities and take them out to do there class work.

Many student will improve there grade just to be sport or there after school activities because they like the field trips they get to go with there friend or team to win games to travel different places and try new thing. they made decide to go to college to get a scholarship in sport or other school activities that allow them to win a scholarship in a college they may not the resource to pay to go to college and winning a sport or school activities in a scholarship and this maybe this be the only way to there to then improve there life style getting s good job when there adults. They may set explain for other in life.
