Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should let us have cell phones in school. Cell phones could be useful in times of needs. Like if they have a person in the school, who shouldn't be there, We (The Students) could call the cops incase if the teacher doesn't have no device to make calls with. There wouldn't be anyone else there to make the call

When Its school times we can just turn them off, so that they won't distract the other kids from learning. We all know phones can be distracting when your phone come on, but its just a little distraction. It doesn't mean that their just going to forget the subject all the sudden.

People just know that when kids have cell phone during school time all were going to do is text during class. Its not true because there wouldn't be no point of school if your just going to text during class the whole day.

Actually, when you're texting, the phone will show you that's your making errors and you will eventually correct yourself. That is almost like the subject English. In ELA, don't we correct sentences and stuff like that? Its just like texting your friends. You have to send them messages with correct spelling.

So all I say is that we should just have cell phones during school. It can help us in the future one day.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
