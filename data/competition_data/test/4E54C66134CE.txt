useing technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom to identify human emotions in class .

personal i think that would be a great idea and would help out a lot. it states that "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored ," that could help in a lot of ways . if you computer could do that it would help many students to get more involved in the class work and not lose anybody with lack of understanding or any other reason .

it can even tell the diffrence between a genuine smile and a forced one . it says that in a real smile a muscle called the zygomatic major lifts the corners of your mouth. when a smile is forced the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a diffrent muscle.

i feel like this would help alot in some cases to keep everyone involed it would help teachers know when someone isnt on the same page or doesnt understand, and the teacher can adress that . so yea its a great idea
