Hello principal I do believe that school's our school should have cell phones in school when ever kids have extra time cause its important to have an time to communicate with our fellow students and that's one good and easy way. An example we can call our parents if we need some thing or text them for emergency's, or just to say I love you. Say no ones perfect and if you are a really person you do forget things and what one good way to get what you need when you leave something? Text your mom during lunch time.

People at school get hurt all the time and say the office needs to know your mom or dad's cell phone and they didn't put it on the card? We students could use our phones so nothing bad would really happen cause you mom is all ready here and got what you need. I think we should have phones at school to call for rides and call home to see if we can go with our friend or say some guy comes and say your mom wanted me to pick you up and you didn't know him? If you had your cell phone with you, you can call her up and see if this is true or not so have an cell phones could keep you safe for many reasons.

I gladly agree that some of our fellow students use their cell phones for many good and bad reasons and their not going to stop even if you stop for good they would try and try to and some of them will do and succeed, so why stop forever? Texting is our generation cell phones is what this society lives with. School's across the world would want all the kids coming to school, seeing the attence go up by a bunch
