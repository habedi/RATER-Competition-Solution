In the article D'Alto states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson.."

The Facial Action Coding System could change how students would learn. This technology would help students excel and grow to become more intelligent individuals. This could help the following generations behind us smarter and more understanding. This facial coding system can help students achieve their learning goals in the classroom. This new technology would be valuable in the classroom for students.
