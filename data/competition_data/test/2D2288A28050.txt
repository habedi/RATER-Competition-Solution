I think one reason to join is because he helped people who needed the help beacause in the strory World War 2 just ended and some people needed help getting their country's or city's back together. Another reason is because he got to go on an adventure by traveling on a boat with cattle, horses, and more. Also he had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also he visited many unique places while he was on the trip as he did in the story.

Luke claims these reasons by telling the reader how he felt being on the trip and telling them how he helped all of these peaople. Also he told us why he kept on going out and doing/helping anyone he could. Another way he claimed his reason's is by telling us how and what he did on his free time from wherehe was at. Also his emotion tells us how he claimed some parts of his reason's.

I belive that this show how Luke claim's his reason's because one he used his emotion by saying how he felt when he was there. Second He said that he had a fun and adventurious time at sea caring for the horses and other farm animals. Also last bot not least he told us what he did on his free time witch was go explore and get tours of special building's that were/are special to the people who live there.
