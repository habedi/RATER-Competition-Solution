I think that the kids our age would be very disappointed to be kept from playing the sports selected for our school. Mainly because that most of the kids in the school don't have that opportunity at home. they don't have a tennis court, or a golfing range, a basketball court, nor a pool. In my opinion, i think we are very lucky to have the option to play the sports we like, or think we can be very good at because then later on in our college recommendations there would be no sports selected. See, for kids our age we look for electives we think we can be good at, or already have an act for. As like a side dish before going home to cooking, cleaning, babysitting, etc...

In my opinion i like tennis and basketball. I am on the bentwater tennis team, but they don't have a basketball team. That's why i tried out for the team last year. But this year i need to focus on my art, so I've given up basketball for this year and throughout high school I'm taking tennis for the team. And i don't think its fair to have kids have at least a grade B to participate in sports, cause my true opinion is that kids now, want to focus on their electives, mainly because its the side dish that they picked, knowing they HAVE TO have history, algebra, language arts, and science. But when their in that class they actually desire it gives them the perseverance to try harder in their other subjects. So if they don't have a B in a class, lets say its a C, so what? Eventually with the help that's required, i think it should be eligible for them to take the sport. Give them a reason to try harder in the sport, and in class. Lets just say that if they want to keep taking that sport, they have to go to tutoring twice a week, or three times a week. Plus some kids, need a way to cope with all the drama going on at home, or the bullying between other kids.

Some kids get bullied because of their weight, their clothes, anything, or maybe its just because the kids bullying them are just jealous. But the kids that are having to deal with that, need a way to get away from it all. In athletics it can be just running to let out your frustrations, or swimming just to cleanse your body of all the weight put on you at home, or tennis, just to wack the ball as hard as you can across the court to let out your anger. See in some way we all need a way to let out our emotions that we have bottled up inside of us. Me? My way is art. I've drawn so many things that i bet you cant even recognize, they might just be blobs of stuff, or skulls, or maybe even flowers, roses, happy faces, rainbows, when I'm happy. There is a way for everyone to let out their frustrations, and most people resolve those issues with sports. So i honestly don't think its fair for you to take away the sports academic program, let alone make us have the grades to get in. In some way, the grades we make are our choice, and you don't have us have all B' s to get into any other elective, why sports? And if you pass this school policy, i will bet you that there isn't gonna be as much kids as there would be even for just a team.

You can ask any kids that goes here, and i will be you 99.9% of them would say this policy is unspoken for, not fair and probably agree with what I've been trying to explain with this letter of recommendation. So now that i think i have gotten my point across, and you can actually see where im coming from im going to close this letter with a few words of my opinion. '' Thank you for letting my write this, let alone having the time to read it, and i honestly don't think
