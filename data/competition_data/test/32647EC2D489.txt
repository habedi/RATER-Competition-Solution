Do you hear that? Do you hear it now? It's the freedom of being able to change the cell phone policy. Cell phones are disruptive and loud but, they are also good for certain tasks. Your cell phone can keep record of important dates, you can store notes, and you can use for emergencies. Cell phone aren't all bad they do have there pro's to situations.

To begin with, your cell phone has a calendar that you could set appointments or big test or dates due for project. It could help you bring up grades because at time you may forget when something is due and then you not turn it in and get a intolerant grade. This could cause you to fail and not succeed. Therefore, that is my first reason I am fighting for the right to have phones at school.

Second of all, it can help you keep important notes or references in the memory of your phone. It can reduce the cutting of trees and it helps us use less paper that most people don't recycle. It helps our planet as a benefit to it all. Its quick and easy and always handy. So in my opinion, I believe that keeping notes in your phone instead of paper would be much better.

Last of all, it can be used in emergencies. For example what if you are walking around campus and something happens to someone and you can't find help. You can use your cell phone to call for help or assistance in the matter. It can help if you have a relative who is in the hospital or could be dying. That is why I believe we should be able to have phones at school.

To conclude, I believe that the cell phone policy should be changed. It helps in so many ways. As in keeping records of important dates and such forth, you can stoe notes, and you can use them in cases of emergencies. If it were to change it would be of great use to many people. Do you believe it should be changed?
