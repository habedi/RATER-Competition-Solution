To the Principal :

I can tell you many reasons why not to change the schools policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average . I mean there's lots of student's that love sports and many other activities that have a C grade average and they can't make the team even thou they are really good at that sport or activity. like i remember when i tried out for the soccer team at my old school i mean i was pretty good back then and even thou i had a very high C grade average they still didn't let me play for the team even thou the coach wanted me on the team the school didn't let me in it.

i mean the only thing I'm asking is for to be a little bit lenient whit the student's in the school. Because even thou some great athletes have very poor grades they still might bring their grades up if u tell them that they would let u stay in the team for one grading period till they get their grades up .
