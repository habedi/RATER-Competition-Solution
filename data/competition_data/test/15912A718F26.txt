I agree with the principle, because I think that kids should be active. Kids born in like 2003-2007 stay in all day with a phone in there hand, sometimes they forget to eat because they are to busy watching other peoples lives through a screen when they can do the same thing by going out side. I also think that kids should participate in after school programs because it opens up their young mind to different things like photography some people may not like photography till they try it out and if they try it and like it they like it they stay but if they are not interested they can try some thing else.

Personally I like my schools after school program because next year I'll Be a freshman in high school and I want to play football and my school has a program that you go to to lift weight. But they don't let join then lift you have to go through some kind of training where you have to do four week of training to touch a weight because they want you to be safe they don't want you to get hurt and not play football next year. Something that is Special about this club it's run by the high school coaches who are also gym teacher here at my school. My school also has a basketball team we play a school in Generic_City named Generic_School. My school Generic_School And Generic_School have a little rivalry. But My schools basketball team has tryout so they can get the best kids that my schools has so we can beat Generic_School. Really I think my school made a basketball team to let the kids have fun.

I also think other schools need after school programs because some schools are placed in a bad area and the might live in bad areas with guns, gangs, and violence, but if they make an after school program and encourage kids to go you'll be pulling them from all the violence or joining a gang and doing drugs. Some kids have had to move schools and house just so their child does not become a gang member. I know some people who have ha to move because they lived in a bad neighborhood and their mom and dad pulled them out of school to come to a better school. I thin the principal is just helping the kids enjoy school more and is also helping them stay out of trouble.

In conclusion, I think the principle is right because I think the principle is just trying to make school fun for kids and help the kids stay active. Therefore i agree with the principals decision to make an after school program.
