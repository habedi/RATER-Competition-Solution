The Challenge of Exploring Venus.

Venus is one of the brightest star at night. Second planet to our sun. Human have sent many spacecraft to venus but it never landed there because spacecraft couldn't stay longer then few hours. All the mission is unmanned. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket venus. Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The National Aeronautics and space administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending human to study venus. Peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far baove the planet can provide only limited insight on gorund condition because most form of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard form of photography and videography ineffective. Resercher cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, form distance. That why scientist seeking to conduct a thorugh mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk.
