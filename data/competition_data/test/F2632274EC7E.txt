Phones & Driving

Texting and driving has become a huge issue. Many car accidents have occurred by being on the phone. Most people think texting and driving is not a serious thing but in reality, it has caused many lives. Police have been cracking down and a lot on this situation. Phone companies like Apple have put a do not disturb setting on the phone for driving. You turn it on and it will silence all calls and texts messages, so it won't temp you to pick up your phone. Many teens have been in an accident due to texting and driving. This has become a dangerous issue in society that has caused many lived and needs to be stopped.

In this paragraph I am going to be talking about the dangers that texting and driving have. Currently 46 states have banned texting and driving due to many accidents. This problem is occurring a lot with young teens. Many teens don't know how to put their phone down while driving they feel they need to always have it in their hand. 21% of teen drivers who were involved in fatal car accidents were distracted by their cell phones. 330,000 injuries arise each year from texting a driving. There are many organizations dealing with texting and driving. They also have addictions programs if you are addicted to your phone and cannot put it down. Phone addiction is a real thing, many people struggle with and don't realize it. Sources say that "94% of drivers support imposing a ban on texting while driving". It has been proven that texting while driving its 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk and that really should tell you something. This is huge problem that can be solves so easily if people would just put their phone down.

Many car companies have been making self-driving cars. This makes people think it is okay to be on their phone while driving because the car is driving itself when in realty it is just as dangerous. I think texting white driving is a horrible thing I think it should be banned. I say this because many have died and many more were injured. It should not be allowed at all it puts the person that's driving in danger and other drivers. I think that police cracking down on texting and driving is a good thing. It will make more people stop doing it if they know they will get a ticket or possibly jail time. People will not stop until they know it will be serious consequences, they don't take it as a big deal. Research also shows that when people are talking on the phone, crash risk quadruples. The national safety council estimated that cellphone use leads to more than 1.6 million crashes every year. A first offence of texting while driving is 50 or more. I think that price needs to be much high then 50 dollars. I say this because if tickets were higher like maybe 100 or more lots of people wouldn't be texting and driving because they wouldn't want to pay that high ticket.

In conclusion I think texting and driving is a horrible thing that needs to be stopped. How many more lives is it going to take before people see how horrible it is. As a society we need to do better for our safety. We need to stop being so distracted by our phones and focus on making it where we need to go safely. The biggest age group affected by this problem is aging from 16 to 30. We need our young teens and our adults to do better and learn to put the phone down for their own safety. In the end we all want our country to be better and safer place. We want to live are life to the fullest and enjoy the good times so we should start thinking wise and be safer and it can start by not texting while driving.
