NASA is a goverment funded project that uses science facts, pictures, and advanced technology. NASA has been constintally working hard and, according to the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars."

"NASA's Viking 1 spacraft was snapping photos of possible landing sights for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face." As soon as NASA saw the picture they instantly started going to work to see what it was.

NASA has already created scientific technology for this reason. They would want to get the best looking picture and the most acccurate one. The acticle states, "Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." The first immage they snapped revealed that it was nothing but a landform, but still people were not satisfied. On April 8, 2001 another photo was captured at the cameras maxium view. Each pixil spanned 1.56 meters, compard to Vikings 43 meters per pixel

NASA has been specifically designed to explore outer space and to discover what was there. They have been working even before 1976, Thats more than 40 years! They have only had a number of break throughs, proving that NASA would not hold back information about ancient civilizaions or alien lifeform because it would be a great breakthrough. The defenders of the NASA budget even wished there was an ancient civilization on mars. There was a degree of suprise for mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared. They were fascinated by what they saw.

The alien conspiercy believers may reject the pictures and say they have been tampered with. NASA would not do that, however. They have already spent loads of money for this project and made all the equipment. They would not go through all that trouble just to lie to the public. NASA also took may pictures with their instruments from many angles and different views. They are high resolution photographs and they even have 3D alimetry, according to the article "Unmasking the Face of Mars."

Overall, NASA is an important space project that is honest and truthful about their work. They prove their claims with scientific facts and photos. They have the brains, tools, and budget that allows them to do that. If the public is not happy with their results they will find a different way to show it and find more evidence that will satisfy them.
