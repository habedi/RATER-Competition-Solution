Dear principle,

My opinion on this policy change will not let most students play sports. A lot of students have a C average because a C means your still passing, and you are an average student. Some people might be affected because a learning disability such as dyslexia, and it has not been noticed but they try their hardest. This can go both ways to for or against. This can go both ways because the principle is trying to weed out the kids that are lazy, and don't want to work in school and just play sports. In my opinion i think the policy should not be changed because it would take away from some kids because of their disability's, and those children should have that opportunity. I agree with both sides, but I think not changing the rule would make more sense. Both sides do have a valid argument in the matter.

That is my opinion on the principles policy change. Both sides have a valid argument, and that the policy should not be changed for kids with a learning disability that has not been recognized.
