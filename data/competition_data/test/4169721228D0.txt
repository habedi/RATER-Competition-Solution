In this day and age a significant amount of technological advances are being created to help people, but a technological advance that would do more harm than help is online classes for students. People may argue that online classes will give students more time to complete assignments, but it will develop bad habits such as poor time management and procrastination. Students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it provides easier access to cheat, make it difficult to learn, and if the internet is down students can't do their assignments.

Online classes will give students easy access to cheat on assignments, quizzes, and tests. When a student cheats it shows that they do not understand the material given. To put things into perspective, if I were to cheat on an exam, I would only do so if I did not understand the material. By allowing students to take online classes will increase the amount of cheating tremendously. All in all, students cannot gain anything from cheating.

Students taking online classes will come to the realization quickly that it is much more difficult to learn. For example, if the student does not understand the content he or she can't ask a question to the teacher immediately. This may cause the student to get frustrated and give up. It takes an immense amount of dedication to be able to succeed when taking online classes. Ultimately, students may struggle with learning the material when taking an online course.

Online classes cannot be accessed without internet. This becomes a problem because if the student does not have internet they cannot learn the material and they will not be able to complete their work. Also another problem with this is that many students may not know how to resolve their internet issues to allow them to do their work. This all could have been easily avoided if the class was taken in person rather than online.

In conclusion, there are many issues that are surrounded with taking online classes such as providing easier access to cheat, more difficult to learn the material, and if the internet is not working students cannot complete their assignments. These issues just stated can be avoided by taking classes in person as it will make the learning process less complicated.
