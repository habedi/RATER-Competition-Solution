Would Google make things easy by making a driverless car or would you stick with a normal passenger car? In my understanding I never knew google was trying to make a way to have driveless cars. Im thinking is it safe, will it help with transportation, and will it be alot of technology problems to control. Here is reson why that might be good to have driveless cars.

First,Google been working on this project for years. In the passege, it says," Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."Google is trying to find companies that are willing to help or have some type of different thing that would make driveless cars better and smarter. In the text, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special tets track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the cars.

Here are reason they might not be good to have. In paragrph 2, it says," Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with complicated traffic issues". Are they reliable for navigation or accidents? Google thinks by using laser and updated sensors would help the car." The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there", said in paragraph 6.

Google is trying to help and make ways to have good, easy technology. "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written with the assumpton that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."

In conclusion, Google and other companies are trying to make things better for people in this world with new technology. Is it good for them to make this is type of product or new machineries? This story tells everything about it and if its right for people in communies safety. I think it might be good to have driverless cars. Do you think its good to have driverless cars?
