School is a topic that is a widely debated topic around the world and over the ages of its development. Schools have vastly been improved by: being a nonexistent topic in ages before education was deemed important, to descriminative and only socially excepted for people lacking color, to segregated in more recent years, to the modern day vision of what a complete education is. Now, more recently, people are pushing for the education system to be improved to the point of not even having to leave your houses; although this may be true, school, over the time and with past experiences, has proved to be the best of the options. Geniuses in the past have learned their smarts and gained the knowledge theyre so well known for, through a school system. People like Albert Einstein did not have resources such as laptops, and in home schooling, to learn the information he did to become one of Americas greatest minds. Why change a system that isn't broken?

Attendance and grades are one thing that shape the school system into what it is; if a student isn't there to learn, what will the teacher be able to teach? Counties often have problems with attendance rates to this day. As students get older and more able, they skip more often. This causes grades to possibly slip and schools be held accountable for students they have no control over when on their own premises. Online schooling would only increase this problem. Laziness and lack of effort in ones home could cause rates of attendance over laptops to plummet. Schools will be held accountable for students in the hours of their classes, but in reality have no way of monitoring their safety. Real life schooling can decrease this problem by giving students a safe and comfortable environment to surround themselves with to learn the things necessary for their future success.

Grades are a component of the schooling system that have a heavy part in the students success rate in their elementary, to high school career. Many, honor codes are placed in schools today in attempts to minimize the number of unjust grades or scores in high school. More than often, cheating is a problem that is hard to prevent when in school, the rates would only skyrocket if students where able to take tests in their own spaces. Trust and honesty in the school system between students, administrators, and students would be diminished. Trust is key in many scenarios involving student and superior relationships, without the trust, and with the increase of unfair grading, schools would be bias and begin giving unjust grades to students ill deserving.

A students future is something that should be in the front of their minds throughout their whole high school careers. Most jobs and careers in the field today require high amounts of human interaction. People who lack social skills and learn these skills also in school would be lucking out and compromising the futures they possibly have ahead of them. Social skills and human interaction is something that is unable to be taught and understood over a laptop. In students future years, as they begin to attend universities and find jobs, they have to know proper etiquette and how to present themselves in a professional manner. Without these life lessons, people can be viewed as unprofessional and unstable at times where they need to give their best impressions.

Many may argue that online schooling and classes are more accessible for lower income people; however, schools more so than not, go far lengths to make sure a child has transportation to the school they attend. Many of Americas best philosophies and smartest minds have come out of the school system. The past has shown and proven to us the the school system is effective. In-class schooling is the best option for students because of the need for attendance while learning a concept, the fair grading system, as well as the need of learning social skills over their lifetimes. The school system is an effective one with success rates through the roof, there shouldn't be any need to change Americas worldwide system of learning when the possible change could be for the worse and not the better.
