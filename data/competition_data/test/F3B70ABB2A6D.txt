The Problem With Phones In The Car

There is a worldwide problem with phones being used while driving. This is a major problem because this how many car accidents are started. Many are injured and are also even killed from this problem. There are many states which have implicated the Hands-Free law which is good, because now people know that it is bad to text/ use your phone. Thus bringing us to the case that phones are bad to use while driving.

Phones being used while driving is a distraction, period, point, blank. They're a distraction because you would have to look at a screen instead of the road, which would then have you unaware of you surroundings and possibly take a life for this distraction. Phones are a distraction because they are a temptation, a temptation to loom at the screen. This temptation can lead to a bad accident, which could then lead to death.

Something that has been helping people use their phone is having a bluetooth device connected and use that instead of picking the phone up. This is why the Hands-free law has been implicated. This is a great law that has began being implicated, the reason being that you can be stopped before an accident actually happens. It is also good because now people are more aware about their surroundings while driving.

Their have been many accidents a year that have lead to death and it is bad because these were countless lives taken for a very dumb mistake. This is a worldwide problem, like i said before, and it is becoming more and more dangerous for people to drive and walk around the crosswalk.

In conclusion, I believe that i have sufficed the argument that phones are NOT fine to have, in usage, in a car. Hopefully this essay helped you understand that it isn't worth it. All the accidents and deaths over using a phone.
