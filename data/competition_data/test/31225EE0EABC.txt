In my opinion, I think students should design their own summer projects. To start off, If you, a student have an assignment that doesn'tÂ interest you at all, it would make a huge difference if you could make it on something that interests you. Furthermore it is also summer so it would be fitting to give the students a bit of freedom and let them make a project that they'll have fun with. The last thing a student would want on summer break is to be stuck with a stressful or boring project.

Another reason why I think students should choose their own projects is because they could make it on what they are doing over their summer break, for example if a student is at a beach in a different country they can make it on the different types of wild life that live there. Which would make it far more easier for the student to do since it would be about them and what they are doing over break. In addition to this students won't have to stress over doing research on it since it's about what they're doing. But if they do happen to do some research it would be on what the student is interested in. And because the student can choose their own project the options are endless since it could be on pretty much anything.

In addition to my previous statement, because students will have the option to choose on what their project will be on, and not some boring project the teachers will hand out. More students will be inclined to do their projects and turn them in and on time. studies have also shown teens are 80% more likely to get things done when it's something they actually care and are interested about. With students choosing their own projects teachers will receive quality projects and the students will start off the year with a good grade to go with it.

Finally, with students choosing their projects they will have more options on what to do and how they want to do them. this will also make the required summer project much easier for students because it will be around what they are interested in and enjoy. And is way better than having to do a stressful project that a teacher can give out on a topic that students could care less about. Also giving students the chance to choose their own project will let them show how creative they are with it and how much more effort will be put into it. These are my reasons on why summer projects should be student designed.
