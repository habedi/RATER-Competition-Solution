If there was projects over the summer, They should be constructively divided between the Teachers and Students, because there would be more creativity and fun for the projects. If you let either side take full or majority of the planning and development, it could be least interesting to either side. Lets say the teachers come up with a boring Science project to do over the Summer with a bunch of Worksheets, the students will not enjoy that. That being said the Teachers most likely don't want to grade too much work , they would prefer it to be simple and fun. Depending on age and grades, I believe grades 6+ should have students and teachers create projects and Ideas , It'd also allow the teachers and students bond a little more and help them with other school activities. Grades 5 and under should have summer projects but have more creative teachers in the role, considering the students are still very young. If you start giving students projects when they are younger they could develop and already learn those skills needed for projects and school work. Different schools, counties, and states can differ on such school activities. For most Schools and Counties they should be possible to do these projects it just needs a combined effort from both the Students and Teachers.
