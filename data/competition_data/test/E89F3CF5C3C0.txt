Think about it, people all over the world are constantly getting themselves stuck in natural disasters losing lots of the things they need to survive. In passage 2 it says, " To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more''.

All this does is help recover families who have lost family members animals or shelter. most of the people cant survive without their food. Being a seagoing cowboy can be more than helping families but can spread the love and hope of God. In passage 9 it sais " But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him." Im grateful for the opportunity'' he says."

Now think if you were in this situation, wouldnt you want to have hope, know someone cares, restore the broken. It would also be challenging to try to live without food no to animals to even rely on for food. Think of someoneyou love, think about if they died. wouldnt you want people to come contfor you. It would also just be a fun experience getting to see new places if not before.

In conclusion if you wouldnt like to loose family, friends, or animals you rely on or just love come help those who have went through those times. Why dont you show those people that you care and want to help. So now what do you think about joinging UNRRA.
