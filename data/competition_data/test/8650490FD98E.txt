Dear principal,

Some of my friends are participating in community service and some are not. I decided to write you a letter on whether they should or whether they should not. I think that we should because it's kind and it will probably get into good news when we go to college. If we didn't have community helpers I think that the community would turn bad and look disgusting and if were to get like that who would ever want to live there?

Community service is not a punishment it should be thought as way to help nature and the community. Community service should take place in everyone's lives at some point and what better way is there if we just start at a young age. Community service also matures people and make them choose the right direction in life, that's why when a teen gets into trouble and has to go to court the judge usually send them to do community service for however many hours, and sometimes the teens come out totally different because they see how they can do better things than get into trouble.

Community service has a lot of activities that we can do. And with all the different choices for everyone it shouldn't be that hard to choose one. Principal what I am trying to say is that Community service not only helps the community it helps us too, and i think that we all should participate in it. For example my friend works at the humane center because she love animals, and she does this all in her spare time. Her mom told me when she is done with her homework she goes straight to the humane center, she really enjoys it there. She is not like the typical teenager you see now, she doesn't hang out at the mall, she doesn't go to her friends house after school, and that's all because she found a community service that she loves.

Well that's all i really have to say about my opinion, hopefully I see change in the status quo. Thank you so much.

Have a nice day,
