Do you think students must particitpate in an extracurricular activity? I think making students do an activity would allow student to make new friends and interact with othe students that they may not know.

Some examples of extracurricular activities include sports, working on a yearbook, participating in a musical, or joing clubs that intrest you. I think that students should be able to pick an activity that they like. Making students do an extracurricular activity teaches them life skills like learning how to work with other people and having responsibilities.

Making students do an activity gives students something to do after school. Some students go home and they play video games or do nothing. Also I can build relationships with teamates. Extracurricular activites use teamwork like in basketball you pass the ball to your teamate and they score. Joing a team of club can be a way to make new friends. Being on a team or in a club could make you less lonely because you are around people you know. When you are on a team to be able to play you have to have good grades. So making students do an extracurricular activity could encourge students to try to get good grades. Lets say there is a new student and they dont have many friends going a team or club might make some new friends. Some students want to do something extracurricular because they get bored at home. My parents sometimes force me to try a new sport and at first i don't like it but at the end I like the sport. It encourgaes students to try new things like one year you play basketball and the other year you chose to do something way different.

This is a way you can find the activities you like and don't like.

Students use way to much technology a day and an activity is a way to get away from technology for a little bit. Extracurricular activites is a way to clear your head about school work or stuff going on at home.

On the flip side sports and other activites can cause stress in school and may cause you to be tired. After school im super tired and I want to rest. I also think students should be allowed to chose if they want to an activity because what if there working a job and they have to fit the activity and the job in after school. Some students can't do activities because they have watch there siblings after school because their parents work late. When you have sports or other activities you might have to stay up late because you did not do your homework.

Some students say an extracurricular activity makes they stay in school longer. If the principal enforced making students do an activity there would be some parents that would dissagree.

Making students do an extracurricular activity has is pros and its cons but I think the pros out way the cons. Doing extracurricular activity's teaches you about teamwork and responsibilities. It also encourages students to get good grades and you also learn about the activity your doing. Students would learn how to play the sport or how to do the activity. I think this would be a great thing to have at our school because all students would have something to do after school. You could also learn about different sports of clubs you can join I think making students do an activity would allow student to make new friends and interact with other students that they may not know.Â
