Parents always want to make the best decisions for their kids, whether it is homeschooling them or enrolling them into an actual school. Many students would rather be enrolled into a school than to be sitting at home all day video calling a teacher. Attending classes at home would not benefit students because they would lack social skills, less help, along with not fulfilling certain academic skills.

One of the biggest parts of taking classes at school are meeting new people and making connections with people. Bonding with friends and teachers can make a big impact on a students life, and not having the ability to do that can make a difference. Without social skills even the smallest tasks, like asking for help or greeting someone, could be nerve racking or difficult. During school I have needed to ask teachers or friends so many questions, because I did not understand the unit. The ability for me to ask peers and adults for help is a great gift that I greatly appreciate in my life. Social skills have helped me in so many situations that I could not have done myself if I were to take classes from home.

Attending classes from home may be less stressful on students because of less distractions and less people, but there is very little to no extra help. Taking classes at home is only the student and the teacher on a singular call. There are not nearly enough sources to obtain help from when taking classes at home. Whenever I am in need of help I would ask my friends or ask the teacher and they would give me an abundance amount of sources for help on whatever I am struggling on. When home schooled it is different and there is limited amount of help provided. Everyone deserves the help they desire for classes and that is a benefit of kids going to school for learning instead of home.

Taking part in school is an experience that everyone should go though and grow from. School develops so many academic skill sets that students learning from home would never have. Not having these academic skills could hurt the students learning from home. In schools they all have certain rules to follow with how to learn and act around others. At home they may be completely different. Once they enter the world outside their house it may be hard on the students because it is entirely different. When I had advanced from middle school to high school I thought it was a hard enough transition. I cannot imagine going from home schooled into the real world. The academic skills at schools need to be brought upon the students learning at home so they can understand what everyone else does.

The benefits students would have learning at school over at home is not even a question. Schools provide so much in many more ways than home. Schools provide students with better social skills, academic skills, and more help towards students who are in need of it. Home schooling students may not be a bad decision for some kids, because of certain situations, like disabilities and mental health, but most schools have programs and certain teachers who are more than willing to help those students learn and expand more. Overall learning and taking classes in school is a much better decision than at home.
