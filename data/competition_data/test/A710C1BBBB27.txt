No, Participation should be earned in classes and treated that way student may not like the activities to offer and may would slowly effect there grade leaving many student to become upset with there grades. Ways students could earn participation is for in class work or volunteering around the school . Not every one would like to do the year book, Student council, and sports there instead might go to other things the school has to offer. Many student will lose intresed in the activities there doing and will quickly start disliking it leading them to not wanting to do it anymore.

Students grades may suffer if they dont do a sport and or participating in the year book some student may have other interests other than sports or student council. In the school tear grades will become a struggle for many students not getting participation in classes and some student may possibly have the chance of failing. Ways student could earn participation is with class work around the school and helping with fundraisers and other events. Participation would have a big effect on students leaving them to fail if not doing so thus grading participation should be changed a little so many students grade may not have to suffer just for them not doing a year book and other activities.

Volunteering for the school should earn a student some participation and to go to school events would earn them more depending on how big of an event. Student the provide there time into going to a school event would earn participation point every time that person goes and to make it more interesting the student will be rewarded with something at a certain amount of participation. The more a student spends time at events the more participation point with go to there grade. If a student dose not go to a school event instead of putting them as a failing grade they will just nit get any of the extra points they would not earn for not going to the school event so the student wont fail the grade. Not going to the event wont affect the students grades.

Some of not many student wont be interested in the events they have to do for participation due to that a students grade may suffer instead of having to do the event there not interested in that student will have an option to do extra things around the school. Like wise the student may not like the task so instead of the student getting a bad grade for not doing it that person just will not earn the participation points needed to earn and pass the grade. Different activities will earn the student a different amount of points the student will have more than just a few options and can choose from small extra thing to do around the school to earn small participation point or do a big help around the school to get a lot of participation points around the school. Having a student not interested in some yet not many of the things to do will just leave them with a little less of participation around the school and may lead to not passing a grade.

In conclusion, student have a choice pass the grade with a lot of participation points and going up a grade or failing and having to be held back for another year. Many student struggle with participation so ti think it being a big part of your grade would be very much foolish. Some of the student today dont do much participation but do a lot of class work with some times leads them to summer school and doing work but just not participating there. Some students may be shy and not want to participate in class but may want to do a one on one time with the teacher to earn those points they missed leading to them getting up to the points they need but just nit enough to pass. So student participation should be and option more or less than just a grade in its self and having many student suffer for not doing it and having them held back for some time just to go through it again and to do the extra work but no t get a grade for participation in class.
