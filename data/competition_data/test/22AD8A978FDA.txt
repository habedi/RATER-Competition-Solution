Dear principal,

I am writing this letter to you about the new school policies on cell phones. Each policy has their pros and cons, and I want to give you my opinion on which will benefit the teachers and we the students. I hope you take this letter into consideration.

I will first talk about Policy 1. Policy 1 benefits the students greatly, we would be able to call and text our friends when we couldn't be together. Some phones even have internet, so we could surf the web on our own free time. Other types of phones have fun games too.

Some of the problems of this policy are some students might lose or someone may steal it. That student may blame the school, which would put some pressure on you to change the policy on cell phones. Students could also not turn their phone off and bring it to class. They would text their friends and not pay attention to important topics in class. People that have internet on their phone could look up answers and cheat. I think this policy is good, but could have some problems in the future.

Now on to Policy 2. Policy 2 is good for teachers and is ok for students. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids bringing their cell phones to class. Students wouldn't get distracted by their phones at times when they don't need them. They wouldn't have to worry about losing them or someone stealing their phone, and have to waste money on a new one. The cons of this policy is that some students still may sneak their phones and use the features of their phone when the teacher is looking. Some students need to call their parents after school, and without a phone, they don't know where there ride home is. This policy is also good, but no matter which policy, there could be a problem.

Out of the two policies, I think Policy 1 is the best. I need my phone everyday so i can call my parents to pick me up after my sports activities. Good students will be thankful that you chose this policy and obey the rules, turning off their cell phones during class time. If a student does break the rules and bring a phone to class, you should confiscate it for a certain period of time. If a student's phone gets stolen or he/she loses it, its their own fault and the school can't be blamed for it. This is my opinion, and i hopes it's yours too, if this policy fails the school, then by all means, try Policy 2.

Sincerely, Your Student
