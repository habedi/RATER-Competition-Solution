Dear principal,

Do you want the children to be uneducated? I know they go to school to get knowledge. But they even need extra help at home when their parents can't help them for their homework. Imagine if children needed help with their homework and their parents were not their to help them. What would they? So if someone is there to help them then the children will not have to stress about their homework. Even if they help cleaning the litter, that would make a world a better place. Our community would look good. And what's the problem if they help clean up litter, help children, baby sit. For example if the children parents are not home, and they need someone to take care of their baby, then you will need a baby sitter to do that. And what is so wrong about that. So that is my opinion about requiring all students to perform community service.

Sincerely,

Student
