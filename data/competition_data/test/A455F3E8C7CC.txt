The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Its just a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. It was put out in the public to draw attention to Mars and to make NASA budget increase.

The Face On Mars has become a big pop icon and starred in HollyWood film's,books,magazines, and radio talk shows. In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to get a picture better than the originals but when they did snap the pictures it revealed a natural landform. People who still believed it was an alien artifact was not satisfied they believed alien markings were hidden by haze. When MGS decided to go for a second look they found that in a digital image 3 times bigger you could see if there was objects of any kind or Egyptian style pyrmaids and there was none.

The picture shows is a normal landform common the equivalent to a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa on earth around the American West.
