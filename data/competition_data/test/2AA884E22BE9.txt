I think Venus is worth studying because maybe in the future us humans can live in venus. Earth and Venus are close in terms of density and size. Venus still has features that are similar to earth maybe in the future venus can be habitable. Us humans should travel from earth and beyond we can not be limited becasue of the dangers there are out in space.

Since Earth and Venus almost have the same density and size i think venus will habitable in a couple of 100's of years just like earth is today. venus is the closest thing we have to Earth. So I think that is why people want to explore Venus. the author even said " Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insights to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors".

Like the author says " Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth". The author also says " long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth" so why cant venus be habitable ever again? It probabaly will but we have to explore it first becasue we dont know what we can encounter oursleves with in the farther future.

Us humans should travel outerspace and look for places where can live if anything ever happenes to earth. We have to think about our future kids, grandsons and theyre children we dont know what the future hold for us and we so we should be prepaired. We cant be limited becasue of how "dangerous" it can be out there. If we are scared we"ll never succeed.
