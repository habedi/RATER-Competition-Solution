How do you use your cell phone the most? To text some or use the calculator? To call someone or check the date? A cell phone definitely comes in handy in some everyday situations, but is it necessary to use it in school when all of the tools that you need are handed to you? These are questions that most students don't really ask themselves. They complain about not being able to use their phone in school, but why do they need to use it? So does a cell phone immediately turn into a distraction as soon as it hits a school campus?

Now, I'm as much of a kid as the next guy, and I use my cell phone probably just as much, but I've never needed it in a school situation unless I was just plain lazy. People say that they wouldn't use their cell phone to text in school, but to use it as a resource. Well, when a student sneaks and uses their cell phone in class, are they using it to solve the question in front of them or telling their friend how bored they are at the moment? My point exactly. Rarely is a cell phone taken out for a helpful use. Also, if cell phones are legalized in the school system, then how often would cell phones get used then? With out the danger and risk in using a cell phone, the students won't find much of a use for them then.

Another argument might be that they need to call/text their mom to inform her of something that's extremely important. Well, if it's something of that nature of emergency, then that's why there is such thing as an office phone. If your sick, ask if you can go to the clinic, then the clinic will diagnose you, then give you the option to call your mom and ask anything that you may need to ask. Why permit cell phones when you have an already functional process at hand? Same goes with if you need something dropped off at the school. You can easily fill out a hall pass, walk whatever short distance it may be to the office, request to use the phone, and 99.9 times out of 99.9, they'll let you use it.
