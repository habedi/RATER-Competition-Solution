Our school principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. Many students are for and against this decision. Cell phones should not be allowed in school. There are many reasons to support my decision. Some reasons are that they are a distraction, can be used for cheating, and can be used to do dangerous or inappropriate things.

First and foremost cell phones are a complete distraction. Using cell phones in school will only make students not pay attention to their teachers. While their teacher is teaching they will be texting and ignoring the lesson. Students will be clue less on class work because they didn't pay attention to the lesson because of their phones. Students will end up failing their classes.

In addition these devices can be used as a source of cheating. While students are taking tests they can easily take out their phones and start texting each other answers. For example, one of my old friends was caught cheating on her test. Since her school allowed phones they thought it would be acceptable to text each other answers. As a result my friend ended up getting a zero on her important test and had to repeat the year. She now also had a record of being a cheater.

Lastly, phones can be used to do inappropriate things. Some students might even use their phones to cyber bully someone. Bullying someone can get you in a load of trouble. It can also cause many problems to the person being bullied. For instance sometimes they might even get mentally or physically hurt. They might even want to put an end to their own life. According to "Time Magazine" 75% of students in the U.S are being bullied to death.

In conclusion cell phones should definitely not be allowed on school grounds. They will just be a huge distraction to everybody. Cell phones can even be used for hurting some one and cheating on tests. These devices would just be unnecessary for school.
