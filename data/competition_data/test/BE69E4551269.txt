Cars, buses, planes, and yes even motorcycles are all ways we use everyday to get from place to place.  You ever thought about how much air pollution and greenhouse gas affects happen each and everday just because we have to get to a destination.? Just like you, I wouldn't have thought that.  But hey, we all got to get around some way, whether it's healthy for our earth or not.

For starters, The world as we know it isn't the most healtiest place ever, for instance, take a look outside.  Is it clean ? You would probably answer no because  mainly because there's pollution, and debris everywhere you lay your eyes on.  Typically you see plastic bags, bottles, containers etc. To some it all up, FLITH.  What I'm trying to say here is that the world already isn't healthy so why continue and do something that is horribly harming the place we live in.  Statistics have shown that there making efforts in the past and future, two decades to make the cities denser, and better for walking. From my prior knowledge, in other cities such as Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.  Driving cars has become so inbeniefical that it's drastically changing the world slowly but surely.  Other places such as the capital of France, Beijing, and China are all well known for their most polluted cities in the world.  Causing many of people's lives to be tragically taken. Something needs to happen fast if we want our world to be a healthy enviornment for us and next generations to come .

Futhermore, Something that I think could really benieft us would have to be Hybrid cars.

Researchers have said that The Honda, and Toyota cars is what everyone needs to get in order to take a further step into positively changing the  Earth.  Mind you the car is low  on gas and is extremely eco friendly.  There's nothing that the climate can do to help us and make this a lot easier. So the  next step would have to be to create something that has many different beniefts to help uplift this world.  Limiting car usage will automatically reduce any air pollution and greenhouse effects.  Another thing that I found interesting would have to be that Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while expectations were made for plug-in cars, ( hybrids ). In my personal opinion, the world be a lot better off with these cars.  Their inexpensive, low pollution waste, and not to mention, they don't rely on gasoline.  There's no way to go wrong with these cars.

All in all, Transportation period is not healthy for the earth.  With tha being said, we need to take cautious as to what we do each and everyday.  I'm not saying don't drive in your cars anymore.  I'm just suggesting the whole world to take a break from all this mayhap and give the earth a rest.  Like in Bogota, Colombia .  Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated,or took buses to work during a car- free day . Just to leave the chaos and the devoid of traffic jams would be awesome. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce green house effect, air pollution,and smog. It's in our best interest to take a stand and change the enviornment.
