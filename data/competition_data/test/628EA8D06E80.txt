In the past I have had so much trouble while taking tests, they are either too hard and I don't understand what is going on or I just can't focus. That is a bad thing because that means if

I am doing bad other kids might be doing bad as well. In class computers should be able to use the Facial Action Coding System to alter things to our knowledge if we get confused on a problem, bored, or distracted.

One way computers can use the FAC System is recognizing when we get confused on a test question. When we get confused instead of asking for help from the teacher the computer can take us through steps to solve the problem and then gives us a new problem so we can do what we just reviewd ourselves. The text also gives us a similar way, in the text it says that the computer can tell when we get confused or bored and modify the test or lesson to make it easier.

Another way the FAC System could be useful is if we get bored during a test or lesson. If we get bored during a trest or lession that computer will recognise that and then taylor the losson so it can be less boring and more fun.

The last way that the FAC system can be useful in schools is if we get distracted. If we get distracted by something while taking a test or doing a lesson of some sort the computer could be able to recognise that and give us some sort of brain break to help give our minds a break to think before getting back into the lesson. This can be helpful in many ways because sometimes if you are distracted by sonmething you are not going to give other work your best effort.

In conclusion in class computers should be able to use the Facial Action Coding System to alter things to our knologer if we get confused on a problem, bored, or distracted
