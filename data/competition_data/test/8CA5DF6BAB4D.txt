Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 is the best choice for our school. it seems like there is a lot of time throughout the day that there is free time. and instead of sitting around in your class doing nothing. why not be on your phone? also at lunch it seems very acceptable to be able to use your phone. lunch is your personal time to eat and socialize with your friends. it should also be aloud that you should use your phone.

Now, kids still use there phones they just have to try to hide it from there teacher. and the teacher has to spend class time taking phones and giving lectures to the person that was caught with the phone. I think that if policy 1 was chosen the amount of kids using there phones in class would greatly decrease. Because if kids knew that they could get on there phones during times like passing period and lunch. then they would not have a reason to have to be on there phones during class time, and in turn, kids would focus better in class.

It wouldn't be taking up class time, if kids could use there phones during there free time. there would be no harm in allowing students to use there cell phones during time that is already meant to be the students personal time. In a workplace, cellphones are not banned. and since school is basically a students workplace. then the same rules and freedoms should apply. Even most teachers check there phones throughout class. i think that if the teacher can have time to take away from teaching there students, because they need to get on there phones. the student should be able to use there phones during time that would not affect anyone else, because it is there personal time.

Most students use there phones to communicate with there parents during school. if there something the parent needs to tell there kid. for example, that they need to ride the bus because the parent wont be able to pick them up. a cell phone would help a lot in a situation like that.

I don't think there is any reason that kids should not be able to use there cellphones during free time. i think that if its free time it should be the kids choice what they want to do with it.

there are also a lot of days throughout the school year. that they are purely fun days. well during those days where we are watching movies just to kill time. i don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to use our phones. rather then watch a animated movie because the teacher had nothing planned.
