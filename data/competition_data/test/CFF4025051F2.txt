Driverless cars should be developed and permited. If more car companies would form and release this idea of driverless cars that would be one less problem people would have to worry about, because everyone would save much more money than they usualy do, and people without cars wouldn't have to worry about getting places. Even though Google has already had cars that could drive by themselves they were not all the way driverless. Human would have to take over when the cars couldn't do what humans can.

The law specificly says that cars are only safe when a human driver is at full control of the vehicle at all times. The law needs to lighten up and approve of driverless cars because it would help everyone all for the better. It will also make us more advanced by discovering new things with better technology. In a few years of so more and more states will have accepted the idea of autonomous cars, laws are going to be changed, and everything will work out just fine.
