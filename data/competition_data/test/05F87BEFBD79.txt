The situation of giving away projects for students to do over summer is a very difficult task because in order to satisfy both ends some things may need to be sacrificed. Teachers should be the ones picking projects over students because how they know what is best for their students. In order to accept the needs and wants of both sides it is best to have the leader of it all to pick what to assign and what not to assign. If the immature students are able to pick what they get to do, their learning over summer will be endangered.

Teachers are best for picking what projects to give to students because they are able to base their decisions based on what the students need most over what they want most. Students picking may not be able to know what is best to develop because they have only been here once; furthermore, teachers are able to know what students need because they have taught for many years and are able to distinguish what is best for the students and what may end up in a lack or even a decline of progress for projects to do over summer.

Students picking what is best for their own projects may end in many ways. The students can make it seem like the work is helping and they are benefiting when they are actually just making it so easy that they can still get away with doing no learning over break if they pick the project. They may also make it based on what they need to work on but just make it super easy to a point where the work they do does not even benefit them. Either one of these is counterproductive and there should be a better option made. It can be seen in the book

The Perfect Storm how when people take on something where they are less experienced that they will fail to reach the goal that the group is hoping for; for example, in

The Perfect Storm the sailors all died because they were not experienced enough to take on a storm that big and were unprepared. a situation like this is just as likely with these less experienced students who may be picking their own projects to do over summer. If this is the case their ships may sink as well and they will not get the learning that they need over summer

The argument can be made that students are actually able to be responsible and that they should be able to pick their own projects. This point is very valid for the responsible students; contrasting this, the assertion can be made that out of every batch of students, there is always a bad egg. The irresponsible students, especially younger and more immature ones, should not be trusted with picking a somewhat annoying project to them, that will get in the way of their free time, time to hang out with friends, and time to play video games. This time is very important to them, especially over summer vacation, and they will do whatever they can to not have to do a lot of work and be able to relax.

In conclusion, the ability for teachers to control the students' projects allows for well planned projects that allow them to continue learning, which would otherwise be negatively affected if the students were the ones deciding. With the large education that those teachers were able to get in order to be there, it can be seen that a project given by them would be far more educational and productive than one made by the students. In order to make a good project to give, it takes experience and maturity, without these it would be like there is nothing useful being done for these students over summer.
