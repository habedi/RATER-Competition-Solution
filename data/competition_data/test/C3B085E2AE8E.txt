Students shouldn't need at least a grade B average just to participate in sports or activities. What if they have like a grade C or D average? They should still be able to participate in sports. Just because they have low grades doesn't mean they don't want to be able to participate in sports or activities. What if they're actually really trying to get good grades but they aren't getting the good grades that they want?

They should still be able to participate so they can have fun and participate in sports with they're friends. They should be able to join if they want too join. So again, students should be able to join in sports and activities if they want too. What if they are good at that sport or activity and you're losing out a good player or student who also just wants to have fun and be with their friends'? Students shouldn't have to get very good grades just to participate in a sport or activity.

You should at least put up a flyer and see who wants to sign up for the program and if there are to many students who want to sign up, then choose students who have the better grades. If the students you chose who have the better grades aren't athletic or energetic then choose an athletic and energetic student who wants to actually try and be good at something. You should at least try and be fair to other students who want to actually play something or do something that's energetic and fun. You shouldn't choose someone just because they have good grades, choose someone because they're good at something or want to be good at something.
