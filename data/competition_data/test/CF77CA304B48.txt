I personally think that students should be assigned summer projects so they don't get lazy and they are able to get back in the school environment prepared. If students do get assigned a summer project I think it should be teacher-designed so students can get more out of it. During this essay I will briefly explain all my ideas and why I think students should be assigned some summer projects. Hopefully after reading this I hope you take my personal opinion into account.

First, students need to be assigned work so they arent turned into lazy slobs after summer ends. That doesn't mean they can't rest, but that also means they can't do nothing for their entire summer break. If students are assigned summer project it can remind them how hard working they were in the past and it will make them continue to work hard! For example, when I was younger I never had anything assigned to me so when I got back into school I didn't have the right mindset and I was never able to work hard; Now however, I am being assigned summer projects and although it's a pain for me to do them I still appreciate that summer projects keep me focused.

Next, Students should be assigned a summer project so they can get back into the learning world easily.

If students go into summer with no assigned projects then they'll forget a lot of things they've learned in the past. my sister, who's finished with school, told me that school was way easier because she was always assigned work during the summer and it helped her remember what shes learned. currently at this time and age I feel as if students don't take things like this into account and always question why they can't remember past material, but it's because they don't have and summer projects that would help them in their next years classes.

if we're being assigned a summer project then I would want it to be teacher-designed because your teachers will know what's best for you so they can assign things based on your weaknesses and things that can help you in your future. Say you were student that was struggling in science in the past. Teachers can use that knowledge and can assign you a project that can teach you what you weren't able to learn before. If teachers give you project based on what your weaknesses are then it is a major game changer for your future.

I understand that some students disagree in the fact that some schools should have summer projects because they might be busy during the summer because they might have work and a lot of things going on at home, but students still need to be assigned summer projects so they won't always be lost once they come back to school. If the student does the project and comes back to school prepared then they will end up thanking the teachers for assigning them the project. I was assigned a math project during the summer for geometry and it really ended up helping me because I usually struggle in that subject but not anymore!

In conclusion, I personally think that students should be assigned summer projects so they don't get lazy and they are able to get back in the school environment prepared. if you still disagree on students needing to do summer projects then write a response on why you disagree. Once you finish your response on why you disagree then I would recommend you present it to your teachers and see what they think!
