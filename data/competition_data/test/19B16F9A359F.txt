Hello welcome, come join the merry crew of the Seagoing Cowboys. Yes, we got every thing you need from fun adventures, get to help people, and to friendly crew mates. So, come join us for some fun!

Fun adventures are what you need. "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy," says Luke a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke toured an excaved castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins To help these countries revcover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabiliation Administration). That's when we stepped into the fight to help others survive.

The crew also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded By playing games and having little tournaments with one another. So if your playful but responsable , you'll fit right in.

So by helping others please join the Seagoing Cowboys. With all it's good resons you will find a spot thats good for you. Help make a difference in the world of war and conflict. Join the helpful hand of Seagoing Cowboys and the U.N.R.R.A. (the United Nations Relief and Rehabiliation Administration).
