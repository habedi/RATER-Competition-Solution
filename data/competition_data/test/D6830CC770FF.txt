Dear Principal,

I think you should not let us use our Cell Phones during our free time out side, in between classes, and lunch. the kids these days are to obsessed with there phones these days. If you let them use there Phones in there free time, kids these days don't do work or anything so there free time is gonna be every time of the day. You will never be getting them off there phones and you will never be getting them to do there work. i can say this for the parents kids never get off there phones now days. My brother when he has a girlfriend he never puts the phone down. When he does put it down its because he is doing something really important. Even when he doesn't have a girlfriend he never puts the phone down. i use my phone too but have the time i loose it or its not charged and i don't charge it until next week. and that's true too. If you let these kids use there Cell Phones in school you are making a big mistake by doing so. Its not gonna mater anyways students already use there phone in school anyways. I know people that text in class every time i see them they are texting. Now if you let us use our ipods and MP3 players in class and in between class and free time then that would be a different story. You cant text or call people from those. I use my ipod all the time. i have 236 songs i listen to and games on it too, but the cell phones are a bad idea.

Your student,
