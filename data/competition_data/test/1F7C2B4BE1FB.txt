This technolgy of you can calculate the emotions of people just by pretty much just scanning your face is pretty cool. I believe that this is cool to have in classrooms and how teachers can teach us how to use this.

The reason why I do want this technology is classrooms is because teachers now can understand what is going through our heads when they are teaching a lesson. They can understand if we aren't getting the information that they are teaching into our heads. They can use this in the furture to better understand how to teach and how to make lessons better. This technology can change the world. This could also help in a school way by artwork like the Mona Lisa. With this technology we can now see her emotion, and with other paintings or artwork just like this. We can now connect to the artist who made it. People all over the world can now understand the artwork.

Another reason why I think we should use emotional expressions is because in the past we really can't know what a person is feeling. You can try and hide it or you can put on a fake smile and everyone believes it. We can use the emotional expressions to prevent sucide. 8th grade to 12th grade, everything is changing your friends, your family, your school, and your teachers. When growing up into a adult life can be very rough. This could help because now we ca see how needs to and how we can help them. In this acticle it says " classifed six basic emotions. Happiness, surpise, anger, digust, fear and even sadness." We can get emotions out of that are to scare to come through but are wanting help but dont understand how to. Doctors, and scientists are study even beyond how this works.

In this essay I talked about how an technology such as the emotional expressions can read off emotions. Teachings, changing the way how this could save people's life, and last six basic emotions. The world would change.
