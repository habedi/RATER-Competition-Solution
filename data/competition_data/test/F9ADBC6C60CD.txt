Dear TEACHER_NAME,

What is the reason why you want to change the grade average to C to B to participate in sports? Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I am a eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing you this letter because I want to give my opinion about letting the average of students grades to be a B in order to play sports. In this letter I am going to how changing the average of students grades to B, it will keep kids more educated, it will help the school be a smarter school, and will give kids a punishment if they don't have an average of a B.

Students will be more educated by having more time to do homework then play ball. Lots of kids who play sports take more of their time practicing then doing school work. For example I play soccer at SCHOOL_NAME it takes a lot of time out of my day but I still enjoy it. I have straight A' s too. Student that don't make the team will have more time to study for a test or do homework. They may even make better grades then the people that are in sports which is great.

SCHOOL_NAME will be a smarter school by changing the grade policy to a B average. Instead of the kids making bad grades that are in sports they can be making good grades out of sports. we will have more smart kids in our school instead of good athletic teams. i know that these is a big change in our school but I think we can do it.

Students will also have a punishment for people that are it sports with a low average of their grades. Kids that make bad grades that are on the school teams. kids will be scoring higher so they can get on the school sports team.

In conclusion, by changing the grade average to B to be in sports kids will, be more educated, we will be a smarter school, and kids will have punishment if they don't have B average. Thank you for listening to my concerns.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
