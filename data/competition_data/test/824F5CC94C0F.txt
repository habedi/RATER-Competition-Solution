Dear, TEACHER_NAME i think students should not be required to perform community service. The reason why it think that is because students should not be doing things like that they shouldn't be cleaning up the streets. They have better things to do like read a book do home work learn go out and play family time and many more .Kids should not work at such early age especially cleaning streets .I think you should give that job to older people because there are many parents with out a job and with out a job the cant pay there bills live in a house and feed there kids which could be any of your students .Think about it what if u did not have money to put a roof over u family or even to feed your family and then your kids principal is making him or her to clean up the streets that's like giving a kid a job and not paying them i don't know about you but i don't think its fair to give students community service .So do me a favor think about this and let me know what u think because i would like to hear what u have to say about this.
