The challange of exploring venus. Exploring venus would be hard but not easy because of there weather conditions. Venus does have alot of things on there plant that Earth has also. Venus is sometimes the Evening Star due to the fact that it is the brightest light in the sky also making it simple for amateur stargazer to spot. Now scientist say that it may be possible to live on Venus some day but they are having a hard time trying to study Venus because of a thick atomosphere that almost has 97 percent carbon dioxide.

Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in terms of density and size. One of the National Aeronautics an Space Administration are trying to send humans to study Venus. They are trying figure out a solution where the humans they send can be in a floating vehicle or some kind of way they can study Venus without Being on the plant. If they were to be on the plant they would be burning up because of how hot Venus is the degrees are around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

Nasa will be looking to figure new ways on how to study Venus. They are working on making a some kind of object to go on Venus to see what information they can get. WHo knows Nasa someday in the future will figyre out more about Venus.
