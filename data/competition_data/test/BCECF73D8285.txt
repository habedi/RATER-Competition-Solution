Should we keep the Electoral college, or take it away for popularity vote? Well, the Electoral College is a process which they cannot hold office, but can help the presidents votes. A popularity vote is which we the citizens of the United States vote on who we would like the president to be. The Electoral Collge helps vote for the president of the United States because there is a certainty of the outcome, and the Electoral College are like presidents too. I support the idea of which keeping the Electoral College for the help in the presidential run.

Keeping the Electoral College is vital to the presidents because there is a certainty of the outcome. Richard A. Posner states: "The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote." This means that the Electoral College votes count more than the popularity votes for the upcoming president. For example, Richard A. Posner states that "Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney..." This means that the Electoral College votes are way more acounted for then the popular votes.

Aren't Electoral Colleges like presidents too? They help the presidents votes and help them make decisions also. Doesn't that sound like a president to you? The article states "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal." says Richard A. Posner. This means that Electoral Colleges no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The president electes Electoral Colleges to be in there favor.

There is a high chance that Electoral College's help presidents in many ways. Such as, the Electoral Colleges are like presidents too, and there is a certainty of the outcome. Lets face it the soon to be presidents need the Electoral Colleges.
