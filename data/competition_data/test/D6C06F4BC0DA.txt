Dear principal,

Have you ever had to clean up other peoples trash off the side of the street, clean up dog poop from someone else's lawn, or had to walk across the beach and pick up cans, paper, bottles, and any other garbage that has been left at the beach. If you have good for you but not all people need or want to help the community. I think that we should leave community service up to the volunteers and people who got sent to community service by law. Instead of having everybody do it at the school. You could have everybody that gets in trouble do it as a punishment. Why would you have everybody do it when you could have people that want to do it do it so there is no complaining. I think that if there is complaining there will be fighting and that will just cause trouble. Not everyone wants to do community service so only have the people that want to do it help the community or else everyone else is going to complain and not follow the rules so there would be more people getting in trouble. When more people get in trouble the schools rating will go down and less people will go to that school so do you really want that? I'm guessing not especially if your the principal. So only have the people that want to do it do it so there are less fights and the school rating doesn't go down.

sincerely
