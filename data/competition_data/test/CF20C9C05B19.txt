There are many different emotions that you go through on a daily basis. Some of them are pleasing motions and others aren't. Every emotion that you go through can be seen by other people through your facial queues. Facial queues are important in some instances, but they are not important for education.

The Facial Action Coding System would have a lot of uses on a set for a tv program or play. It could help make a set run more efficiently by automating ligh queues and what not. The opposite of that is true for schools. There is not a real good reason for schools to use funding to buy FACS because not every computer in the school needs one. It might be useful to have one on every external door to the school to aid with security but not on school computers. In paragraph 5 of the excerpt it states, "In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day." That sentence is explaining that humans already do what the FACS does, Furthermore we don't need a computer to read our emotions because we already do so.

Facial queues are important to everyday life. It is how humans read and help understand eachother. A FACS can be useful to help further security in schools, but not as useful to help students learn.
