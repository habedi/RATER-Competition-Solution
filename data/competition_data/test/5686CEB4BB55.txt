Let's say you are at school. You have always wanted to learn astronomy out of school, but it was always to expensive. Then you friend comes up and asks you to join his extracurricular activity for astronomy. You decide to do it and are happy with your decision.

Extracurricular activities are fun for schools, and if your principal made a rule, that you would have to do an extracurricular activity, it would benefit lots of people. I think that student should participate in at lease one extracurricular activity.

One reason I think this is because students would get more experience of what you like to do. According to John Walter, a genius who has been studying kid behavior for years, says that, "If students had to do an extracurricular activity, they would get more experience and it would show their boundaries of what they like, and what they dont." This means that it would tell students what they do and do like. It also tells us that the more students that try extracurricular activities, the more they will know to. Because they will shown what they might like that they didnt know they liked. In fact, Experience of a Lifetime, a news article that tells us what we should and shouldnt try, stated that, "The more experiences you get, the more you experience you have with what you can and can't do." This means that the more experiences you have, the more you know your capabilities. For example, lets say that you joined a basketball and a soccer extracurricular activity. You excelled at the soccer, but were super bad at basketball. So then you would know that soccer is in your capabilities while basketball isnt.

Another reason why we should be forced to do extracurricular activities is that we would meet more people. In fact, Friends in the End, a magazine about mental health's relations effects on more friends, says that, "In extracurricular activity you can make more friends, and when you socialize with them, it makes your mental health better." This means that the more friends you have, the better your mental health will be. If your mental health is better, then it can lead to happier life with lots of people that you like. Extracurricular activities also make you meet people with the same interests. In a study from The Friends Foundation, an organization that studies kids behavior with other kids, "Extracurricular activity engorge people with the same interests as you to get together, and make some friends." This means that the more people you meet with the same interest, the more likely you will become friends with them.

And you also get to learn who you are in this world. Wally Thompson, an author of 8 books on finding yourself, says that, "The more experience you have in this world, the more you learn what you like and grow from it." This means that the more you know about yourself, the more you grow as a person. It relates back to extracurricular activity by telling you that you could make more friends if you know the kind of people you like to be around. Speaking of making friends, The Friends Foundation also stated that, "The more time you spend with your friends, the more that they know you, and you could ask them how they see you as a person." This means that your the more time you spend with your friends, the more they know you as a person. Your friends know you the best because they are the people you are with the most, and you would spend even more time with them if extracurricular activities were required.

On the other hand, extracurricular activities can be bad because they take up quiet some time. A study from the University of Illinois states that, "It takes about 2 hours out of your time, and can even be a strain to do if you dont like you extracurricular activity." And this is true, but what if you did choose an extracurricular activity you liked? William Smith, an expert on kids enjoyment, states that, "Time flies when your having fun, it doubles for kids," This means that if you like the extracurricular activities you do, then they will go by fast. Speaking of fast, Robert Dunkin, who works for the Help Kids Learn program, states that, "Kids will do a lot of things to do what they like to do and we use that as a reward. After school though, like extracurricular activities." This means that kids love what extracurricular activities have to offer, and they see it as a reward. Most kids would love this because they get to do what they love, or try new things.

I think that extracurricular activities should be required and that students must do at least one because you get more experience, meet more people, and learn who you are. So what? You should remember, the students are the next generation, they will lead the future on. You could help by trying to get extracurricular activities at your school, or support, even host one. As time goes on we will grow up and eventually become the parents and teachers. We, the students are the future, do you want us to remember school for just school or something more than that?
