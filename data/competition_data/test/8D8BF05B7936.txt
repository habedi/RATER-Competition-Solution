The break between school years is a time for students to prepare themselves for the year to come. It can be inferred that children tend to put school in the back of their mind during this period. This is understandable but middle and high school students continue to learn: this is with the help of various projects and work given to students to work on during their break. The summer reading projects that are given to most grades keep the mind in a working state allowing for the transition between school years to be easier for students and teachers. Student-designed projects are more favorable to teacher-designed projects because it allows for the student to be creative as well as coming across as mature and responsible.

Creativity is a characteristic, which is more often then now, seen to be taught and picked up on at young ages. Of course, there is high school art classes or projects in general given to children during the year to get their creative minds working. Most of the time though, the projects given are somewhat limited in how they can appear or the topic of what the project is based on because they are most likely teacher designed. As a matter of fact, certain school classes have more projects than others, but there is not a lot of student-designed work. As for summer reading projects, the Ã¡Âºâo-dÃÂ¶ list is often restricted to a handful of books then the students have to look a little past the words to get a deeper meaning behind the lines for a finished project. Giving school attendees a project that gives them full control over the design, the final product, and how the project is presented can really boost the studentÃâº summer. The creativity that would be provided can really improve a studentÃâº summer as a whole.

Maturity and responsibility come with age. This is often tested a lot during apersonÃâº life, and it can be tested during school as well to see how far a child is progressing. Summer projects are given to keep the children working during the summer. There are many reasons why this is true, but some students do not want to think during summer. Giving this type of student a teacher-designed project can allow them to breeze past the summer project. Therefore, not benefiting them in any way, shape or form. Giving out a student-designed project needs more brain power to actually become a finished product. The responsibility given to students with a project ran by them can separate the more mature children of the bunch and the lesser half. Being able to finish a school project during the summer takes dedication, but involves a lot more accountability and maturity to complete a project created, thought out, and produced by them.

The creativity and responsibility needed to finish a project designed by the student given the project, by far, surpasses the benefits of a teacher-designed summer project. Both of these projects are given over the summer to keep students learning during summer break, but teacher-designed projects are often favored. This is because the work given usually pertains to the curriculum to get the studentÃâº prepared for the year to come. However, it is much superior to give a student the opportunity to show how mature they can be, how responsible they are, and also show how well their mind works by itself: creativity. It is clear which choice is better for the student to keep their mind up: having them design their own project, but it will only take time to see when student-designed summer projects will be implemented into various school systems around the globe.
