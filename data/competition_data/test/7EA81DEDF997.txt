Some schools offer online or distance learning as a way of still taking classes outside the classroom or at home. Because not every student has the same circumstances, the traditional classroom may not be the best fit for every student. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because not everyone learns in the same way, and it can be the right path for some people based on their circumstances.

One way online learning benefits students is it allows them to attend classes around their own schedule. Some students may be exceptionally talented at a sport or musical instrument, and they can spend more time practicing while attending online classes that fit their schedule. If a student plans on pursuing a talent based career, then going to school seven hours per day will likely not prepare them for that specific career. For example, it is more important for a professional swimmer to spend time practicing swimming than time taking classes. This can also be applied to prospective professional swimmers. With distance learning, talented students would be able to continue practicing their talent while also continuing their education. Online school would be incredibly beneficial for those with who choose to take different paths while still pursuing their education.

Students spend around thirteen years of the first few years of their lives in classrooms. While education is very important, sometimes the most effective way of learning isn't the traditional classroom. Cultural and language immersion in different countries is another way to learn. Immersion is without a doubt the quickest way to learn a language and about other cultures around the world. Worldly and cultural experiences are valuable ways to learn, and may be the right option for some people.

While traveling the world, students can still keep up with their studies through distance learning. These experiences are very valuable and do not come from the traditional classroom.

People with nontraditional familial circumstances can also benefit from distance learning. For example, if a student has a child, parent, grandparent, or sibling that they need to take care of, they can attend online classes while still caring for their family. Another example may be if a student needs to work to help support their family or child. If a family member gets sick and needs extra money or assistance, students can take online classes and work to support this family member. Education and family life are very important, and distance learning can assist students to balance each of these parts of their lives. Even if this is a temporary condition, online school can help people adapt to unexpected circumstances while remaining in school.

Finally, distance learning can benefit students who have unique learning styles and can allow them to take classes at their own pace. Attending online classes can be more personalized in the way that students can go as fast or slow as they want. They could attend four online classes in a day, or take one and have the opportunity to make sure they understand all of the content. Some people may also be more comfortable alone while learning, and want to figure problems out on their own.

The traditional classroom is not always right for everyone. Whether it be because of the choice to travel or hone a skill, the need to take care of a family member, or personal learning style, distance learning offers a more flexible approach for any student's circumstances. It is important to be sensitive and open to other people's priorities and conditions, and the option to attend online classes offers this flexibility in freedom, while allowing students to continue their education.
