Convenience has become a leading factor in the way we make decisions. We have begun doing everything via the internet. Whether that be shopping, conversations etc. Though school remains an inconvenience in present day. Many times students struggle to wake up in the morning to attend school. Others have unreliable transportation to school. I believe that students should be offered online curriculum as it would allow for better engagement, improved attendance, and more innovative lessons.

Students learn in different ways. Some find listening to a teacher lecture beneficial, while others require a more hands on approach in order for them to learn effectively. Schools often present different learning avenues for the benefit of their students. Why not offer them an online curriculum? Many students are very comfortable using their electronics. This has contributed to a lack of engagement in static learning. Many students state, "I can't sit anymore". Online learning would allow students to have flexibility in their work schedule. If they needed to take a break they could simply pause the lesson for a few minutes. This argument has been met by critics who say, "That's the way school is". I strongly disagree with this statement. Students now benefit less from static activities than those of previous generations. Studies have shown that the attention span of the average human has decreased drastically in the past 20 years. Schools should look at this and alter their curriculum. Some students are not able to listen effectively while sitting down for hours. Online learning would alter this and allow for a more flexible learning structure. I believe that schools should adapt to the changing learning environment and mold their curriculum to appeal to the "modern" student.

Another benefit of online education would be its accessibility and ease. Many students miss school regularly, whether it be due to inconsistent bus arrivals or the lack of personal transportation. This contributes to a lack of education due to missed days. The implementation of online learning would do away with this. Without the necessity for students to travel to class early in the morning, student attendance would excel. This also reduces the amount of pressure placed on students in the morning. Many students stress about missing the bus or having to "rush" to get ready for school. This can be taxing on the student before the school day has begun. Subsequently, this leads to a lack of engagement in school as they are already tired from the morning's events. With online learning, even though still required to participate, students would not be presented with the possibility of missing school due to a transportation mishap.

The internet also provides schools with resources that were never imaginable. Prior to the popularization of technology, learning was not very innovative. Often times students would not get to see different aspects of the things they were learning about. With the use of technology in schools a new level of engagement can be found. Students will be able to visualize the things they are learning about in one click. Many schools do not have adequate funding to take students on field trips to see the things in their curriculum. Though with online learning, access to any aspect of education would be available. Geography teachers could show students historic sites, science teachers could show students chemical reactions, etc. Many critics state that "the use of technology has no place in education, its a distraction". I disagree with is statement. Online learning can be a great resource. It can provide a greater understanding of concepts and can significantly increase a students learning capabilities if used effectively.

Online learning is a very beneficial option for students. Some find the current school day to be boring or uninteresting. Why not give these students a way to enhance their learning experience. With the implementation of online learning attendance would improve, engagement would increase, and lesson plans would become more innovative. These aspects would improve the education and learning experience of the "modern" student.
