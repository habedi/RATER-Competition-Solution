A lot of people argue that in school, the teachers know best and not the students. This has led many people to believe that summer school projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed. Summer school projects should be student-designed because teaching methods evolve with each generation and it gives the student more confidence.

An efficient teaching system would change the way it teaches in response to newer and smarter generations. For example, when computers were becoming common in the 80's and 90's, many schools adapted to using them to better teach their students. This made teaching much faster for both the teachers and the students. Because the students back then demanded change, almost every school in America now has computers in it.

Students would be much more confident if they knew the assignment was designed by another student. One example is the SOL's tests in the state of Virginia. Many students would find it more convenient if the questions on the test were more modern or relatable and made by someone closer to their age. Applying this to every test would significantly boost student performance. Also, there is a popular saying that goes, "Great minds think alike." Students minds are more sharp than most teachers minds, therefore resulting in a more efficient assignment design system. Furthermore, this leaves the students with less stress, easing the massive load of pressure that modern schools apply on them.

From a constant wave of smarter, brighter generations of students to just simple confidence; this is why summer school assignments should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. If we stick with old methods, no one will succeed into the future.
