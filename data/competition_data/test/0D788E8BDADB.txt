To the Principal

I think requiring athletes to have a B average just to play soccer is ridiculous. This policy is ridiculous because it is hard enough trying to get a B average when not playing a sport, but when your playing one or two sports that is hard. You have to remember athletes have to go hour long practices and some days they to go a game hours away play an hour or two and then by the time they get home it is almost mid night and they still have to sixty math problems for homework, and while trying to that they fall asleep and then the next morning get yelled at for not having their homework.

The athletes that play school sports have to go to practice right after school. By the time they get done with practice they go home eat dinner take a shower and then do their homework ,but they rush trough it because the y want to hang out with their friends. The next morning when turn in their homework they get a D on it because they rushed and did not follow directions.

Trying to home work after away games is though because games are hours away. the team leaves at 4:00 and gets to field at 7:00 they play at 8:00 and leave by 9:00 then they get home at 12:00 take a shower and usually fall asleep. The next day your lucky if even half of that team shows up for school the next day.

That is why athletes should not have to have a B average to play sports. They have to worry about practices. They games hours away from home. Lets face it you have to give kids time to be kids and do stuff they want to do, and not make them worry about their grades so they can play their favorite for their school it is just not right sports are suppose to be fun. Making have a B average to play sports may even cut down on the amount of players that try out for a team.
