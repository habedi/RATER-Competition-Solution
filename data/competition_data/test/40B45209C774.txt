Are you a student in school, what would you think if your principal said you must partake in a extracurricular? I think it's wrong here are my reasons why, students might not like being social, you dont know there income, the guardian might not let them do a activity.

I know as a student that it is stressful to get good grades will having a social life too. Many kids have anxiety which effects there social skills and there friendships. Although some kid just dont like being social or working along side someone they dont know. Most extracurricular involve social skills like, talking to a teammate. helping someone with a project, or just playing a game like football or soccer. Whats to say that someone dont have server anxiety where they cant be around other people.

Sports are extracurricular that u need money to be apart of but what happens when i student dont have the money to join the team. Many other clubs make u pay a fee to join. If you do a project in a club you may need money to bye the supplies for said project. Gasoline also coast's a lot today and u need that to get to the extracurricular. What happens when your parents cant bring u to the meeting or the games that affects the way u partake in the group setting.

Parents are over protective of there kids, some parents wont let there kid join because of there protectiveness. And sports are very dangers if not played properly. there parent also might want them to stay at home so they can do family activities together. and what if i child has a Illness and cant do extracurricular became of there illness or disability.

parents can also be really attached to their kid so much they dont want then to go to school.

to sum this up I think it's wrong here are my reasons why, students might not like being social, you dont know there income, the guardian might not let them do a activity. how do you feel about this topic?
