Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard that you were changing the Cell phone policy at school and that you haven't picked witch new policy yet. In my opinion i don't think that cell phones should be allowed at school because they can get stolen and are a distraction.

My first example is how a cell phone can get stolen. Most kids bring there cell phones to school and take them around with them, like my friend RELATIVE_NAME. RELATIVE_NAME did not have a P.E. locker last year; So she shared one with her friend. One day she had put her phone and ipod into the locker and left it there over the weekend. Sadly her friend had forgotten to put the lock back onto her locker. The next Monday RELATIVE_NAME came back to get her Phone and ipod. Both had been stolen. RELATIVE_NAME was devastated, Also like most teenagers she was obsessed with her cell phone. Her parents weren't very happy Also.

There was another girl that i knew when i was in sixth grade. At my other school we did not get lockers at all, We all had to carry around back packs.

One day her phone drooped out of her pocket in P.E. and she had no clew where it had gone. All her friends helped her search for it for days. Luckily for her a student found it and turned it in.

My Next Example of why we should not be able to have cell phones at school is because they are a distraction. Last year There was a class that i was in where the teacher let the kids text or listen to music while they worked. The only bad part was that none of the kids worked. And the kids like me who were trying to work kept getting distracted by all the talking, clicking, and the blasting rap music coming from there phones. It gave me a headache. I couldn't stand how much noise was going on and so i did not get much work done and i almost failed the class. One of the student in my class also got enjoyed and told the guidance councilor what was happing. The rest of the year i was able to work in peace because the assistant principal kept coming in to make shore that there was no moor craziness.

To sum it all up, i think that cell phones should not be allowed at school because they are very distracting and can get stolen at school.
