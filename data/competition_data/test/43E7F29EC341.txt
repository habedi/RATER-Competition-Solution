In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D'Alto we can see different studies such as the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinios and experts like Prof. Thomas Huan and Dr. Paul Eckman are saying that a computer software "Facial Action Coding System" can recognize emotions, the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face with all the 44 major muscles they had classified 6 basic emotions which are happiness,surprise, anger,disgust fear and sadness.

"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"

Dr. Huang observes, In my opinion computers should not learn or know how to read your emotions even thought it could help in a classroom by recognizing when a student is becoming confused or bored, i don't think every single human expressions of each emotions are the same, in the introduction of this article we can read that the "New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other" but how accurate can it be? for example when your not making any face expressions or when you're not feeling any of those 6 expressions listed what is the computer going to say, In paragraph 7 and 8 we can see how the computers "can indicate the difference between a genuine smiled and a forced one" this is possible by using the Zygomaric major muscles but what about when you're making a forced sad face can the computer recognize that too?

because it doesn't really clarify in the article. Other reason why i think computers should not be able to read or recognized your emotions is because even if it does help teachers and advertisers see what the other people is feeling i don't think it would be very usefull.

In conclusion the software Facial Action System should not know how to recognized what you're feeling beacuse is not very usefull and it doesn't say how accurate it is also not every single human express their feelings, emotions or face expressions the same futhermore i think it is usefull for some people but not everyone would like a computer to tell them what they feeling.
