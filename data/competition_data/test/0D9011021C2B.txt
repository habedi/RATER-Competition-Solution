Do you want to be forced to work on something? No one does and if a school makes you do an extracurricular activity thats whats going to happen. If we have activities in school, then the after school activity would have to be after school. There is a reason why we have P.E, FACS, coding, and stuff like that. We have those classes so that we dont have to do after school activity.

The first reason why students shouldnt have to do extracurricular activities is because they could already be doing and activity. Whether its Babysitting siblings, playing with toys at home, playing video games, doing sports, or even doing a cooking class. Those are good activities, and even better, its an activity that they like. what if the student doesnt like any of the activity choices given to them. That could be bad for the child. Its like making a person eat when their full already, And to add onto this, The child could also be going somewhere already like out to eat, going to their moms house, dads house, friends house or a restaurant

Another reason schools shouldnt make kids do extracurricular activities is because after a long day of school or work you want to just chill and sit down, listen to relaxing music, drink soda, eat food, and all that good stuff. What if your school took away that time from you? That wouldnt be that great because then you have no down time. another thing you could do in this free time is study, do homework, and even work on some other stuff. this time could give student more time to complete and understand their homework. This would make the student more focus and responsive during class.

The last reason I have for disagreeing with making kids participate in extracurricular activities is because the kids pick up time would change. some parents that go to work everyday get sleepy. they want to sleep after work just like the child does after school. parents get sleepy fast and thats because they have a lot to deal with. If schools dont do this, than the after school stuff wont be a problem. another reason is because the parent could be working afternoon hours the day that the child has to be picked up. Then the parent is going to freak out and try to get someone to get the child for you. the next reason is because the parent dose not have enough time to pick up the chi;d. and the last reason is because maybe you dont have the money to drive miles to you son or daughters school.

In Conclusion, if schools dont make kids do extracurricular activities, then none of this will happen. So I say we should save the troubles and just not do it. Treat people how you want to be treated. I think this is mean to the children because I feel like the children should have a say in what they want to do.
