I think that technology is valuable in a classroom because, it is an easier way to learn new stuff. Another way it is valuable is that technology is the most popular advertisment out. Everybody needs one, even if u are a kid. Plus all of the teachers can easly grade your homework right from their computer. They can access anything they need to help students out. We can look up anything on the computer. The main thing about technology is anybody can access anything or anything they want. But Idont think that it will be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. The reason I think that is because you cant be able to do it. If we could do that then the teachers would know how to control, listen, and be able to instuct whatever they are learning about. But all that i can say is that we need to understand how we can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.
