As a NASA scientist, I believe that the " face " on Mars is a natural formation. I dont believe that aliens could have formed this. During my work, I have discovered many different ways to make you believe that the face is natural.

The scientists that work with NASA, such as myself, have found many different reasons as to why the formation looks like a face. During our time photographing Mars, we have been equiped with much better quality cameras, which help us see things better on Mars itself. Over the years, we have discovered that when you use a higher quality Mars Global surveyer (MGS), the " face " no longer looks like a face. Still some people didn't believe us the first time we got photographs of the land mark, so went and did it again. This time, we made sure that there weren't any clouds that could default the photos of Mars. What we found out by looking at these photos is the the facial features are simply just shadows. Take the eyes for example, while photographed from the middle of the land mark, there is a shadow being created by the sun. From this angle, the sun makes the land mark seem as if it had eyes. The " mouth " is simply just a hole in the land mark, which looks like a mouth while photographed from the middle of the land mark. There is no way aliens could be the cause of a natural piece of land on Mars.

Now that you understand what the " Face " actually is, I hope you dont still think aliens were the cause of it. There is scientific proof that it is a natural piece of land that just so happened to form on Mars.
