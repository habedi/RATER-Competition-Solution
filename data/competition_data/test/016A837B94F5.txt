The use of the Facial Action Coding technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could help out the student on how they are feeling, and want them to continue the lesson. This technology could read your emotions by just looking at your face. With this technology we could tell how some of the students are feeling. Some students could get confused or bored with the lesson and this could change that.

In the text it states that the a classroom computer could recognize if the student is becoming confued or bored, then the software would modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. While the software changes the lesson it could change the student's emotion and make them want to continue learning. It could make the lesson more interesting to learn and would help out students with better grades and test scores.

The Facial Action Coding System could also benefit the teachers because they do a lot of work like preparing the lesson and grading things, so the lesson they create could be uninteresting or confusing. With the software the lesson could be more clear and interesting for the students to learn and the teacher wouldn't be so stressed with so much work. The text also states, humans could calculate how people are feeling just by looking at their facial expression, but some people hide their emotions. The software could get how students are feeling even better and someone like the teacher could help out their problems.

This is why The Facial Action Coding System should be used in the classroom because it could help both students and the teacher. It is an innovative technology that could help us in many ways.
