Students may be assigned projects from their instructors over summer break. This task can be rather frustrating, time consuming, and confusing when made by a teacher. Students have different lives with different perspectives from one another and their teacher. Students may even have a better understanding when a fellow student-peer explains rather than a teacher. Summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed.

If students were to design a summer project, they'd think of the best way to relate to others and compromise to obtain the best connection with others. Students know that others think differently and go to various locations over break, however; it wouldn't exclude them from the assignment, but rather work toward their schedule as planned and give them a topic for a project. This would mean students don't have to consume lots of time researching, won't have trouble completing the assignment, and have fun on break with this student made project that reflects back on, "Your Summer Vacation", for example.

Each students see things different from each other and teachers as well. Teachers can be one sided and assign things based off what they think is best for their students, furthermore; this may not be true because students don't think or see like teachers. Students have a huge variety of different perspective on things. So, a project created by students would fit better because of all the ideas sparked up would come together and be at everyone's benefit and not just one specific person. Teachers tend to confuse students with the way they word things at times, where as students have a better understanding of one another and all there different ideas they brainstorm as well. Also, students may have more in common rather than with their teachers because they're more likely influenced by the same stuff that's around their age group like things such as: music, television, social media, and/ or video games.

Many different times there has been students who fail to complete projects assigned by their instructors because of how overwhelming the directions were or how hard it was to process. Students will want the best understanding for each other because we know what's difficult and what is moderate work. Teachers sometimes expect students to do things they can't do on a project; if a student were to design a project, it would get straight to the point and tell you exactly what you need to do in order to complete the task correctly and not wrong while being away from school during the summer. Students also understand that they may even would want to work in a group, especially if there away for break so they can help each other out possibly, but teachers only allow it to to be one person where it may be more challenging without the help of them being at school. Students on break don't want to have to spend their time working on stuff for school, that's why if students made a project, it would educate but not interfere with their freedom,so everybody wins, both teachers and students.

Overall, students don't look toward to doing summer projects, they'd rather go places and have fun with friends and family. However; the task might as well be a fun, student-organized project that is planned to help gain knowledge during break. The results of this would be that students are still learning while they enjoy themselves and not stressing over not being able to understanding what there doing. With the addition of the help from their parents too, students would put in a format where anyone who reads the instructions, knows exactly what to do. Student-designed projects would be the best way for students to learn over summer.
