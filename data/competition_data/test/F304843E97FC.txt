Imagine being able to detect how other people are feeling. even when they are trying to hide their emotion. New software has been developedthat improves accuracyi in perceving the emotions of others. This new sofeware, the facial action coding system, has promising applications for a variety of industries.

I think this technology is cool but i also feel like its a waste of money and time and i feel like its not important. I also think that using this machine on students is wrong. They need to give the students their own privacy. This machine doesnt really serve a purpose other than reacing facial expressions and emothions, you canj do that without the use of the machine thats why i think its pointless. i feel as though this is more of a game or toy then a useful technology.

As you can see, i do not favor the technology and i dont its vailid or useful at all for many different reasons.
