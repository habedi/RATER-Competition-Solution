Students shouldn't have to be forced into participating in an extracurricular activity. Why, you might ask? Students shouldn't have to be forced to do something and they should and will have the personal freedom to choose whether or not they should do one. They are responsible and mature enough to make their own decisions on the subject.

Not just students, but everyone should have the personal freedom to what they want when they please, as long as it doesn't break any laws. While it would be good to have every student participate in an after-school activity, they shouldn't be forced to do one. It's better to have the all students participating in an after-school activity statistic come naturally, not have it be forced on them through an unfair and authoritarian rule.

The students are responsible and mature enough to make their own decisions on this topic.

Whether or not they want to do an extra-curricular activity should dictate whether or not they do an extra-curricular activity. If the child is not all that old ,and thus, less mature, they can still make the decision themselves because they, and only they know if they want to do an extra-curricular activity.

In conclusion, students should and will have the personal freedom to make a decision on whether or not they should do an extracurricular activity and they shouldn't have to be forced to make that decision without their explicit consent. Secondly, the students are responsible enough to make their own decisions and should be allowed to do so. Whether or not they want to do an extra-curricular activity should be left up to them, and only them, not their parents, and most definitely not the school and the state.
