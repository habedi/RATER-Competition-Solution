Policy 2 is my favorite because of the following .

I have to agree with policy 2 in some ways. students will be tempted to go over time and miss a class, they might be using the phone for something that is not right and they could get in big trouble, the kids will also be tempted to use in class after using in free time if they had a good talking to their friends and playing games and stuff.

A reason why i don't agree with policy 2 is because if something happens during school and its an emergency and they need to contact a family member they would not have anything to contact them with and even if the school had a phone i would disagree because what if one of the students got caught inside building and no one noticed that someone was missing, the kid that was caught inside the building needs to contact someone so they know were that person is.

Another reason why kids should not have phones in school is because they could be getting answers from the cell phones internet, witch could helped them cheat on a test and that would not improve him at all when he goes to high school or college, if he want to get in a good college you have to get good grade.

The students in their free time might also use the cell phone to contact other friends from another school and get that kid in trouble and that would not be good for that student.

I think that students should have their phones in their locker or where they keep their stuff but if there is an emergency they should be allowed to go get in and contact someone where they are safe or they can get a box where the students put the phones and its by the door so when there is an emergency they can walk out the door with their phones but if they had their phones they would have to be on silent or vibration so they don't distract the class and students that really care about their future.

There is many different options but i think that policy 2 would be the best thing to do for the students and how we use are phones so much It would be hard for us not to use are phones if we had it with us. policy 2 would help the most if there is not an emergency and to keep kids getting good grades and paying attention in class and hurting those who care about their grades and make into the school or job they want. policy 2 is the best fit for cell phones in school.
