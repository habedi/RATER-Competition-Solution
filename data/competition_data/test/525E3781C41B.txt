School can be very stressful at times and it can be hard to not worry about your grades, or other school related issues. So having something to do other then school work would be very beneficial to students. There for, I agree that making extracurricular activities required would be good because it will give students a chance to meet new people, focus on something other than school work and it will keep students out of any trouble that they might have out of school.

Having extracurricular activities required for students would be very helpful because it would give students a chance to meet new people. One extracurricular activity I do is dance, and I can for sure say that I have made some of the best friendships because of it. One really important friendship that I have made is with my friend Generic_Name. She is a year older than me and has been dancing a lot longer, so I can look up to her. I am very thankful that I do dance because I would not have been able to meet one of my best friends. So I agree that doing an extracurricular activity should be required because it would give students a chance to meet new people and make new friends.

Being involved in an extracurricular activity can be good because it will allow students to focus on something other then school work. As a honors student I am required to work very hard in and out of school and it can be very stressful at times. I am required to do homework every night and study for extended periods of time. However, I always look forward to going to dance because it allows me to take a break from all my school work and focus on something I really enjoy doing. It also allows me to relax because when I am done with dance I will be able to go back to my work with a more relaxed mindset. I think that having an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it allows students to take a break and focus on something other then school work.

Having to be in an extracurricular activity would make a good impact on students because it would keep them out of any trouble they would have out of school. I have seen many articles and stories where kids have had a bad background and have gotten into trouble in the past, but then they join an activity and it completely changes who they are as a person. They start to get better grades and start to care more about the people around them and in their community. I think that having students join a activity in or out of school could possibly change their life in a very positive way. There for, I agree that making an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it could keep kids out of any trouble they might get into.

In conclusion, being in an extracurricular activity for me has made a very good impact on my life and as changed my life in a very positive way. It also gives other students something more to do then school work because at times school can be very stressful. So I agree that making extracurricular activities required would be good because it will give students a chance to meet new people, focus on something other than school work and it will keep students out of any trouble that they might have out of school.
