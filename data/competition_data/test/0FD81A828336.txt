We have lots of nieghbors close to us from space by that I mean planets. Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds. Scientist would mostly consider Venus because they feel like it is more controlable than Mars. On the planet's surface on Venus is that they have an average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure 90 times grater than what we experience(paragraph 3). These are verry high temperature and pressure for humans to encounter on earth, even if humans ever went to live on Venus, such an environment would crush our society in the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy many metals(paragraph 3). Beyond that high pressures of heat impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface, such weather like that can kill more than one hundred humans a day. Scientist and astronomers said that, " long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans, mountains, craters, an valleys just like earth"(paragraph 4). NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray, just imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 0r so miles above the landscape on Venus(paragraph 5). They also said that the temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrengeit and the temperaute would still be at close to that sea level on earth. Our travels are beyond but should not belimited by dangerous and doubts but should be expanded to meet edges of imagination aninnovation(paragraph 8).
