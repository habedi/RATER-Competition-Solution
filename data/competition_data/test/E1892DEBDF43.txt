Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students should not be forced to do community service. Children should learn to make the right choices instead of forced onto it. Many children do not have the time to do this much community service. The youth might also not do a very good job at this either. Therefore children should not be forced into community service.

Many children already do community services, because they chose to. You should support this idea but not make it a rule. Extra credit should be given to the students to motivate them. the students need to learn to make the right choices not forced>

some children can not find time in there week to community service>students might even have too much homework to take time for these services>many children are being tutored themselves<and cannot tutor or take any time off to do community work>

teens these days do not try as hard to do community services than other age groups>they might even vandalize the community while they are doing the work>inmates should be forced to do community work instead of teens because the inmates will learn more from it and they will be supervised more carefully>if students are tutoring other students< they might teach the m the wrong ideas>

students have to learn what choices are to be made>many people are plowed with other activities other than community services>most teen wont even try to do this work because they will think its a waste of time>overall students should not be forced to do community service<thank you>

sincerely<
