After World War 2 was over in Europ, many countries were in ruin and everything they had was gone. They needed to get their things back, so to help the other countries, Luke and Don sighned up to be a "Seagoing Cowboy". These, Seagoing Cowboys, were hired to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Not only would you be helping other people you would be doing the right thing.

You would also be able to travel over seas and be able to visit some locations you might have never been to before. You would have an opurtunity to get to help out a WHOLE country! In paragraph 6 it says, "It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the easter coast of the United States and a month to get to China." This shows that it would take a long time to get to other places, and they did travel around the world to help out other people.

In paragraph 8 it says, "Luke also found time to have fun on board, especiallly on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass by the time." This shows that it wasn't boring when they were on their way back from letting animals off of the boat. They would do many things to help pass the time on their long journeys at sea.
