Dear Principal,

As a fellow student of your school for the past 7 years, I have never even thought something as horrid as this plan to not let student with B averages join sports would come. I have brought to your attention some really good reasons that would regret you ever coming up with the idea of students not joining sports with averages under B.

The first reason would be that some students are really gifted and talented at the sports our school has to offer. And to let you know, our school hasn't even won a single trophy ever. So I advise these gifted and talented students to join the sports programs at the school to bring honor and glory to this establishment. Plus, if you don't let them join, you're going to be swamped with parents complaining why you didn't let their son or daughter join a sport at school because of their grade. I know your trying to keep kids from failing and all, but they should do something other than studying or working to get their mind off of some things. This may help them release the tension of studying and work to do something that they absolutely love to do.

The second reason would be that some students get really bored and I know you do to. Some of the students here at school get really bored because theirs no action going on or their is nothing else to do because their always doing work. If they want to join a sport, you should let them join as long as they promise to keep their grade up. Then they wouldn't be so bored all the time. Let me tell you something. On average, kids or teenagers who don't involve themselves in sports don't make friends because they were never around a crowd of people or a big group of kids. They eventually end up doing stupid things and some of those things, they never end up recovering from.

The last and final reason would be that some of the kids would end up failing on purpose and make the school look bad, including you. Some kids like that are very persuasive and usually end up getting what they want and then they get back on track and do better now that they have something to do. Plus the number of kids also get their grades low to get suspended and to make the school look even worse. Those kids end up getting their grades up and joining a sport that they've wanted to join ever since they started school.

So on the terms of parents, bored ness, and looking bad, I would advise to take this rule or soon to be rule
