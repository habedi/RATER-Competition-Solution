Phone Usage should be allowed in school

I think students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch and their free time.

Texting during classes is a big problem.

Every day kids text during classes, in the halls, and at lunch, and every day some kids get them taken away.

The time it takes a teacher to stop class or a kid in the hallway take their phone, and take it to the office; could be used doing something else like grading papers or teaching part of the class.

Having kids turn off their phones during class, or putting them in a box or basket, and letting them use them at other times would save a lot of a teachers time each week.

Another reason to let kids have them is it would stop most texting during class, because kids wouldn't feel the need to text at that time if they could use their phone during passing time, study hall, or lunch.

Kids will use their phones in school anyway so why let them do it on their own time not the teachers.
