I Think it is Good To Change the School Policy For Sports Only Allowing Students With B' s and A' s Only. It Would Let Students Work and Do Better In School If They Want to Participate In Sports At School .Students Would Try Harder or Work Harder At School To Be in a Sports Activity. If You The Principle Starts letting Students with A C Average Students Wouldn't Care About Doing Better In School. Students Know it wouldn't Matter if To be in a A or B Average If The Sports they really wants lets them in with a C average.

Students Would Improve Better at School If The Want To Join Sports In Their School. Then They Would Have to Keep It a A or B Average To Remain In their Sports Activity. So I Think it Would Be Better if You Do Change The Grade Average To Attend Sports in School To A B or A Average. Students Would also think its Fair For Them To Have Atleast a B or A Grade Average For School Sports Activitys='s
