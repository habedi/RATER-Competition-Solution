Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I write you today on behalf of some of my fellow class mates, we are un happy with the required amount of community service hours we have to do. The minimum amount used to be 15 hours a semester, that was a reasonable amount. 30 hours is way to much work for a junior in high school to accomplish along with doing there class work. We are upset with your decision because we would now almost have to do an hour of community service 30 days out of the semester. With sports and academics no body is going to be able to handle this work load. I strongly believe in giving back to the community and helping children and schools but this task shouldn't take up this much of our time. We have other things to do. If every student in our class did 10 hours of service that would be 2000 hours of community service, that is a large amount of time. If we did 30 hours that would be 6000 hours of service which is way too much. Every other high school does this also which means our community is getting tons of service. We are not at all apposed to the work its working every day for an hour would be ridiculous. We all go to school at 8:00 and get out at 3:30, then at 4:00 we have sports practice or band practice. That gets out at around 5:30 sometimes 6:00. Then we go home eat dinner and take a shower. Its about 7:00 and we still have tons of homework and studying to do. By the time all that is finished its 8:30. Then around 8:30 to 9:30 most of us would give ourselves a break go on facebook, watch tv, talk on the phone, its the only time of the day we get a break. So the only other time is during the weekend. Which is supposed to be our break but we would normally spend doing the 15 hours of service. 30 is too much for a teenager like me or my classmates to handle. Some say its not but they know they need a break.

So please could you lower the amount of community service hours? It would take a huge load off everyone's backs. Thank you so much. I will take into consideration there are certain requirements you have to reach but talk to the other teachers and principals.

Sincerely,

Your Class President
