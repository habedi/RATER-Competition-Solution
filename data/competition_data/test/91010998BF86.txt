Dear Principal,

I think that community service is a marvelous idea.

It would help our community be a much better place to live and learn. There would be less liter, which would make it a much cleaner environment. Tutoring is very important and can help children strive in school.

However, not everyone has the time to do all these things. Making it mandatory to do community service would serve as a punishment and would take time away from things students like or need to do. Such as sports, which help students learn valuable skills like teamwork, responsibility, and discipline. Plus, the more a child practices at these sports, the more chance they have on getting a scholarship for them to go to college.

I understand that maybe we need more people doing community service, but not everyone has the time to do it. I think letting community service be voluntary is a better idea.

Sincerely,
