Dear Principal.

I support policy 1 students should be able to bring cell phones to school and use them during free time. The reason i support this is there could be an accident at school and school phones aren't working, the student may stay after school and need a ride too get home, and finally the student may have a medical condition that is not on file. these are the reasons I support policy 1.

The 1st reason I support policy 1 is there could be an accident at school. There could be an attack at the school and the culprit moves all the teachers away from there phones. Who are they going too depend on? The students who have cell phones too call law enforcement.

the student that does have a cell phone could call and stop precious lives from being lost.

The second reason I support the 1st policy is the student may need a ride too and from school. picture this, it's late after every one has left the building and went home accept one kid who doesn't have a cell phone. He may have too walk home alone and could possible be endangered by some of the crazy people that we unfortunately have in this world. It could be your kid, it could be a student like me.

The third and final reason I support policy 1 is there could be a student with a medical condition that is not on file. imagine there being a student that suddenly began too have a seizure. your afraid and you cant get in contact with the mother and don't know the fathers number you could simple pull the students phone out go into there contacts and call the parents again or call another gradin of the student. You wouldn't want this too happen and probably believe this wont happen but accidents do happen.

These are the reasons i support policy 1. please take in consideration what iv just wrote you. also please keep my pre in mind while you read others.

sincerely : Concerned student.
