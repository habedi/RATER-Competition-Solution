Every student has different and unique interests. Giving them the ability to choose a summer project themselves benifits them personally more. A project that one student would love, another student could hate. Letting student choose their project, will allow them to work on something they are passionate about; when a student is passionate about their work, they are more likely to fully go into that project. Every student has a different schedule in the summer, interests, and goals they want to achieve, so giving them the ability to personalize their project to what they wants, will end up producing better work.

Letting students design their own summer project lets them pick one that they are truly interested in. Students could design a project that is related to what they want to do after highschool. It is more benifical to the student to work on a project that is about something they are passionate about; it is also more useful to learn about something you want to learn in the future. For example, a student may want to go into education as a career, so they would have the option to pick a project that is related to that, such as volunteer work with childern. This allows for a more real life experience with the project they decide to work on. They will learn more than just simple things school work can teach. They could learn about a area of work that they are passionate about and get experience that will be useful later on in life.

Summer is a time students can have much more than just school work going on. They may be traveling, going to camps, or doing one of their hobbies all summer. If students have the ability to personalize a project for themselves, they can create a project that is a good fit for their schedule over the summer. They can also incorporate experiences they are having over the summer into their projects. That makes for hands on learning; the students can take from things going on in their life and turn it into an educational experience for themselves. I know from personal experience that I always have a very busy summer, so certain types of projects would be very hard for me to balance with my other activities. If I was given the option to pick a project that I could incorporate into my everyday life I would have a lot easier and less stressful time working on that project. Summer will always be the students free time, so they should be able to choose how they are spending that time. They should be able to design a project that works well with their lives in the summer.

Every student has gone through a project that is on a topic they couldn't care less about. Those types of projects are usually very hard for the students. It can make the student not excited to learn. Teachers want their students to be excited to learn, so they should create the enviroment that allows their students to be excited to learn about whatever they are working on. When students have experience projects that they are interested in and they always turn out to be a fun learning experience. The students won't just be doing the project for a grade, they will be doing the project because it actually interests them. If students were allowed to design their summer project, then they could make the project to be on a topic that they are passionate about. Having the project on a subject they are passionate about, the student will take much more in from the learning experience. Not only will they have fun while working on the project, but they will also be more willing to go above and beyond while working on the project.

Summer projects should be student designed. There are many ways a student being able to design their own project benifits the student. It will create a more meaningful learning experience. It also create more depth to their educational experience. It won't just be a project eveyone else got assigned, it will be something they personally made, that they are interested in learning about. Student can personalize it to create a project they will be passionate and proud of. Allowing students to design their own summer projects creates a more enjoyable working enviroment; the students will take much more away than just facts they had to learn for the projectts. They will have a wonderful experience learning about something they love.
