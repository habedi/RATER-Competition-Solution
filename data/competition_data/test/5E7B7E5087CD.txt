Have you ever had a feeling when you absolutely can not wait for something? Well that is how I feel about getting my license. I feel like when you have them you will have the oppurtunity to do much more then sit at home. I don't really think I would enjoy the driverless cars just because i love driving, but older people might enjoy it.

Driverless cars would take a lot of trust to be able to get in the vehicle and let it drive you at a high speed rate. To me at this moment i think driving is a blast and I don't understand why people do not like it. The idea of being behind the wheel of something that can travel you to just about anywhere in the world if you have the time and money to drive there. If we did end up creating driverless cars then we wouldn't worry about speeding a whole lot or the elders driving really slow.

I would worry way to much in a drverless car, eventhough I know the technolgy is through the roof. In my head there is way to many bad things that might happen: going off the road, the car has a power outage, the car just randomly starts to go faster when it needs to slow down. It is just that anything in the world could happen no matter how good our technology is there is going to be atleast one accident. Anything could happen I think it is too risky.

There is this feeling you get when you just can't stand to wait any longer. with driverless cars i think it would ruin the fact that you have your drivers license. Yes you can still go to a lot of places but it just isn't the same and it wouldn't be as much fun neither. I think they shouldn't develop these cars in my lifetime.
