Some schools offer ditance learning as a option for students."

That means you can study from home is well, For example people who work too much like me it would be fine because i do not have the enough time to go to school during the mornings however students can attend to online school from home when they have time to do it.

"Also the school offer online video or conferencing to help students."

For example videos can help you to understand what is happening around the world and it helps you how you can do the assigment, but i like conferencing because i can talk with real people and get a better explication like more cleared details from conferencing.

" Students would recieve some benefit from being able to attend classes from home ." yes it is a benefit because for example students who cannot being capable to attend to a real high school in the morning like girls need take care of a baby because she already have one or young men who have a full time jobs because they already have a family and they want to support them, So it would be a really good idea for people who wants the high school diploma and they cannot attend to high school during the normal schedule like in the morning.

In conclusion some schools offer distance learning as a option for students, and offer online video recording to help students, also students would recieve some benefit from being able to attend classes from home, In conclusion in my opinion some schools offer distance learning to help students to get their high school diploma for example students who do not have the enough time to attend to school in a normal schedule it would be a fantastic opportunity to study from home.
