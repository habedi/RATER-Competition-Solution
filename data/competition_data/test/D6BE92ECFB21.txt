In this essay I will be writing about an arguement about the face being a natural lanform. I'll give evidence to my essay to support my claim of the arguement. I'll also do an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to my argumentative essay. I'll will do this in order to my arguement for this essay and I'll first start with my arguement of the scientist or person of the Face being created by aliens and then I'll support it with evidence from the article and last I'll ended it with refreshing of what I was talking about in the essay.

I'll tell the person that thinks that the Face being created by aliens by saying that how will the Face be created by aliens if they would make more of those faces. We humans make building and later on make better or different than before and do think they should have made it bigger or different than before because it has been 25 years since that Face has been there and mothing has change from it but only of how we took the picture. The Face from paragraph 5 shows the face and looks like it had a nose, mouth and eyes from the picture. I can support all of this details from telling you that in paragraph that it said that " NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possilbe landing sites for its sister ship," the reason I told you this is because if the spacecraft was taking photos of the planet then it could of took a photo of an alien or other more of the Face. They been circling the planet to take the photos in 1976, 1998 and 2001 they done this and they never seen the alien or more Faces.

So I was able to show of what to tell to the person if the any person said if it was created by the aliens. Also I was able to tell what would say and gave evidence to the person from the article. I did the introduction, body and conclusion to the essay and made sure if I put of what to be sure to include in this essay. I also check the checklist of any mistake I'd put on the essay or forgot to put in the essay. That is all of what to put in this essay to make sure I got everything to finish this essay.
