To the principal.

Policy 1 states that cell phones are ok during lunch and other free times but must be turned off during class time. I think I can speak for our entire school that, that is the way to go. For these reasons.

Firstly, everyone uses phones anyway and get in trouble so if it's ok then a lot more kids won't get in trouble. Meaning it won't affect there school record. Meaning they can better there education. Meaning they can design a new alternative fuel. Meaning they can change the world and it's thanks to passing this new policy.

Next, is kids want feel like there free. Look, we kids don't have many rights as it is. Our schedule is Wake up, School, homework, bed. I mean come on that's messed up. We can't access the creative side of our minds if we can't play on our phones.

Lastly , I just plainly think no phone policy is stupid. Many kids nowadays have expensive phones and if we can't use it what's the point. Most of our parents gave us the phone in order to call them if we run into trouble so if there's a fight or something going down and we don't want in then we call someone to pick us up. It's that simple.

I hope you can understand my reasoning. We the Kids of the nation deserve at least one right and that right is to enable us to use our phones.

Thank You,
