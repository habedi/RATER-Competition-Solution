Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't believe that students should be required to perform any community service hours. If it is not something that they want to do then why make them? Besides even if you did make it a requirement there are some students that would not do it. If you did want to include community service as part of a grade, why not make it an extra credit opportunity. That way if students are behind they can get their grades back up.

If you know that there are kids that wont do the community service then why would you even think about making it a requirement? That would just end up hurting them even more. You are the principal and if you think you know what's best for your students than you wouldn't make community service a requirement.

If you want community service to be part of our school than make it an extra credit opportunity. But don't make it a requirement to where you want every student to participate because there are many student that won't. Don't do something that will end up hurting some students' grades.
