Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, and are either designed by their teacher, or designed by the students. In my opinion, these projects should be designed by the teacher. I believe this because teachers are more likely to have more knowledge about the next level of learning than the students would know, and therefore, would be able to put better information that would most likely to be more effective for the student as they move on. Also, the teacher would know better about how much work each individual student needs to have and what their limits are as well. Students could also reach out to their teachers in case the students summer plans would get in the way of their summer project, allowing teachers to know how much the amount of work should be given out to the students so they can both work, and get some r and r. Finally, teacher-designed projects would be most likely be very similar to each other and would be easier to grade for the next teacher, and allow students to recieve assistance from other students in case their teacher is not available for help.

The first reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher usually knows more about the upcoming classes the student will have to take when the summer is over and school starts up again than the student would. The teacher would be able to select the topics for the summer assignment the students would need to know in order to get ready and be prepared for the next grade. In case they do not know what to do, most students would have to take time out of their day to find out about what they will be learning about in the next school year if they are designing the summer project by themselves, and that time could have been easily used to be working on their summer assignment.

Another reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher would be able to know what each individual student can and cannot do, and will be able to give out the most appropriate amount of work needed for each student so the student can succeed. Since every individual is different and learns at different speeds and learns things differently, this will allow students to be able to learn incredibly well and be prepared at their own pace.

In case summer plans would get in the way of the students summer projects, they should be able to get in touch with their teacher and learn what they could do to get the project done on time. This could involve less work or maybe a different assignment than what they first received to fit what the students summer plans will be. This allows for students to get a healthy amount of work in the summer while getting rest and doing summer activities.

My final reason on why teacher-designed summer projects would be better than if the students designed them, is that teacher assigned projects could be similar to each student and would be less difficult to grade. Also, it would allow students to recieve help from other students that would help them succeed.

This concludes my essay whether summer projects would be better if they were designed by students, or made by the teachers, I believe that if teachers designed them, it would allow a more fitting learning experience, better information on what students should know, and the amount of work that is needed for each student.
