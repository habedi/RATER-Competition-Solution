Our world is constantly changing and evolving. New technology is coming out everyday that provides us with new ways to do things; from how we access information to the way in which we order our food at a fast food restaurant. The way of the world is moving forward and we need to move with it. Allowing students to stay at home and take classes in the comfort of their own bed is an excellent way to move forward. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because the student could work at their pace and they can work on their time schedule.

Firstly, students would benefit from being able to attend class at home because they can work at their pace. Every student's brain is different. We all think differently and work at a different speed than everyone else. When at school, if you are a slow worker, it is difficult to keep up with the pace the teacher is going. It's harder to take adequate notes and complete work assignments on time. For example, I have a friend, Generic_Name, who is a lot slower at school than most kids. She has to take her time with work because she has a learning disability. This makes it hard for her to learn well enough because she is always behind in her classes. If Generic_Name could take her classes at home, she would be able to move as slow as she would like without falling behind or missing important class work.

Lastly, students would benefit from being able to attend class at home because it would allow them to follow their own schedule. Many students have multiple tasks to take care of after school. They do sports, and have a job, and have family and friends, or they have hours of homework to do. Going to a physical school, isn't what's best for everyone. For example, I have many things to do on a daily bases. Along with being a student, I am an employee at a demanding fast food chain, I am an active member of a volunteering club, and I have piles of homework. A challenge that I face everyday is whether or not I have the time to do everything. If I had the ability to do some of my classes at home, it would relieve my schedule. I would have more room for the things I have to accomplish to succeed.

Many students would love to have the chance to never leave home for school. This will give students all over the ability to better understand work and do better in school, However, many people will say that if we allow students to take classes at home, they will procrastinate and not get things done. I believe that with this option, students will not take it lightly. They will get their work done no matter what. I hope you make the call to give students the option of classes online so they can better their themselves and their school life.
