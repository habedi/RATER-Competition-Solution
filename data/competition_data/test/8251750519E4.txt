There are many things to find and explore in our Solar system. What we find is used to exlain questions we have been asking for most of our lives. Exploring Venus would futher our quest for answers, that's somthing everyone can agree on. But is studying Venus worth facing all the hash conditions? The author of

"The Challenge of Exploring Venus" believes that is is worth it to study Venus despite its dangers; beacuse it is Earths "twin", there are ways to touch ground, and it will bring many discoveries.

To begin, Venus is our sister planet or as its often reffered to Earths "twin". It has the same relative desity and size as Earth. But Venus' suface is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. With the distance between Earth and Venus studying its rocks, gas or anything is relativly impossible. That is why studying Venus with people going there is ideal.

Furthermore, NASA has been working on some technology that will help humans go to Venus and benefit study. An example of this technology is stated in the passage. "Some simplified electons of silicon carbon have been tsted in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's suface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions". This would make it easy for someone to go down on Venus's surface. Giving them a way to collect the rocks and other samples.

Moreover, as said in the passasge, " striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value." We can lern more about what might hav lived there in years prior. We might also learn thing about Earth since they are so closely similar. Also we are more then likely to be lead in that direction. This is just a way to get closer to the future.

In conclusion, the exploration of Venus is worth it despite the dangers. Venus is Earths' "twin" making it another way to learn about our past. Advances in technology are working twoards getting to the surface for samples. And with those two factor we are bound to discover thing that we have no knowledge of yet. Besides at the rate we grow curious we will eventually be lead to many endeavors much like this.
