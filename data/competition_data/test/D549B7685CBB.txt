Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think its fair that only students with a grade B average are allowed to participate in school sports. Many students that enjoy playing sports do not have a grade B average. If this policy was on, then not many people would be allowed to play. Many famous sports players weren't grade B average when they went to school. What if a student loves to play Basketball but wasn't allowed to play just because he had a C on his report card. That would be like interfering with his future if some day he wants to become a professional Basketball player. It shouldn't really matter what there grades are to let them do something they enjoy and love. I know that you would be mad if somebody told you couldn't play your favorite sport just because of some grade. Just because you have low grades on your report cards doesn't mean your bad at everything. I myself get a D once in a while but I'm good at acting and playing Volleyball. It really hurts when somebody forbids you to do something that you enjoy doing just because you have one D or F. Please think of the students that you will be hurting. That probably will think that they are not good enough for anything. Don't make them believe that because everybody is good at something, but this policy will leave them thinking that there dumb. So please think twice of what decision your going to take and remember, you don't want to let your students know that they are not good for nothing.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
