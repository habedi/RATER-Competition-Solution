Have you ever thought of being a Seagoing Cowboy? If you haven't you should really think about. Being an Seagoing Cowboy has many benefits. For example, you get to go on many trips around the world and go to places such as Europe and China and much more places. Another benefit is helping people and taking care of animals. My final reason is that it helps you be more aware of people in different countries and their ways of living and it's fun.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy gives you the chance to visit many places. I got to go to Europe and China. Seeing Acropolis was special. So was taking a a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with water for streets. I also toured an castle in crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Me and the other Seagoing Cowboys also crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States to get to China.

The other benefit was helping people and taking care of animals. Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. On my second trip, I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour. We had to help people in other countrys by recovering their food suplies, animals, and other needs.

The final benefit was that it helps you be more aware of people in different countrys and their needs. The opportunity made me more aware of how the people in different countrys lived and how they dont have their needs and how i was helping them with their needs. Being a Seagooiing Cowboy also is fun. On return trips we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had stayed. Table-tennis tournaments, boxing,fencing,reading,whittling, and games were fun ways to pass the time.
