Dear principal,

I think you should make students perform community service for their own good. Community service will help the student for their education also to help them get in to college. For example my sister took community service for high school and that helped her to get good grades for high school and now she's attending SCHOOL_NAME.

Therefore, community service is not a waste of time, it might be for other but for my opinion its not a waste of time, its actually a very important time for our goal and education. Cleaning up litter is very important to keep our state very clean and neat to show others we can keep everything nice and in order.

Litter is very bad for our state like we need to keep away trash from our oceans to not provide the ocean animals to get killed or sick for some trash we had to cause. Another important thing is that its good that tutors help us get good education.

In conclusion, I think students should take community service for their own good and their future in life. People may think its a waste of time but it isn't at all. I learned this from my older sister doing her community in service during school and now she is getting her currier and doing good job at her University.

So that's why I think you should require all students to perform community service.
