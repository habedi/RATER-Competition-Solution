The author supports the suggestion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by providing benifits and solutions to exploring Mars.

In the text it states 'Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like plantet in our solar system'. This shows that by studying Venus we may learn that Venus was once like Earth.

In the text it also states 'recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit'. This shows that Venus is the easiest to get to in terms of speed/time.

Finally they provide ways that space agencies are working on solutions to exploring Mars. For this, the text states 'NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray'.

These support the authors' suggestion by showing reasons as to why we should study Venus and the fact that agencies already are researching solutions to exploring Venus.
