On a rainy Tuesday morning, you walk to the bus stop with the clothes you wore yesterday, messed up hair, and such baggy, dark eyes you could go get groceries with them. Once you get to the bus stop you lay down on the wet concrete floor and shut your eyes. Someone accidentally kicks you in the arm. After that you open your eyes slower than a sloth, and notice there is three more people at the bus stop. You also notice that they're all wearing the same clothing from yesterday as well. In addition to that they also have baggy eyes and messy hair. You start wondering why we are all like that. The bus gets there and the bus driver honks at all of you for laying on the floor. Generic_Name ,your best friend leads the way onto the bus. "Ya'll look like dirty slugs. are ya'll okay?," your bus driver, Ms Generic_Name asks in a high pitched voice. No one responds back. The whole bus ride is dead silent which gives you a chance to get some rest. "Hey, Generic_Name have you finished the science homework," you ask with a sleepy toned voice. She responds, "Yea, i spent all night doing it." Those were the only words spoken during the entire bus ride. Once you got to school the principal greeted you and your fellow classmates with a wide grin. Walking down the hall was difficult because of the lack of energy in everybody. "Hello class i hope everybody got more sleep than i did," your teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, mumbles. "Today we will learn about the four comma rules. This is very important so pay attention." Even with your teacher's warning you still zone out and wonder why your principal would make you all take an extracurricular activity when you already have so much to do. You start closing your eyes slowly trying to fight back the sleepiness, but you dont put much of a fight and you fall asleep. I disagree with the principal's decision because if we all had to participate in a extracurricular activity students wouldn't have time to do their homework, students would be stressed out, and would lead students to think they are disappointments.

First, one of the reasons I dont agree with the principle's decision is because students wouldnt have time to complete his/her homework. Students with AP classes already learn enough in one day and need time outside of school to complete assignment. Asking for good grades when having no time at home is like asking for superpowers. For example, imagine coming home from soccer and having seven classes worth of homework due the next day. In addition only having five hours to complete it. "Sorry ma'am, but your son has lost 28 pounds and also has an eating disorder," the doctor says. Your mother responds with, "But how can i get him to eat." "Im too busy to eat mom," you reply while working on a history project. The doctor looks at you with a worried look and says, "Look kid you have to eat even if your too busy or else youll die!" Your mom looks at the doctor and asks, "He's been like this since he started soccer." The doctor replies, "Soccer? Is that why you don't have time?" You have a flash back of when your principal announced that everybody will be taking an extracurricular class after school. "Why dont you just drop out of soccer, then you will have more time after school," the doctor says. " Because my principal is forcing us to take an extracurricular class and I have homework from every class, thats why Im too busy."

Another reason that I disagree with the principals decision is because students will get stressed out. School can already be stressing enough and when you add better time managing, which activity you should take, and still getting enough sleep its asking for too much. Student will get stressed no matter what under those conditions. Stress can lead to many things like mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts. For example, you come home with a lot of homework to do. You run upstairs to get started on the homework. Hours later you finished three and need two more assignments to be finished, but its nine o'clock already."eek," the door squeaks and your dad pops out and says, "Hey, lights out, go to bed" you reply with, "OK dad, good night." A couple of weeks go by and each day the same thing happens, you have to much work and such little time. One day your teacher puts down your report card and says, " I might have to call your parents. You haven't been turning in your assignments". You go home and show your parents the report card. They look at you with a disappointment look. This is another reason why I disagree with the principal. More and more of this happens you find yourself crying because you can't do anything and it seems like your life is on repeat. One day you Say to yourself, "If I were gone out of this life no one would care in fact people would be happy, so then I would never disappoint them again." You go on to tie a noose and hang yourself.

On a Wednesday morning, you wake up knowing you didnt do all of your work. You go to school tired. You get to class a bit late because you didnt feel like speed walking. "Beep," the announcements come on, "This is you principal speaking, from now on you will no longer be forced to do an extracurricular activity instead you will go home like you used to."Suddenly a burst of energy rushes out of you and you shout in joy, you realize that you arent the only one. The whole school is shouting, some people are even going down on their knees and crying of joy. Weeks go by and you are back to your old self except you have an eating disorder and a bad sleeping habit. Once again you are getting good grades and you dont have anymore bad thoughts in your head. "Congratulations, you made it to the AB honor role. we are so proud of you!" your parents say in harmony. In conclusion, I disagree with what the principal has decided because if we all had to participate in a extracurricular activity students wouldn't have time to do their homework, students would be stressed out, and would lead students to think they are disappointments.
