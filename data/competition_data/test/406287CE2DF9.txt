Dear Principal,

I think that not allowing phones at all would be your best choice. When the students are at school, they are there with their friends so they don't actually need their phones with them to communicate. The students don't need to text their friends at lunch when they could just walk over to them and say hi. The students need to learn important social skills to get through life, and cell phones could cause them not to learn these skills.

Second, even if phones were just allowed during free time, I'm sure you'd see their effects elsewhere, too.

Having phones during school would encourage cheating because is gives the students silent ways exchange answers. Also, you might also find that the students are less focused on the material they are learning and more focused when they can next update their facebook status.

Lastly, if students are in the middle of a conversation on their phones when lunch ends, it's very likely they won't stop the conversation just because they have to go to class. You might find that students are going to the bathroom to use their phones or texting their friend from under the desk. This leads to not paying attention in class and missing out on important information, which can affect their grade by a lot.

As you can see, it would be best to keep your school phone-free for the good of the students and their social skills. The students can live without their phones for six hours a day, and they can actually talk to their friends instead of texting them. I strongly believe that you should not allow phone on your school grounds and I very much hope you agree with me.

Sincerely,
