I remember the stories my dad use to tell me about how in cuba he would have to walk 6 miles to get to school. Or when he got here that to work he would ride his bike to & from work. Cars are being put into use for no reason, people now a days go in the car to to the winn dixie thats right across the street. Do you know how much money is put into cars? you have to pay for gas, or if your car breaks down or has a leak. Cars are a huge investment and they are very dangerous to our society, the pollution cars cause i horrendous. Now don't get me wrong I would prefer to go in a car on a 3 hour ride to Orlando from Naples, i mean who would want to walk 1000s of miles? but to get in the car to get dropped off at school when you live 5 minutes away? thats ridiculous.

In Germany car use has been dropping and it has proven to provide a cleaner enviorment, healthier living and huge savings. Near the French and Swiss borders, it is forbidden to have hoe garages, street parking and drive ways. The streets are considered to be car-free zone. There are a few streets that cars are allowed, you can park in a larage car garage or at the edge of a development. But the parkng space is not free the parking space in $40,000, along with a home. Obviously that price is alittle bit pricey for people so 70% of theses families do not own cars and 50% acctually sold a car to be able to live there. The Enviormental Protection Agency is strongly trying to promote reducing cars and/or car usage all throughout the united states.

What comes to your head when you think about Paris? love, romance, coffee shops, expensive dinners on the effile tower. How about pollution, having to stay inside because the health cocerns? Paris has recently banned driving due to the pollution revolving th city of love. Motorists ere requested to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 dollar fine, to some people the $31 dollars did not effect them so they kept driving and were fined. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had there cars impounded due to innappropriate reaction to recieving this fine. After 5 days of what frances citizens would call torture 60% of congestion was down, believe it or not Paris was rivaling Beijing, China known for having one of the most polluted streets in the world! The blame was put on diesel fuel, 67% of frances cars use diesel engines. Paris has moresmog than other european captials like london or brussels. Imagine how much clearer Paris would be if this car ban lasted a year!

Imagine how nice it would be to have zero traffic, no rush to get home. but how would you feel if the reason behind this traffic free day you had to ride a bike or go on the bus? you would probably take that traffic over a little exercise or having to stand next to a stranger. In Bogota, Colombia the have a event called "a car-free day" in this day colombians all gathered as they skated, biked or rode the bus to get to their destination. If you violated this you would have to fance a $25 dollar fine. The goalpf this even was to promote alternative transportation but to also hope for less smog. During this day not even rain could stop these colombians from participating in this event. Some people saw this as a save the world act also to relieve stress.

Cars are a way to travel long distances and should be used every once in a while but the world is asking you please put an end to this, use of cars for every little thing, start to set a goal to live a happier healthier life and create a safe eviorment by ending car use, Start small like riding a bycicle to the grocery store, then decide to take a walk to the neighbors right around the street.
