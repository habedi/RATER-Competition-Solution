Many people think that the face on mars is a monument created by aliens, but these people are mistaken. Scientists have many sources of evidence that shows that this face is just a natural landform on Mars.

First, after NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the image caption said," huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This tells us that right away NASA never thought it was anything casued by aliens. Also, in paragraph 5, the texts states, "Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars - evidence that NASA would rather hide." But when you think about it, this wouldn't make much since. Defenders of the NASA budget wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars because it would help out their cause for NASA.

Next, NASA sent more scientists into space to do more research. When the Scientists got there on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a photo ten times sharper than the first Viking photos. Then in the article, it says, " Thousads of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." This shows us that after they went back into space with newer cameras and better aquipment the Face on Mars was just a natural land form.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars wasn't actually a face at all. The article states," what the picture is really showing is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. " It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Gavin."That's the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."
