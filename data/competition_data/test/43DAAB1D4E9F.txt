Dear Principal,

I think it is a good idea for student to have to do community service if they want to. It makes the community nicer and not as messy and dirty. The students would do better in school because they would take pride in their community. Everyone would think the students are great for helping people. If they volunteered to do things the town would be a better place. If the students went to the senior center the people in it would feel better and more relaxed. The students might make friends at the senior center and go back when not in school. If they helped at a animal shelter and fed, watered, and got to know the animals they might adopt one or suggest one to a friend. The elementary students would be smarter and the older students might learn some things. I do not thing they have to do it if they do not want to. It should be for extra credit or a prize raffle. If the student has some thing better to do that is fine. They might have to catch up on homework or spend time with family. They should not have to go if they are allergic to dogs or have to help younger students if they need help themselves.

If some want to have fun that is fine. More people would do it if it was fun to help or if they got to do it with friends. For example, if the kids family is going to on a camping trip they should not have to go. They could be doing community service on their own and not have to do it in school. Their parents could sign a slip so they do not have to if they volunteer with family

Hopefully,

Student
