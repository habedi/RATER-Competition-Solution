Dear Ms. principal,

I have heard that you are thinking about changing the policy for after school activity's that you have to have at least a B average. I do not agree with this change because many students who are participating in these school activity's are trying their hardest to get C' s and if you take away their after school activity's they might just stop trying all together.

Many of the students in this school depend on these activity's to get them through the day. They might not have the best at home life, and they like that they can get their mind of things while playing basketball or at book club. To some students these activity's are their life's away from home, to some its the only reason they even come to school in the morning.

If you say that they must have a B average many will think that they can never get there and many will just quite before even trying. I understand where you are coming from thinking that this will just make the students try harder but many are already under pressure to keep there grades at a C and they will just break if you put this pressure on them . Maybe you could make it a C+ average that way yes the grade will come up but they wont seem like its to much pressure. Even just talking to these groups would do something telling them that they are leaders of this school and they need to lead by an example.

I think you are only looking at the bright side of things but think about if you do this and people just quite the teams and club then what are you going to do? What about those few smart kids who acutely care? Are you going to keep book club with one student? Are you going to have basketball team with 10 players? Or are you going to have to tell those few kids that you can't have these clubs and teams anymore just because you wanted to push the students a little farther. The students are already trying hard and they are pushing themselves but there is a limit to everything.

Please think this over before you decide about changing the policy. Students at this school need the after school activity's just because they aren't the best in the classroom doesn't mean you should take away the things they love. I fear if you do some students will just stop caring about school at all , then what would you do? You have no way to make them care again because guess what? If you take it away and they let their grades drop they will never care enough to get them back up even if you change the policy again. I hope you see our side of it to, I know basketball is my life right now and I don't know what i would do if you took that away from me because I have no where to run after this. My parents are done with me and so are my grandparents , this team really has turned in to mine and many others family away from home please don't take this away.

sincerely,
