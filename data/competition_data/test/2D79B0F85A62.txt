Phones have become the common distraction as of today. Everywhere you turn, there are phones in every hand either talking or texting even as people are driving. No one should be allowed to drive and be on their phone at the same time. People should be focusing on the road and not their phone because it's dangerous for other drivers on the road and themselves. There are many accidents that happen just because someone isn't paying attention to the road.

Phones shouldn't be allowed on the road as someone is driving because it can be dangerous for people that walk and can cause uncertain deaths.

Many people walk to their destinations to meet friends or to even go to work if it's close. They should be able to cross the road without having to worry about a car plowing them down. If someone is driving and they're focusing on their phone, they wouldn't be able to see the person walking across the street. A phone shouldn't have that much of a hold over you. A lot of deaths happen just from people not diverting all of their attention to the road. They're too busy typing on their phones, trying to send a message that could have waited until they reached where they were going. Another life gone down the drain all because a driver paid more attention to their phone than the road.

Drivers are distracted while they're on the phone meaning they aren't paying any mind to the cars behind or in front of them. Accidents can happen anywhere at any time of the day. There are so many car crashes that happen on the highways and most of the time, it is because the driver was on their phone. People can get injured or worse, they can die from the sudden impact of the crash. Therefore, drivers should keep their eyes and mind on the road to prevent the death of injury of someone else.

Phones are the biggest distraction to drivers as of today and they should be banned from use when driving. People believe that there are more drunk driving deaths than there are driving and texting deaths. Eventually, a law will have to be made to prevent driving while on you are on your phone. In other words, no one should use their phones while they're driving because of the horrible damage it could do to someone else.
