Phones and Driving

Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed.

In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.

As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field ("Distracted Driving") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.

Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .
