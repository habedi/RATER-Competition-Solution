Venus, Future planet earth?

Should we take more risks and stop being limited by danger and doubts? I think that the author give such good information to support his idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers.

My first reason about i think the author give good information is because he actually uses real information about spacecrafts that did not survive the landing in Venus for more than a few hours. But then he restate this facts and he says: "If Venus is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface? And he answers this question saying that it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system so then it's a good idea to try landing its surface.

The author also recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but then he ask himself, What are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive? He start explaining that the NASA's possible solution for that issue is a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way, and that idea makes me agree with the author because it is real information about the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

To conclude my essay that the author supported very well his idea, he gave a lot of important information about Venus and also about why it's a good idea to start studying this planet. We have to start meeting the very edges of imagination and innovation.
