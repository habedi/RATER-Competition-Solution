Dear Principal

I strongly believe that students should be aloud to attend school sports with a C or higher average, not a B average. Here's why.

First of all, people learn at different rates. Some people have to work very hard to get just Bs and Cs. While some other people can get As with no trouble at all. In short everyone works differently. Also it depends on the teacher to some teachers are simply unfair and hate certain students, while favoring others. Also a C means AVERAGE not failing, that's a F.

Second of all, sports take up a lot of time and energy. Some students simply can't keep up with the amount of homework their teachers give out. They also have to leave school for games during the day. So they miss a lot of class time and assignments in class. They down have as much time to do their homework because they're at practice.

Third of all, they use their time and talents to help the school win games. It's not the teachers out there throwing a baseball or running with a football down the field and most certainly isn't the principal dribbling down the court with a basketball.

They don't have to be on the team, they want to. They are out the fighting for our school like knights fighting for a country while the principal sits in his big cushiony "throne" watching.
