Should we do one extracurricular activity!

I honestly think it would not be a bad idea . But there is no way it will work. Because if you are doing these extra activities you are being taking out of class. So you are not learning, that means you are having to extra work,you will not get all your work done, you would cum to school tired every day. I will give you more information all right he we go.

OK so if you are not learning ,you will not have a grate chance of going to college at that point. Because you will have so many things to thank about, you Walt be able to think about college. + you would want to take off of school and most of the time. Ween you want to take off of school will most likely dont go to college. Then it mess their life up. To the point were they dont go, or go in there 30 to 40.

Now if you have bad grades how can you go to college. Now you are wondering why i am saying this. because some people are slower than outer and that is not a bad thing. Most of the time that is normal. And if they cant get the the best grades now, they might not even go to the next grade.

So if you do all this work you will get tired. And if you are tired you will miss all work. You will be sleeping in class so that answer your question in the being of the par graft that we are on. then we have bad grades.

I dont know what you thank about it but i want you to know i put my best into these sol.
