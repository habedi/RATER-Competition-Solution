Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it would be nice to be able to bring our phones to school and only use them at lunch or any other free time we have. We should be able to have the phones on in school just not aloud to have them on where you could hear it. But, having the phones in school and being able to use them whenever we have a free period is a good idea. I think this policy is better because what if someone or a family member has to tell you something very important.

I mean sometimes parents don't like to call because they know they student is in school so they'd rather text them. Instead of calling them because maybe they don't want they news broadcasted on the intercom. I don't think having the students not bring their phones to school is a good solution. Either way you put it they are going to bring their phone , or whatever else technology they have.

So I think letting the students be able to bring their phones is a good solution , because you are letting them use it at a certain time of the day maybe more because students may have a free period twice a day. Well all I'm saying is that you should take a good look into letting students bring there phone to school at least they wouldn't have they phone out only the time there aloud to use it. Like when you see teachers on there phone it's like oh ok i could use my phone to. But when they see the student use there phone it's a problem. i don't find that to be fair.

The other policy I personally believe is not a good solution , because either you put it students are going to bring there phone. You will see there phone out more than ever. And if you ask for it you wouldn't get it. They going to ignore you and act like they can't hear you with all the music they are listening to. So yeah i think it would be nice for you to look forward into having that policy you never know you might see improvement in things.

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
