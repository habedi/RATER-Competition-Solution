The Facial action coding system is a good idea to used in estudents beacuse almost the 50% of the students are shy an they dont want to ask when they are confused and bored so if teachers know how they feel they can help them. A classroom computer could reconigze when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts."then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ." the same technology can make computers-combined faces more expressive- for video games or videos surgery. Many people are going to like this becuase that can help techers, students, and all people that cna get it. Did you know that exist a new sofwart making by Dr. Paul Eckman called " The Facial Aciton Coding" that indentify the humans emotion that it can used in all people bout we can used in students to show how they are feeling. The process begin when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major mucles in the model must move like humans muscles. movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit". Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions that are happiness, surprise, anger, disguits, fear and sadness -and then associated each whit characteristic movements os the facial muscles. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, Dr. Huang thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly), The software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a natural face showing no emotions. the monal lisa demostration is really intendet to bring a smile to your face. Imagine making a computer that know when you are sad or happy it can be good for people. In conclusion this idea is really amazing besause it helps people and almost all the people are confused beacuse they dont know how they feel about something, this computer with the sofware it can be good for school because al students got confiused in something bout someones are shy an they dont want to ask to the teachers to make the aclaration about the thing that they are confiused and it can be better for teachers making more things intesting.
