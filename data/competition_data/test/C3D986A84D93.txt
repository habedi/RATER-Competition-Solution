Do you think kids should be forced to do extracurricular activities? No, I disagree with kids being forced to do extracurricular activities. Kids shouldn't be forced to do after school activities just because the principle wants them to. Kids should have the option of saying if they are going to or not. You have to see if the students are able to go without any obstacles or even if they want to do extra circular activities. There are many kids where there are issues to get to places issues of even getting permission.

First, kids come to school to learn and parents pick them up but some don't because they have to work or run errands, so the kids take the bus. Sometimes there is not a bus after school or in a regular sport. A lot of the times you need a parent or guardian to pick the student up. Picking kids up right after work can be stressful because of traffic and sometimes parents aren't even home with extracurricular actives are over. So it would be very difficult for parents and kids to go and not be able to get picked up. It would also be scary for the child, knowing that you don't know how you are going to get home. Why make it stressful for both people when you can have a choice to go.

Next, there are students who have illness, who don't have a choice to go or not. You can't force someone who is sick to do extracurricular activities. Forcing someone who has a disease or syndrome shouldn't be forced to do something that could make there condition worse then it already is. What if a student has something they don't know much about yet but they know something is wrong. You force them to be in the extracurricular activities and they get some type of bacteria or run and make everything in their system worse.

Lastly, forcing kids to do something has no impact on how they are going to feel about what is going on. Forcing kids to do things makes them want to do it less and dread what they are doing or going through. Such as forcing kids to do extracurricular activities is just making them not want to come because you can't let them pick on their own if they want to come or not. You should have kids have their say. Letting them like you and know what you are planning on doing could impact this situation a lot with just letting them have their own option.

Understanding now why kids shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities, the principle should not force these kids to do extracurricular activities. They should let the kids decide if they want to, they should figure out if their are any issues if they want to do it, and they should know if they are committed without being told to do it.
