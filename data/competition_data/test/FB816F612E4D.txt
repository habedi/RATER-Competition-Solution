I think this claim would be very usefull in a students environment. The resone I feel as why this facial action coding system would do well in schools is because. The student mind is very fragial and kids might be sad from being bullied and might not express how they feel. With this type of technaloge school can lower the risks of suicides or school shooting by trying to help the child in any way they can. And also can stop kids that bully eachother or can even provent harmful perents at the childs home. It is sad to hear that one of your fello class mates has just commeted suicide. And me of all SCHOOL_NAME students should know how that feels and if there was something that have could provented that I would have done everything in my will to. one of my close friends dies 1/1/2018 from commeting suicide #lilpesoworld #neverforgotten #alwaysinourhearts
