Do you want to be a cowboy?

Have you ever heard of a Seagoing Cowboy? Well, a Seagoing Cowboys is the best kind of cowboy there is. When you're a Seagoing Cowboy you take care of horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped to places in the world that were left in ruins from World War ll. The cool part is that you get to go across seas and you also have time to go sightseeing. But it feels great to help people as well.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you have great responsibility. Yess it sounds like a fun getaway, but you also have to fed and water the animals at least two times a day. We also get to clean all those messy stalls, but you learn to be responsible which is important.

After you get to your destination you can go sightseeing. I got to see Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water by the way. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

On return trips after the animals have been unloaded is when you have fun on boared. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals have been. Table-tennis touraments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also help pass the time.

So if you want to be a cowboy you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. Not only do you learn about how to be responsible you also get to see the world and have fun with your other fellow cowboys. Most importantly, you help people which makes you feel good!
