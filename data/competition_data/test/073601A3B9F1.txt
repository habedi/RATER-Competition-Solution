You wonder if Venus could be explored? Well we could one day. I think we could explore Venus. These things can help us to reach that goal is mechanical computers, allow scienists to float above the plant surface, silicon carbide, and other inovations.

One way is using mechanical computers. mechcanical computers don't have to use modern technogoly in them. In the text it says, "but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all." Then it says, "systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." This tells us that the mechanical computers are resisent twards Venus's harsh enviroment.

Then another way is sending scape craft to hover around venus, so that sciencetists who are studying Venus would be space.

In the text it says, "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape." Then it states says again' "a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. " This tells you that the sciencetists would be safe and sound in the ship while they are studying Venus.

Then another way is to make materials that would survive the Venus's terrian. One material would be silicon carbide. In the text is says, "some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of VenusÂ’s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." then the text says, "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." This tells us that silicon carbate would survive on Venus's terrian and other inovatoins.

In conclusion humanity will go to Venus at some point in time, but with the proper tools and edicatoin. I still think we cen explore mars. well do you still think we can go to Venus?
