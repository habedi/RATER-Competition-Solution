The face would be a landform unless the alien went underground and somehow had it's face onto the outer landscape. Because of the red planets lanform their might've been a very bad storm and somehow created a face in the ground. Scientist believed that it was just another Martian Mesa, close to Cydonia but, the scientist had discovered that the faces had unusall shadows that made it look like Eygptian Pharaoh. Days later scientist discovered a unveiled image for all to see with a caption that said huge rock formation that resembles to a human head. Scientist had took more pictures to get more information and they discovered that their photo had looked exacally like the vikings photo they took in 1976 so that gave scientist ideas of what they had on their hands. Scientist also thought that the photo was Martian Equvalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. Garvin stated that the lava dome takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face as on mars thiis statement gives second thoughts of what scientist discovered. No one really knew what it could be but they waren't going to stop until they came up with a conclusion so they would need more evidence more information and they needed to analyze their statements to come into conclusion.
