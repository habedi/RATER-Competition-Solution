I'm going to tell you why you should join or why you should't join the program. I'll be giving my reason and also Luke's reasons to support my claim. I will be arguing on why others should join the program.

Others should join the program because you get to travel around the world. Luke stated that he went to China and Europe! He traveled the Pacific and Atlantis ocean several times. He's been to Greece. If you like to travel, this would be a great program to join.

Luke feeds and waters the animals. Luke has to check on the animals every hour. I would join this program because I'm an animal person and I would love to spend weeks, maybe even months with these animals. Others who aren't animal people maybe shouldn't join this program. It would be a great way to interact with the animals if you don't like animals al that much.

Joining this program could teach you something. It could teach you many things. It could teach you to be more cautious about things. As Luke stated "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." This program can make you more grateful for everything. It could make you work harder instead of being lazy. You could actually get things done if you were to join this program. That is why I think you should join.
