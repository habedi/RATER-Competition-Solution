Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these Summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? One may believe that the students should be able to design their own projects rather than the teacher do it for them. This way, students are more likely to complete the project, there is a higher chance that they will understand it, and it gives them an opportunity to be creative and overall learn more.

Letting students design their own projects holds a higher chance of them actually completing it. If the teachers were to design the project the students may not like the topic causing them to not try hard, or worse, not complete it. Most may believe that students should be able to choose a topic they actually agree with, instead of being forced to do as their teachers say.

If students choose the design of their projects there is a more likely chance of them understanding it. Some teachers have a habit of choosing confusing topics for their students to do projects on. Students will most likely not do too great of a job on a topic they do not have the least amount of knowledge about. Students have more of an understanding of what they know then their teachers do.

Allowing students to choose the design of their projects gives them an opportunity to be creative and overall learn more. If the student chooses their own topic it gives them a chance to learn more about a topic they are already interested in. Without having rules set by teachers, they can be creative about the way they set up their project. Creativity is a big part of the learning process.

On the other hand, some may believe that teachers would do a better job at designing the project, because they could choose a topic their students know nothing about so they will learn more, although, others may not agree with this opinion. In conclusion, students being more likely to understand, students actually completing their work, and students having the opportunity to be creative and learn more are all the reasons one might need to give students the choice to design their own project.
