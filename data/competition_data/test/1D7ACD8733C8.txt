In " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that Venus represents.

In the text it gives multiple reasons that Venus is dangerouse. Venus cann be a dnager to things that go on in space and the diffrent things that happen in space.

In the text it states that " Venus is the closet planet to earth in terms of density and size" This is stating that venus is the closet planet to earth so if something happpens to Venus then it couold effecct earth. In the text it says " A thick Atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus." When iI think of that statement it scares me. The reasont the statement above scares me is because th4e carbon dioxide that is on Venus could coem to earth and start puliting the air. Pullution in the air is not good for our animals or hummans.

I feel liek the author did a very good job at explaining why it is a good idea that studying Venus is a worthy despute inspite the dangers of studying Venus. I feel like the author could probablly give more backround on why it is not very safe to study Venus. I feel like the author could give more information why it is a good idea to prsue studying Venus.

In conculson i feel like the author did a good job suggesting that studying venus in the artical " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is a worthy prsuit despite the dangers that studying Venus might have. I feel like the author also needs to include more facts about Venus and making it more intresting for the reader.
