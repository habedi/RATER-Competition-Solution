Some schools allow students to complete classes online or through video conferencing from home as an alternative to being on campus. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because this leaves optimal room for cheating, this could cause students to lack social skills, and this is an open opportunity for procrastination.

Having access to a computer or a cell phone is an advantage in the new technology-based generation. However, this leaves a place for dishonesty in work when used for in-home learning. Using the internet, you can access absolutely any information with a few clicks or taps. Websites such as 'Brainly' and 'Quizlet' are used by students seeking answers; they type in a question from their work and every answer for all of the questions is right there in their hand. With cheating instead of actually learning and retaining knowledge, students will fall behind in the real world. In a classroom, most likely you will find that cell phone use is prohibited due to the fact that students don't use their phones for learning purposes. When students are guided by teachers instead of given the answers by computer, they are more likely to remember the information later in life.

Students who work from home are not around their fellow classmates. Being isolated from people is one way children and teens can lack social skills that they will most likely need now or as an adult. In a classroom, you are surrounded by other people your age, and you all can learn from each other. Classrooms are one of the first places where you learn how to communicate and collaborate with others. These are only a few of the social skills you could lack from being alone every single day. These skills are needed for getting jobs when you are older and for many other opportunities in life.

Working from home is a plus for getting to sleep in every day and being allowed to work at your own pace, but some students could take advantage of this and procrastinate. As i stated before, in this technology-based generation, a cell phone is a good thing to have. However, that could also serve as a distraction. Instead of being in the classroom where students are required by their teacher to complete tasks daily, they are in the comfort of their own home free to do what they want to do. Watching television,Â talking on the phone, skipping work days, and oversleeping can all lead to falling behind in work and receiving failing grades. When you have a teacher pushing you to complete each task when it is assigned, you are more than likely to complete all tasks given to you on time. This way, you will keep up your grades while also learning a sense of responsibility.

In conclusion, students would benefit more from learning in a classroom than they would from working at home. They won't be able to cheat on their work as easily as they could from home, they will have good communication skills from being surrounded by their fellow classmates, and they are less likely to procrastinate their assignments.
