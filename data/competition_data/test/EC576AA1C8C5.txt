The principal wants all the students to do at least one extracurricular activity. Why do you think he wants the kids to do more activities?

I agree because, he wants the students to do more activities because most of the kids in the world are little scared. they are scared of not being good enough for the middle school teams or high school teams. That is the reason kids do not want to do more activities. When they do activities that they like, they are going to want get better at that activity and they are going to want to do other activities.

The kids that are not doing activities, they are partying or sitting at home playing video games all day long. When you learn how to do activities you can make money by working and you can get better grades. So thats the reason the principal wants them to do more activities. If you are doing good activities, then you learn that working hard can get you far in life.

When you do activities, you get better at alot of things so you can become more confident to do other activities like the principal asked.
