The author does an excellent job of supporting his idea by giving us information like the temperature, physical structures, and the weather that occurs there. GIving us many reason why it's to challenging to go to Venus. There is multiple challenges would have to face in order to be on Venus.

One challenge would be the temperature that Venus may reach to which is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Which the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. " These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." Like it said in the passage it is way to extreme for humans to be on Venus because of it's high temperatures.

Another challenge you may come across is the weather and other physical behaviors. In the passage for example it said, " Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes,and frequant lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface." That would be a tough challenge because you would have to land on Venus and then you would have to be prepared for the behaviors of the planet and its weather. Which you would need some equipment and tools to figure out how to successfully accomplish the challenge and being able to survive.

A third challenge you may come across is making the right spacecraft, try to make it a safe trip to Venus , and making a good landing. Just being able to be on the planet for a good amount of time. In the passage it said, "Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner- in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned , and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." You have to be able to put a lot of work and close detail to make the spacecraft safe and just having some access to some of the tools or materials that would have to be used for the spacecraft.

In general the challenge of exploring Venus is massive. You may find a whole bunch of mini challenges to discover another challenge. It may take a long time, dedication, and effort to explore Venus but it may just happen.
