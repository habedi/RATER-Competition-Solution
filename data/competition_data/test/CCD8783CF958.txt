"Hurry up Don!", yelled Luke . Don came out to the deck . "We're almost at the station.", said Don . "Then I guess we have to to hurry up if we want poeple to join the Seagoing Cowboys program." said Luke excited. When the ship finally arrived Luke and Don went out to get a quick snack, and while at it convincing other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

As soon as luke and Don found a place to get a quick snack both had a bit of an issue. Both Luke and Don we're on the other side of the room becasue of all the poeple in there. "It's full in here. A million poeple must be in here!" ,yelled Luke . Don heard luke's joke but thought that it wasn't very funny. Don yelled "We should start convining poeple to join the Seagoing Cowboys program." Luke Shouted "Yes I think we should. "

Both Luke and Don had not been quite lucky .Only three poeple wanted to join . " We should try another time. " ,said Luke . The men that wanted to join , signed up and got the job. " We're going to reach land in a couple of days.", said Luke "Well for now we work hard on our jobs right now." , said Don . The crew had a meeting that the Seagoing Cowboys we're running low on men. All have either died or had retried.

When Luke arrived at the Station, Luke couldn't wait any longer for Don so Luke left him behind . Luke was determined to get more men on the crew. Luke went to lots and different places. Today Luke felt luckier now that he was carring a rabbit's foot for luck with him. I must get lots of poeple on the Seagoing Cowboys program. At the end of the Day,Don was desperteand worried for Luke if he was or wasn't going to make it on time. The boat was leaving Luke shouted that he found lots of poeple that wanted to join .

From that day and on the crew was careful and cautious. And had dozens more poeple wanted to join because war was happing again.
