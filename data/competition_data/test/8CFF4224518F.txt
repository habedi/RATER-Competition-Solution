In this article the author is supporting his idea about the studies of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In the article the author gives reason and evidence why. There is a posiblity to live on Venus, but still too dangerous.

Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it may well once been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4 it says "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains,and craters." There is even a posibility that Venus was largely covered with oceans and could have supported various form of life just like Earth. Venus can be a possibility of Earth travels. The dangers of Venus is the 97% carbon dioxide on the planet. In paragraph 3 it says " Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." Venus atmosphere is more dangerous than ours, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in our on planet. Can Venus be a planet we live on?

To get an understandment of Venus NASA need to get close and personal despite the risk. In paragraph 6 it says " Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. " NASA is working on different approaches. One example they gave in the article is some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This have been tested in a chamber simulating on Venus surface, and lasted three weeks.

Our travels shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation, like the author says in paragraph 8. At least try if there is a possiblity.
