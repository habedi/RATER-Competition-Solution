To: The Principal

I think that would be a bad idea ,because most students have a C average on their report cards. That would leave a lot of people missing out on connections such as physical education. Their wouldn't be any one on any of the school sports like football, basketball, lady basketball, baseball, wrestling, and track. If you were to do this that would mean we would have to cancel sports because of the lack of members. Most average students a least get one C on their reports. I think this policy should be changed because it wasn't well thought out idea.

Parents will complain and demand that their child should play in a after school sport or activity. Even when you would get a C average it means your barely passing. This should tell most of the players to get their average right ,and stop getting low grades. If that works then students will realize that if they want to participate in any kind of activities they should get on the right track. Even if you still decide to do this wait for two more reports an maybe you'll see the difference it makes to wait.
