i think the author did a very good job on explanning his oppion, after reading The Chellenge of Exploring Venus. The reason why I think this is because he did so much reasearch on Venus. He told me how it is the most similuar planet to earth and the closer one to us to. He let me now that it is a very hot planet and could potentially be a hot planet, But by telling me all this it made me want to ask a question weather we could eventually expand humanity to a different planet. Sure enough he answered that questions for me. Its like he ws answering my question before i got to. He made it sound like we deffently need to explore Venus but one of the causes is that he said was safety, they havent sent another space craft down there because they wouldnt come back maybe later on in the future they might but as in right now they send little things up tthere. by reading this he made me think that venus would be woth exploring. Based on all this imformation this is why i thought that he explained his claim very well.
