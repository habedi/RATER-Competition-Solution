In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author explaines all the dangers of Venus and how to over come them. He gives you good evidence on how you could explore our sister planet without suffering the harsh weather of Venus's surface. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, and it may have even had large oceans long ago, but today Venus's surface is inhospitable for humans.

The author states that "Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." Venus is no longer Earth-like, its surface temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times the pressure we experiance on Earth. And with that, there are many other factors making Venus inhabitable for humans. The author did offer a solution to these dangers, which would allow the scientists to float above the dangers. NASA said they would take a "...blimp-like vehical [that hovers] 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape." It would make the conditions survivable for humans, but how much research could you do on the planet when you're 30 miles above the surface? The author goes on and writes that researchers are working on machines that could possibly go in the ground of Venus and collect data about the surface,and could return it to the scientists for them to study.

The author of

"The Challenges of Exploring Venus," supports their idea that studying Venus is worth the risks. They take in account all the dangers Venus has to offer, and they come up with a solution that would make the planet explorable.
