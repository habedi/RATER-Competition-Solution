From what I understand, people are starting to use cars less and less.

Limited car usage has been seen in many different areas of the world recently and will continue to be seen in the near future. The green house gasses released from passenger cars is a tremendous harm to the ozone layer of our Earth. If one day a year we had a "No Car Day" then there would be a huge impact on the ozone layers.

Now I'm not suggesting that we just get rid of cars altogether, I love driving my car around, not just to get from point A to point B, but because of the freedom. Aside from that, cars are an essential for some people, like point A to point B for example. But, people that don't need to drive on a regular basis could get rid of their car and take the bus, or carpool. So there is always another option for transportation, I like to call it AT (Alternate Transportation).

If for one day of the year we had a "No Car Day" the ozone impact would be positively tremendous. Then people would also realize, "Hey, I have other ways of transportation like a bike, walking, or something else.", then there would be no problem with green house gasses guarenteed.

Now I know I haven't said a whole lot to make this sound good and all, but I do believe the percentage of people getting their drivers license is declining. My cousins in Texas feel they have no need for their license, when they always have someone to carpool them, or their parents just take them, or the city bus. Me on the other hand, I have a job, go to school, and I'm an active Boy Scout that helps with transportation on campouts throughout the year, it all depends on your circumstances on whether driving is appropriate for you.

Driving is an activity that many people do on a daily basis, but do they need to drive on that daily basis? Could they help towards a cleaner environment by finding alternate transportation? Or is a "No Car Day" in need? All of the above in my opinion. It all depends on your circumstance.
