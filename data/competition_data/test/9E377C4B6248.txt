In this generation everyone has a phone. I got my first phone when I was in 8th grade and since then I've just been on it probably 24/7.

When I got old enough my parents were really scared in letting me drive because they really thought I was going to text and drive. And the only fault that I could point to is this generation. There are 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. I promise you if you go outside right now you will see at least one out of every 2 cars texting and driving. Teenagers just think it's cool until sadly they learn the hard way.

To start everything, I just would like to say that I do not agree with texting and driving. Teenagers driving and texting literally, leads to nothing good. With us being teenage drivers, we are automatically easily distracted. Now imagine how our bodies react when we hear that "ding" that we get a message from a boyfriend / girlfriend. Your body just reacts in a way I can't describe and it's like you HAVE to answer. Then with you answering you get distracted and that means you're not paying attention to the road and/or your surroundings. And the rest isn't anything pretty to talk about.

What happens next isn't anything pretty to talk about. Like I said in my first paragraph nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from texting and driving. I've personally witness several accidents on my way to work. Some are worse than others but still, regardless of how "big or small" the accident is, ITS still an accident. Then in that spilt second you think to yourself and ask if that text was really truly worth it. There's a quote that I always remember when it comes to texting and driving, " it can wait" think about it , what would of happened if you did wait to text back? Maybe there would have been no accident, I guess no one will ever know because YOU chose to answer that text.

My final thought in this essay, is my personal experience. One day I was coming home from work and I was texting my girlfriend and I blinked and within that second I got into a car accident. I've never felt my heart beat that fast before, I was extremely scared in thinking if he was okay and if I was going to get my butt whooped. My other experience is my 3 friends who passed away last year. They were speeding along with some texting and sadly they all passed away. it was a very tragic year, leaning to live without them. And that's why I got all 3 of them tattooed on me. A reminder that im not suppose to text and drive.

That will conclude my essay but like I said , I DO NOT support texting and driving. Even blasting music and driving. Some people just don't understand that driving is not a game. Its something serious and with your actions you can ether kill someone or prevent from killing someone.
