Based on what I have read o do not think self riving cars should be allowed. The law is right based on what they say these cars eventhough they have sensos to make the driver aware of situations in need of a human. The person in the car may become to focused on what they are doing and ignore the sensor. The idea of self driven cars is too risky. Even though they are going for safety a car cant drive like a human or have the response time of a human and even computers make mistakes.

Even in a simple GPS they tend to make mistakes often. So what happens if the cars GPS is off on its calculations and the car drives through a house. Will they blame that on the driver. I would hope not. It shouldnt be the drivers mistake if the car messes up. You cant always rely on computers.

So no I highly disagree with this. Computers arent perfect, and there are just some things only humans can do. Driving might just be one of those things. What these people are visualizing are just things they have seen on t. v that does not mean it will happen the same as it does on t. v.
