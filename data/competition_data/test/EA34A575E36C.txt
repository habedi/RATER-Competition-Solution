The driveless car is a great invention. I perosinally think there should me more driveless cars made through out the years of the coming of age. The car still would be drivable but it would be very dependent on the human to stll pay close attention. In the article it states " This means the human driere must remain alert and ready to take over when the sitaution requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs." It telling us that the car may be able to function on its own but in reality it's really a normal car with special car features. I think driveless cars can make an impact on the world in a postive way.

It's probably going to be hard trying to win the govemernt approval because there is nothing wrong with the everyday cars be drive them selves. " As a result in most states it is illegal even to test a computer-driven car I think it's a safety matter but also feel if the location was secrure it should be okay. It going to take time for the driveless cars to actually be invented but overtime I think there is light at the end of the tunnel.
