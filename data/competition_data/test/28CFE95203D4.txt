I think teacher designed projects are fantastic. Schools should require teacher- designed project because teachers have more experience and know more about knowledge than students, students will learn more, and there grades will look awesome.

Firstly, students will learn more from teacher designed projects. Students can learn new things just by the projects and different things. The projects are going to make things easier for the students. Also Teachers have more experience with projects and they know if one of there students is struggling on something she or he can put it on there project so they can do better on what there struggling on.

Secondly, students grades will look so much better then before with the projects. The more students do there project the higher there grade goes. Also teacher designed project can help you if you need extra credit and need to bump that grade up. Teacher designed projects are also good for summer break if grades are bad and you need to pass the class. Teacher designs projects are great for your grades.

Thirdly, the projects can help students with there knowledge. If students do more projects there learning skills will grow. Students will have all this new information stored in there brain and when a test comes up they'll remember everything they learned and score really outstanding on there test. The teacher designed projects will help all year long.

Teacher designed projects can be really useful to students. They can help you with mostly everything the project will help bring your grades up, learn new things, and make you smart. Thats why i require teacher designed projects in schools.
