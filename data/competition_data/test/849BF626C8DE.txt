Here are a few reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboy.

Why you should join if you join you help the world and its places recover. What I mean by that is at the time world war 2 ended. And different countrys including us were left in ruins. Along with helping the world reshape you can visit places you never been before. Meet new people but do forget the the world isn't always fun it's still a dangarous job but don' let that drag you down.

According to luke it does take some geting used to in paragraph 7 luke fell down a latter when it was raining. He cracked some ribs and nearly fell from the boat. But don't get scared being a seagoing cowboy isn't all work. There are time when you can relax and play sports. In the room were you'd carry animals in.

But in the end it up to you do you wnat to take that small risk and be a seagoing cowboy or not.
