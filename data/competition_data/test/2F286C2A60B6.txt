Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I believe it would be a great idea to require all students to perform community service, doing this would cause our community and the world to be a better place.

For example, if just a mere 25 students would help pick up trash around SCHOOL_NAME everyday, our community would be so much cleaner.

And, if our community is that much cleaner, the more likely less birds would tragically die due to mistakenly eaten trash, and less sea life would die from being suffocated from plastic bags and six pack can holders.

If older or more educated students were willing to tutor, or mentor younger or less educated students, then our school and community might all just be a bit smarter.

In this case, it would help out the teachers as well as the parents. Not everyone can necessarily afford a Math, English, History, or Science tutor.

So, if a more educated student is willing to help out that could keep from kids failing tests, not turning in homework, and maybe even passing a class.

If more SCHOOL_NAME students helped feed homeless families, build houses in Mexico, or maybe even just read a book to a younger child who can't read, this community would be better!

Some people need food, some need a place to live, and some might just want a story read to them.

But all of this is counted as community service.

ALL of it helps our community, and makes it a better place.

In conclusion, if you require all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME to perform a certain number of community service hours, our community WILL be a better place. I can promise that.

Community service is a very important thing, it helps the community and can even change the world. Simply one person can make a HUGE difference on this planet.

Imagine how big of a difference 1,300 students can make.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
