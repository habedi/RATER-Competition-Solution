ESSAY

AUTOMIBILES ARE THE LINCHPIN OF  SUBURBS, WHREMIDDLE- CLASS FAMILIES FROM CHICAGO TO SHANGHAI TEND  TO MAKE THEIR  HOMES. AND THAT EXPERTS  SAY, IS A HUGE IMPEDIMENT TO CURRENT  EFFORTS TO DRASTICALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM TAILPIPES... PASSENGER CARS ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR 12 PERCENT  OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN EUROPE... AND UP TO 50 PERCENT IN SOME CAR-INTENSIVE AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES.

ACCORDING TO THE TEXT, IT WAS THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR CARS HAVE BENNED WITH ONLY BUSES AND CARS IN THIS CAIPITAL CITY OF 7 MILLION. THE GOAL IS TO PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION AND REDUCE SMOG. MANY COMPANIES  CREATE CAR TO  RESUDE GAS EMISSIONS FOR THE CARS .

BUT AMERICANS LOVE AFFAIR WITH ITS VEHICLES SEEMS  TO BE COOLING. WHEN ADJUSTED FOR POPULATION GROWTH, THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN IN THE UNITED STATED STATES PEAKED IN 2005 AND DROPPED STEADILY THEREAFTER, ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS BY DOUG SHORTS OF ADIVISOR PERPESCTIVES, AN INVESTMENT RESEARCH COMPANY.PART  OF THE EXPLANATION CERTAINLY LIES IN THE RECESSION, BECAUSE CASH-STRAPPED AMERICANS COULD  NOT EFFORD  NEW CARS, AND THE UNEMPLOYED WEREN'T GOING TO WORK ANYWAY.

IF THE PATTERNPERSISTS- AND MANY SOCIOLOGISTS BELIVE IT WILL-IT  WILL HAVE BENEFICIALS IMPLICATIONS FOR CARBON  EMISSIONS AND THE EVIROMENT, SINCE TRANSPORTATION IS THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF AMERICAN'S EMISSIONS, JUST BEHIND POWER PLANTS. BUT IT CULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CAR INDUSTRY.

EXAMPLE FROM THE TEXT: HE  AND SHE  HAVE SIMILIAR OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THEIR CHILDRENS.THEY [19 AND 21] HAVE  NOT BOTHERED TO GET GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE, EVEN THOUUGH THEY BOTH LIVE IN PLACES WHERE ONE  COULD COME IN HANDY, THEY ARE INTERESTED, BUT IT'S NOT A PRIORITY. THEY ORGANIZE THEIR SUMMER JOBS AND SOCIAL LIFE AROUND WHERE THEY CAN WALK OR TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR CAR-POOL WITH FRIENDS.ALSO WHETHER MENBERS OF THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION WILL STARS BUYING MORE CARS ONCE THEY HAVE KIDS TO TAKE TO SOCCER PRACTICE AND SCHOOL PLAYS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. BUT SUCH PROJECTIONS,EVEN IF CAR BUYERS ARE MERELY OLDER OR BUYING FEWER CARS IN LIFETIME RATHER THAN REJECTING CAR CULTURE.

IN CONCLUSION

THE CAR IS USE  FOR MANY RESONS , MANY PEOPLE USE LIKE A TRANSPORT MANY COMPNY CREATE CARS THAT HELP ENVIVEROMENT.
