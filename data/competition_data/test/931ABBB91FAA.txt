Dear principal,

You should not change the policy for sports be a B average to play. This is because most of the kids get a C average and wouldn't be able to play. When some of these kids are trying their hardest and can't get a B. Also some of them would love to play. Another reason is a C isn't bad it is average and most probably get a B or even an A. Also just because they have a bad report card doesn't mean they have a bad personality or won't work hard. Some kids that have an A act worse then some that get a C. Another thing is because some of the students that get Cs is because maybe they aren't good test takers or got bad home work grades and couldn't bring it up any higher. Also they may of just not get the unit for that day quarter. So please don't change the policy and let kids with a C average play a sport or do an activity. The kids need exercise and a place to be a part of something.
