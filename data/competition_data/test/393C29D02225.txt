Do you know what Sea Cowboy is? Well its alot of fun. You should become one just like me. You get to see cool places all around the world, your helping the world, and you will meet lots of new people from different areas of the world. This is a great chance for all people, even teenagers. You will ride a boat with a captain all over the world.

You get to see cool places all around the world like China and Europe. You can explore them too. There are also cool activities you can do in these countries. For example, you could eat there type of food,or go sight seeing, trust me its beautiful. There are lots of things to do when you've arrived at a different country. This is a life changing experience that you might not get a chance to do. This might be your only chance to be a Sea Cowboy.

Your helping the world a bunch by giving other countries horses that they might not have because of a war or natural causes and so on. This helps you become a better person and it helps other countries and the people your giving the horses to. This helps everyone in that country because they might not have a car and there horse died ,and that was there only transpertation and they don't have any horses left that they can buy. If we give them horses, now that family has transpertation again. So this will help others and yourself.

You would meet lots of new people in these countries and you meet your crew. You meet Chinese and Eurpeon people and more. You would learn new languages from all over the world. You could learn lots of things from the people in other countries. For example you could learn there culture and what type of food they eat or even there style of houses. This will stay with you forever in memory. It will be one of the most fun experience you'll ever think about. These people can tell you about there life and what they have been through.

This was surely fun for me but I sadly will have to move on next year. I now that if you do this, you'll be sad when you have to move on too. But you'll remember all the cool places, how you help different countries in the world, and how you meet all those nice people and talked about there background. Trust me this was a experience of a life time. That I and you, would never forget.
