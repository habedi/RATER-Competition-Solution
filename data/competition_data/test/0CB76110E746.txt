Pollution is a pestering problem worldwide and the biggest investor to this type of un-seen pollution is the automobile. wich can account for the first explanation why there several advantages for reducing and limiting the amount of car usage ,first to reduce emmissions, pollution and greenhouse gases. secondly being that there is plenty of other more peaceful means of commuting to where you are getting to.

To thrust this arguement forward that limitng car and automobile usage will have significant advantages over the world wide pollution problem is the first evidential excerpt in source four paragraph thirty four it quotes "it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largest source of americas emissions just behind power plants" this section implies that cutting down are vehicle and transportive uses will benficially affect or pollution and emissions problem cutting it down drastically. the second jerking piece of evidence is that in source two paragraph ten states that after days of near record pollution paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. this goes to prove that drivng , cars , and automobiles can significantly have a huge impact positively for our pollution and has contributed so much that we have pollutio almost like never before.

Another reason for needing car usage limited is that it will lead to a better life. in paragraph 24 it states that this is a good oppurtinity to take away stress. what this means to imply is that by taking away the stress using this method it will lead to a better more peaceful life as stated in the original claim. A secondary source of evidence is in paragraph 28 when it say parks and sports centers also have bloomed . these kinds of things happening because of the lack of car usage can sometimes make peoples life more fun and when life becomes fun life can beocme better demonstrating that the lack of car usage can implant in most people, a better life.

whether life becomesÂ  better or pollution goes there is a wide range of advantages to cutting our vehicle and motor usage to a minimum.
