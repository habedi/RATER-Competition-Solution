In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," NASA finds a rock on Mars that looks like a human face. When people first see this they go crazy and jump to conclusions saying it's an alien. When I say going crazy I mean that they put this rock face in all kinds of movies and magazines. The people later find out, it's not an alien after all. After finding this out, people still find a way to believe that the face isn't a landform.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photo. This photo revealed a natural landform. The camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and people said alien markings were hidden in the haze. On April 8,2001, they got an even better picture of the rock. The picture shows the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landform common around the American West. "It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho," says Garvin. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion, the last picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken on a cloudless day and if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were. The first two pictures may not have been great but after the last picture that was taken, all evidence points to the face on Mars just being a landform and not an artifact of aliens. Also, the face is Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa, which is landforms common around the American West such as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the height of the Face on Mars. All real evidence leads us to the conclusion that the face on Mars is just a landform.
