There are many advantages to limting car usuage. Many places such as Vauban,Germany, Italy and Bogota,Colombia have done things to reduce the usuage of vehicles to better things out such as air pollution. So I'll tell you about the advantages of not using a car and how these places in the world are handiling a problem such as is.

To begin with, in place like Vauben, Germany where the streets are completly "car-free" generally don't allow street parking, driveways, and home garages. 70% of the Vauben people do not own car. People who live here tend to be generally happy without having to ride a car everyday and constantly needing one where ever they go. There has been attempts in the past two decades to make cities dencer and better for walking and whatnot. A place like Vauben may have been like the most "advanced" eperiment in the usuage of cars in life.

In addition to Vauben being a "car-free" place. Paris a completly different place where there's a lot of car usuage from what I know. After a near record breaking record. Paris had created a small driving ban. So they can clear the air and freshing it. Motorists with even numbered licence plates were made to leave their vehicles at home and if not they would suffer a 22 euro fine. I'd imagine that there would be a lot of people fined that day and there was... Almost 4,000 dummys were fined. Thankfully at the end, the smog had cleared enough on Monday. Even in United States they are trying to make "car reduced" communities. Which is a very good idea to me.

Lastley, there is many of these places that are doing these bans and making care free places but we don't have to do that, we can always limit ourselves on were
