Have you ever wondered why the Earth is so polluted? That is because so many cars are being driven and so many factories are being made. In some parts of Europe cars arent aloud to be driven its a car free zone. This is to help the Earth from all the pollution that is being caused all around us. Having so much pollution can kill our planet.

Many people around the world want to help our planet. Driving cars is easier but it is very bad for our plants and trees and for our own health. People in Colombia as said in source 3 are getting together and making this happened because they see th actual change behind all this. Some people might think this idea is crazy but it actual can work. We have over a billion cars driving around our Earth and all of that goes up to the air and we breath all of that and that makes our day look ugly and the Earth not look so pretty. Flowers have been growing faster after this idea was made natural air gives us strength.

In 2013 as said in source 4 they have investigated that Americans are driving less and getting less licenses. Driving less cars makes us live longer because we are not just sitting their in a car doing nothing we are actuve riding a bike or even walking. For those ong trips that take ours to get their we call a bus or a taxi and pay them to get their that is less cars and vehicles that are driving around hurting out planet. It is much better to have the world like this because you will see the population growing and people living longer and not passing away at an early age. Like this we dont breath that nasty air that cars let out and little kids dont have to breath it either like that when they grow up they will be strong and healthy.

A lot of people might think taht this idea is crazy but when they actual try it out they will start realizing how it well help our planet very much. When was th elast time you went out walking and then a car passes by you and all that gas air gets in your face? all of that air is very annoying and it gets you out of air right? well that is why its best to just walk everyone and if your really that lazy just call a taxi our a bus to pick you up.
