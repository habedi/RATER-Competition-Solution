Many students would love the idea of taking online classes from home, but I don't think that would work out in their favor. I believe that students who take online classes would not have as many benefits compared to students who physically attend school. I think that there are key factors that would benefit students who attend school physically, compared to the students who take online classes. I believe that school is a place designed for students to learn, concentrate, and develop new skills while home isn't the place for that.

Concentration plays a major role in how a student learns new material. Students can concentrate a lot more in an actual school compared to their own home. I think that home has many distractions for students which would play a big role in how focused they would be. For example, a distraction at home can be anything as simple as a students family members. Students who stay at home could very easily get distracted by their siblings, grandparents, or even pets if they have any. Another example of how a student could be distracted at home is that they would have all of their entertainment sources around them. Having things like TV or video games around them could easily tempt them in not completing all of their school work, so that they could go and do those other things that they would enjoy more. If students went to school physically instead of doing online courses from home however, then they would not have to deal with any of these problems.

Having a teacher present with you that can guide you through the material and answer any of your questions is a very valuable recourse to have. Students who take online classes from home however, would not have the same luxury that the students who attend school would have. The purpose of a teacher is to make a student feel as comfortable with the material as possible. Students who take online classes would probably have their own online guide or teacher, but it would not be the same as having a teacher physically present with you that could explain the material better than any online source. For example, if the student who is taking the online course has trouble with the material that they are learning and needs an explanation, having someone like a teacher give an explanation in person will help them understand it the most compared to any other source. That is why most people who need help either hire a tutor or go and see their teacher in person for extra help rather than going online to try and learn the material. Having a teacher physically present with you plays a major role in how well you will learn the material.

Going to a school physically will also prepare a student more for the rest of their life compared to them staying home and learning from online classes. Students who go to school physically will not only learn better, but they will create new relationships with people and will also learn how to work together with different people. Going to school physically helps a student get out of their comfort zone and also helps a student create skills that will help them out for the rest of their life. These type of skills can include physical and social skills. Students who take online classes from their home however, would not have the opportunity to create these skills and learn how to work together with other people. For example, if a student who attended school physically and a student who took online classes were asked to complete the same task such as doing an experiment that requires them to go outside and interact with other people, the student who went to school physically would most likely complete it faster and better because they would have more social skills and more experience that they got from going to school physically.

Ultimately, students who take online classes from home would not benefit more than students who attend their classes in school. Students who take online classes from home would not be able to concentrate any better, they wouldn't have as many learning resources with them, and they wouldn't be able to develop any key skills that would help them throughout their life. School is a place that is designed for students to learn, interact with each other, and concentrate, while home is not. Taking online classes from home won't give students the learning experience that they would get if they were to attend school physically. That is why I believe that students who physically attend school would have more benefits than the students who take online classes from home.   Â
