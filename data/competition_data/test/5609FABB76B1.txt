Ban Driverless Cars!

Ban driverless cars! Weather, We should have driverless cars or cars with drivers has been in a huge issue in the world today. Some people may believe we should have have driverless cars but, in this case I think we should ban them from the United States due to many reasons.

One reason why driverless cars should be banned because of reckless driving. Reckless driving is one of the major deaths we have in the world today. Having cars with no drivers can be very dangerous to the driver and passagers in the car, even the pedestrians on the streets and other cars. As the story states "... Lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."

If we allow driverless cars we never know for sure if it is actaully safe to drive them on the road and citzens wouldn't be safe.

Get rid of driverless driving!

Another reason we shouldnt have driverless cars because the cost for them would be too much. Today in the world technology has became very important to us . Driverless cars would have to have lots of technology to work. "such as radar sensors , and GPS receiver, motion sensors also" Driverless cars will cost alot more than a regular car that requires a driver.

If one of your sensors stop working it will cost alot more to get fixed than a regular car. Which also would mean your car would unsafe and undrivable.

Last but not least, my last reason is changing to laws. By having driverless cars require the laws to be changed. Eventually everyone would be forced to buy a driverless car do to the changes of the law. The laws would have to change and it wouldn't be fair to other people with regular cars.

In conclusion, Driverless cars should be banned. Due to safety issues, reckless driving, cost, and changing the laws. I do understand that people may disagree with my arugment but, here are reasons why I believe driverless cars should not be allowed.
