Dear,Fellow Scientist at NASA

I have heard you belive that there is a face on mars that was created by aliens... this is false. You may wonder why it is false? It's false, because with the new imaging system(Mar Global surveyor or MGS).We now have the ablity to see the surface of Mars with greater detail. Due to this the new images we found we can compare Cydonia to Earth physical features as well as the previous images. After a little time,we have found this feature on the surface of Mars to be almost the same as a butte or a mesa on Earth. Both of these land forms are found in the Western region of America. Dr. Garvin even stated,"It remind me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."and he also said,"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

This common mistake was possibly because of all the conspiracy theorists. As well as Hollywood making films or book or even magazines over the image. So it's no suprise even some of us made the mistaken that it's an Alien made object. I wonder have you seen the new images of Cydonia ?That may be a reason why you thought it was created by aliens,but in the image it shows a dried up river or a small valley that placed on a hill. So,it would be best to go look at it.

Just to remind you we have a meeting at noon over the image of Cydonia... again. So don't be late.

From,Your Co-worker
