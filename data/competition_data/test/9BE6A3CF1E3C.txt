The electoral college should not be used and the popular vote for the president should be in active

To begin with,the 'electoral college' is not fair. The people should vote for who they want and most popular vote wins.'under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president ,but for the slate of electorals, who turn elect for president' (paragraph 10 'whats wrong with the electoral college,)Citizens of america should vote for the their new leader. The slate should not then decide the election of the president.

To countine with, many problems can be caused with the electoral college.'the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisisin a century;the system allows for much worst .Considering that the state  legistarter are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.' (paragraph 11 'whats wrong with the eclectoral college.')the system had caused a big diaster in voting history do to the electoral vote. with the electoral vote people have then no choice but to blame the state considering that their the ones who are responsible for the voting.

To continue with another reason why it should not be used is because depending how big the state is (population) thats how many elecctoral votes they get. 'obama ,who won the vote,got 29 electoral votes' (paragraph 21 'big states') 'if you lived in texas, for instance, and you wanted to vote for for john kerry . on the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election,they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral vote' (paragraph 10 'whats wrong with electoral college') people should have all equal votes its not fair for rhode island to get less electoral votes then florida because its size. if the state of rhode island people vote for either party there vote should count as much as florida.

in conclusion the electoral college should not be in use and the popular vote for the president should be in active. because every citizin should have the right to vote for who they want to be their president.
