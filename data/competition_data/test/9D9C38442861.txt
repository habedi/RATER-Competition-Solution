Hi my name is Luke I am writing this letter to convince you that you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Us, Seagonig Cowboys, love to play games like Table Tenis, Baseball, Volleyball, cards, and may other games. We also have responcibilties like, Check on the animals every hour, Feed and water them.

If you join us on our Seagoing Cowboy trips I promis that you will have fun and learn new things every day. Like i said before we do have responcibilties around here. We could always use an extra hand with cleaning, feed, and watering the animals. Also it might just get you out of going to that dreadful army when you become of age.

In my time working as a Seagoing Cowboy I have been to a lot of places , and learend a lot of new things. If your like me and good at worken come join us. Remeber at the end it all pays off. Also we always are looking for new recrutes evey day. Once you join you will never want a different job.
