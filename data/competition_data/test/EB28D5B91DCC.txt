There have been many changes in the education system over the years. One of the most common things that has been implicated into the school systems is technology. There are many benefits to adding technology to your everyday learning experience. For one, it makes the idea of online classes a reality. Most teachers have started to use sites such as Google Classroom to upload recordings of their lectures for their students. This makes it easier for the students that were not in class that day to listen to the lecture and use what they heard to stay up to date in the class. Online classes benefit students in many ways that helps them with their education.

It is widely known that the amount of students that miss school due to being sick is a high number. This causes the student to miss some of the instruction that is given in class. With online classes and video conferencing, it makes it easier for the student to take time to recover at home while not missing too much of the lesson. This would also help students that are out of school for a longer period of time for other reasons. Being on homebound is one example. While someone on homebound is assigned a teacher to meet with to be given their assignments that they miss, it also is helpful to have some of the material online for the student to look over. This makes it easier when they meet with their teacher so that they know what questions to ask if they don't understand something that the material covered. Another helpful thing online classes offer is even if the student was in the class, it gives them another opportunity to look over the lesson and study if they didn't understand it the first time they went over it the first time. Most of the students are given a computer to use during the school year. This ensures that the student has a way to access online work. Many have found this to be very helpful if they are traveling during the school year. Using the computer lets them work on their classes no matter where they are. This also makes it easier for the teacher to give out work if some of their students aren't present the day they hand out material.

While there are many benefits to using online classes to help assist students, there are also many issues that come with using an online format. Some students have found that while there are some elements that they find helpful, it is not the same as physically being in the class. Not having a teacher present while working on the lessons has proven to be difficult for some. Most of the time, if a student has a question, they email the teacher and wait for their response. However, sometimes there is no way to continue the course without getting an answer to their question. If they attended the physical class, the teacher would be able to answer their question in person and make sure the student understood what they were talking about before they continued with their work. Many students like to work at their own pace. They enjoy the option to take their time to get their work done. Yet some students benefit from having a guideline and deadlines for assignments. If someone is known to procrastinate, online classes takes a lot of dedication and effort in order to complete the course. If the student finds themself to not be as motivated about finishing, it will take longer and they will find it very difficult to finish as the work piles up. Another thing that would hinder the student's progress is the social interaction aspect of the class. While some teachers find it helpful to split up certain people in the class that are known to distract others and themselves, being social is still very important for youth. If someone is using online classes every once in a while, this will not be an issue if they are still attending the regular in person classes. However, if someone is using the online classes for a longer period of time, this might lead to them becoming less and less social.

Online courses and video conferencing can be very beneficial towards students. It gives them the chance to stay up to date with the material that they might be missing if they are home sick from school. It also helps teachers when they are giving out work to their class. This leads to both parties being able to do their job and not cause work to pile up. More schools are starting to see the benefits of this and how well it works in keeping students on track. In the end, online classes are starting to help more and more students as time goes on.Â
