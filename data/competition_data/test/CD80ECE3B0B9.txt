Dear principal,

I think hat student should b allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time and im going to tell u why.

statistics shows that five out of every ten students have emergencies in school and might b embarrassed to tell any one about it and if they where allowed to use there phones during that free time they could call a parent or a close friend to come help out with the situation. Now i think that's better than having the whole entire school knowing about your business. Another reason is that a family issue could happen at anytime, don't you think that, that child should have some kind of communication with there family when this such thing does occur?

Also what if a student wasn't in class when the teacher assigned homework and it was to late for that student to go back to the class and see what the assignment was? They could easily pull out there phone and send a text to a friend asking what was assigned for homework instead of getting a zero on that particular assignment. Don't you think that if using phones during free periods to do this such thing would help bring up student grades?

Allowing student to use there cell phones during school hours may have its up's and down's. but on the bright side student wont become so bored with school and decide to skip classes to hang out on the streets during school hours. When you where a child didn't you wish that you could use your phone in school? If so u know how the student feel about this situation. I thank you for you for the time u took to read my letter and i hope to sit down and discuss this situation with you face to face. once again thank you!

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
