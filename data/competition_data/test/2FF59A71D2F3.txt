Hi, my name is Luke and I am a young man who got an opportunity to work on a cattle boat. I took this opportunity with pride, and did not regret it. Some jobs I had to do were feeding the cattle, cleaning the stalls, and being night watchman. These may seem a bit tough, but they are worth doing for the outcome. I did these jobs and went on to go on many adventures, like visiting places and meeting new people

"I'm grateful for the opportunity," I always say. I said this because I enjoyed this job and many people don't just get picked to have an opportunity like this. I feel that if you ever get the chance to go on a cattle boat, you should do it. Sure, there are some dangers over the seas, but sometimes in life you have to take chances. Maybe you are a young boy and you want something to do, this would be the perfect job for you! Do you feel bored or that you have no life... Well here you go! You get to travel the world with this job and work with other people! Does that not sound amazing? Just think, I got to visit China, Europe, Italy, and other plafces too! You will probably be able to visit more than me! If traveling the world and meeting new people is not good enough, I don't know what is.

In conclusion, my point of all of this was to persuade you to to try out the Seagoing Cowboys program and see if you like it. I feel that there are many great results that come after it, and I think that ifr you really put your mind to it, you would enjoy it. Please take into this into consideration and think about the possibilities of your future.

Thank You,

Luke
