Cars have become a huge part of a lot of peoples' lives. What they don't understand are the benefits and advantages of limiting car usage. Some of the advantages, such as reducing pollution, should be fairly obvious. However, some of the other advantages aren't so obvious. That's why people don't get rid of their cars. If drivers knew these benefits, they would most likely want to give up their car.

More specific benefits that fit in the category of helping the environment include the fact that up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions in parts of the United States are from passenger cars. (Rosenthal, Source 1) Researchers say that if the ownership of cars in the US continues to go down as it has been in recent years, there will be many "beneficial implications" for carbon emissions and the environment. (Rosenthal, Source 4) In fact, there was a one-day ban on a certain number of cars in France that cleared up a considerable amount of smog that had been in the city. (Duffer, Source 2)

Living without a car can also be calming. This has been shown numerous times. In Vauban Germany, a town without cars, one citizen said that "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." (Rosenthal, Source 1) A businessman from Bogota, Columbia, where they have an annual Day Without Cars, said that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." (Selksy, Source 3) As shown here, a person can have a much happier and healthier life from using their car less.

Another product of the Day Without Cars in Columbia is increasing business and opportunities for such. 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built. Bad, unkempt sidewalks have been replaced with newer and smoother sidewalks. Sports centers, shopping districts, restaurants, and parks have also been constructed. (Selsky, Source 3)

As stated here, limiting car usage has many advantages. It helps the environment, reduces stress, and helps development of communties and business. Additionally, it can help save time and improve safety. (Rosenthal, Source 4) It also reduces traffic, (Duffer, Source 2, and Rosenthal, Source 4) so those who decide to continue to use their car can also receive some benefits.
