We should use this technology for students in classrooms because it could tell if someone could need help more than others. This technology could be amazing in lots of classroom situations. Some students are sometimes confused and are too shy to ask for help, the teacher would exacly know with the student's emotional expression. This sort of technology is what we need to help so many students in their classroom, it could change the world!

This could help a teacher whether or not a student is being bored, so the teacher could make the lession more fun or enjoyable. In paragraph 6 it says,"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused for bored, Dr. Huang predicts." School could be a lot more educational with this, seeing how students and teachers use their emotions. The lession with this technology is helping everyone who is useing it, this could become really effective. Again in paragraph 6 after what I quoted it says,"then it could modify the lession, like an effective human instructor."

In conclusion having this type of technology is super helpful for everyone, classrooms would grow with diffrent kinds of learning. This would be really succesful with deaf people because maybe the person can't explain their emotions vividly. Also this could be another form of communication for them in the classroom, this is revolutionary. This sort of technology could be used in diffrent kinds of classes such as art, drama, speech, and even career classes. This is the reason why I think Facial Action Coding System could help out all kinds of classrooms around the world.
