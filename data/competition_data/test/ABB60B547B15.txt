I am against driverless cars , because they are not completely drive less. What the point of buying a driveless car when you still have to control the car in times. I am against them because when i hear these cars are driveless im thinking i could be texting or doing homework on the way to school. Then they say these cars dont exactly drive by them selfs so what the point of having a smart car?

Imagine all the new laws we would have to make. If these cars drive by themselfs and they crash whos fault is it? Whos really to blame for the car crashing the owner? Or the company? This would cause a big argument and take a lot of time to make new rules and laws. For example would we need a driver license, or whats the age limit to be in a smart car?

Another thing is this would probably cost a lot of money. How are the cars suppose to stop at the stop light ? Im thinking they would change all the stop lights to put a type of computer or sensor that the car can connect to. Just by doing that saying the car wouldnt have any more things we would have to upgarde it would cost a lot of money. Who will pay for these upgrades ? The car company or are they going to take it out of our taxes and make us pay? If that was the thing its just another reason why i dont agree with smart cars what if i dont have one and they are making me pay for all these things.

I pesonally dont think that smart cars are a good idea. For some of the reasons i stated and for many more.
