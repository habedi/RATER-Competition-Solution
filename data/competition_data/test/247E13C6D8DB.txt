Dear Principal,

I believe that you shouldn't let us bring our phones because it can start many problems. If a student loses their phones or if someone steals it we will have more problems. Most of the kids in the campus have a better chance of starting problems and other taunts. Kids without a phone can sped their time studying or helping others out. If you bring a phone to school the people who have a phone can communicate with people from the outside the campus and start problems. Kids can be calling other kids to start a fight or any other harassments. Teachers will have to scold kids during class if they forget to turn off their phones or if the kid doesn't care he or she will start texting in class. which will start more problems. The teacher will start complaining to you and then sooner or later you are going to ban the phones from our school.

Now if we don't have phones in our school it will give us time to study and catch up with our work. The teachers will have the kids attention, and they wont have to worry about phones ringing. we will also have time to socialize with other kids who need help with things or problems and we will have higher test scores, improvement in classes and better grades

The other reason why we shouldn't have phones is because the kid wouldn't have to worry about who's going to call or they wouldn't have any worries or distractions of what going to happen. Selfish kids might start dirty rumors or they will start taunting them with lies. In other words phones will start more problems and more bad behaviors towards each other. School without phones gives us a better campus and a cleaner behavior. They will pay a bit more a attention in class and will be kinder. If we have no phones you will have nor problems dealing with kids who cant grow up and act their age. Most kids will be better off without phones.
