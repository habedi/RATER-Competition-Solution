I dont feel that FACS is valuable it has lots of things that can go wrong with it. Its a computer trying to read a human by the muscles of that persons face. The muscles on someones face is just to unpredictable to be read by a computer to the exact amount of happiness or sadness ect. a humans face can have false emotion.

The human face can show false emotion. Say that you and your friend are at a fun event or are having a good time and you see someone you dont like so you give them a dirty look with a mad face your not really mad you still happy but you have to have a mad face towards the person your mad at. There are so many more examples just like that. The robot cant predict what you are actually feeling cause there is alot more emotion behind a smile.

There are things they can do to make the system plossible such as making a part that scans your brain. If they made a brain scan with this technology it would be way more accurate and be able to see inside your head and see how you actually feel. If they add this technology it would prabaly be used alot more by companies and sold by retailers cause its would be inovative and way more accurate, but until then its not good enough for me to be convinced.
