Wow!! I think that the principal should most definitely let students use their phones because first of all its really the students property so they should be able to use it when they have free time. Also if students are using their phones in an appropriate way then of course they should be able to use it. Lastly students should be able to use their cell phones because what if they're are trying to use it as like a calculator to help them with their math homework, or maybe they're just looking up how to spell a word if they don't have a dictionary.

First of all people cant really tell students that they cant use their cell phones if they have free time because its not their property its the students. Also if students are using their cell phones during free time or a study hall and its not distracting anybody or causing any attention to the student then why should a teacher or a staff member take or try to take something that doesn't belong to them. To me that's unfair and staff members don't have the right to take or try to take what does not belong to them.

On top of that if a student isn't in class or working on anything and uses their phone in an appropriate way then they shouldn't get their phone took or told to put away. Sometimes in class we even see teachers use their phone or get a call during class and answer it while they're teaching. I never knew that teachers could use their phones during class, and if they can then why cant we? To me that's unfair and cruel to all students who have cell phones.

The main thing that i don't understand about teachers or staff member s is when a student is using their phone for help with a school related subject or homework. what i mean is that some staff members don't care weather or not a student is using their phone for help because they think that they shouldn't need help if they were paying attention in class. what most teachers don't know is that every student is different and learns differently.

So now i think and I believe that the principal should allow students to use their cell phones because its the students property and staff members have no rite to take what is not there's, students use their phones in an appropriate way, and lastly some students use their phones to seek help with what they don't understand.
