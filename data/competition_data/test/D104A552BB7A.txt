Venus is a very interesting planet because it has many features like the Earth, but it is very dangerous to go to. Many are interested to see whats on it and wonder if it's a risk we should take to visit Venus.

Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is because it's the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys moutains an craters. Futhermore venus can sometime be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

Venus has many risks because Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. We can't get any rock,gas, or anything else, from a distance. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions are far more exxtreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.

Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because of the most forms of photography and videography ineffective. Scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

Despite all the risks for visiting Venus it'll be one heck of an accomplishment for being able to understand Venus and explore the planet Venus. Venus has many pros to visit for all the information for the future and knowing what can we do if it's so similar to the earth or maybe there is living organisms.
