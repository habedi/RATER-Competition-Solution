Over 10 million students signed up to take online classes at home last year. Sense the addition of online classes, the average IQ for high school students has decreased copiously. Taking online classes at home is the main cause for this, and this way of learning is turning the youth from ambitious, smart students to lazy, dumb kids. Furthermore, online classes do not help students as some people thought they would and there is a very good reason why. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students will decrease their social skills, students will receive negative health effects, and students will complete less work.

First off, students will decrease their social skills as a result from taking classes at home. Everyday at public schools students come in the building, and they instantly start chatting with their friends for almost the whole day. As a result, public school is a great way to make friends as there is always an opportunity to meet new people whether it is at lunch, for group project, or even in gym class. On the other hand, if someone were to take classes at home, the students would be stuck in their room for 6 hours not talking to anyone face to face. If someone were to sit in there room for the whole day for everyday of the school year, the person would start to get very lonely. Because of this, the student's social skills will suffer, and the student will soon become an isolationist. To finish off, online schools do not benefit students because it makes students less social.

Secondly, students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home because the students will receive negative health effects. As research states, the average person should only get two hours of screen time a day. If someone is taking online school at home, they will be staring into a screen for about six hours a day, which is 3 times the recommended amount. Furthermore, the results of siting in front of the screen can lead to visual problems, an increase risk of arthritis, and it will destroy your posture from slouching at a computer all day. A man named Generic_Name was always on his computer for at least 6 hours a day. The constant strain on his eyes gave him weekly migraines and he almost lost vision in one eye. On the other hand, when someone is taking online classes, gym is not always offered; Students will miss out on their daily exercise needed to maintain good health. To wrap it up, if you want to have good health, do not take classes at home.

Finally, students will complete less work if they take classes at home. For a student who attends public school, all students run on a strict schedule with late bells and teachers that enforces the rules, but at home no one is stopping someone from doing their work 3 hours later from when it is supposed to be due. Most students are procrastinators and will not be motivated to do their work. At that age their brain is not fully developed, so teenagers and below are not as responsible as a teacher who will tell students when to do their work. Also, at this day and age many of teenagers are glued to their phones, which will decrease work productivity. Many scientists have proven that distractions can almost double someones time to complete a task. In contrast, teachers have strict phone rules to limit distraction in the classroom. To summarize that up, students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home because they will get less work done.

In conclusion, online classes do not help students as some people thought they would and there is a very good reason why. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students will decrease their social skills, students will receive negative health effects, and students will complete less work. If someone wants to accelerate among their peers, the student should just take classes at public schools because they provide better, well rounded amount of education. To end it off, if someone wants to take online classwes at home, simply just tell them to stay in public school before they end up as a nonathletic, unintelligent delinquent.
