The author supports this idea of ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus '' by stating many facts by

In paragraph 3 it states that ''A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are accustomed to on earth. such an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface.

The main reason i used the following text was to support my point of view of why we do not go to venus. For example we do not go to venus because of the heat,carbondioxide,and the facors of the planet so in conclusion, i think it is important that we should be smart about this and only hoover above the surface. because of the factors of venus.
