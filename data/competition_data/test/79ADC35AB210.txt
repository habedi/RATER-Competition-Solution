Working on cattle boats are great, I believe that everybody should work on them And there are many good reasons why you should work on cattle boats And here are just some reasons.

One reason why working on a cattle boat would be you can help save farm animals. I'm not saying that farm animals would go completely extinct, but The population could go way down because of the war going on right know. Many countries were left to ruins so the animals would not have any food, shelter or even maby water.

Onother reason is that you Get to travel all around the world and get to see many different things. One time on my way to china I got to tour a excavated castle in Crete, and also marveled at the Panama Canal.

Also on the way back from trips when the animals were unloaded, we all found our times to have fun. We would play Baseball, volleyball games and many more exciting things that interested us on the way back wile we were not doing anything.

That is why I belive everybody should become a cattle worker, and my reasons why you should become one.
