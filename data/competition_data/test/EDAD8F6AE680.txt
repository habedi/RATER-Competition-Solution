Students should be able to bring cell phones to school for many different reasons. Like in case of an emergency or going to a friends house to call your mom before she gets worried or if you left home a important project or homework you can call home and tell your mom or dad to bring it to you.

Students should be able to bring cell phones in case of emergencies like your bus broke down in the middle of the road on a field trip and you can't get home. If you could bring a cell phone you could someone to come and pick you up and maybe your friend if he or she doesn't have a cell phone to call someone. Another reason is if you walk home and you go a different way and you get lost and need help getting home you can call your mom, dad or guardian to come and pick you up from where you are by directing them where you are over the phone. The final reason is if the power goes out at school and no one is at your house you can call your mom or dad to come home. That's some reasons why we should be able to bring cell phones to school.

Here's more reasons. Say you want to go over your friend's house and you and your friend decide to do it during the day and a few hours go by and you mom gets worried and starts panicing and you get in trouble when you get home you can call your mom if you had a cell phone and you wouldn't get in trouble. That's a reason why you should have a cell phone.

The last reason is if you aren't doing good in a class there is a big project worth more than half your grade and you need that project to pass, but you forgot it. With your cell phone you can call your house and have them drop it off and you do really good on it and you get a high average because of it.

Those are reasons why you should be able to bring cell phones to
