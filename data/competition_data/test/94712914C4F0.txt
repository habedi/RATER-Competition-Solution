Dear Principal,

The school policy has always stated that you can play sports or participate in activities, as long as you are passing every class. Many students are trying really hard to at least make a C average in every class, just because they are athletic and they want to play sports. The athletic students are the ones that usually struggle in school because they do not have as much time to study, because sports are so time consuming. The majority of the school makes a C average, changing the policy to having to make at least a B average is not going to make kids do better in school, it is just going to persuade the kids not to play school sports.

If you change the policy, volleyball, track, tennis, football, and many other sports will have less kids and a smaller chance of winning. Not only do most students try their best, but they also have to juggle all sorts of things. Sometimes school isn't always everyone's' top priority. Yes, school is important, but so is social skills and athletic skills. School already takes up most if every kids day, and now you expect it to take up more time by forcing them to make a higher grade? No child tries to fail and keep their grades low, therefore they are trying very hard in school, and now sports are going to get taken away from them.

How would you feel if your job was based on how high your IQ was, and if it was a certain number, you could not have a job? Most people would not be too pleased, and that is exactly how you are making all of the students at the school feel. Sports should focus mainly on your athletic skills, and school should focus on your mental skills. A child's mind doesn't determine their physical ability.

Sincerely,

A student.
