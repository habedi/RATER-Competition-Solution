Limiting car usage can be beneficial in many ways. For example, the air would be a lot less poluted if we reduced the amount of cars being used. In a German suburb that rarely ever uses cars, people report that it is less stressful to not own a car.

The advantages of limiting car usage is not only beneficial to people but also to the planet. If people were to limit their car suage, the amount of polution and smog in the air would be reduced and not be such an issue (Paris bans driving due to smog, P19).

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog (Paris bans drving due to smog, P14).

"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the glabal city." (Paris bans driving due to smog, P10). Regardless of the partial driving ban, almost 4,000 drivers were fined. This shows that some people do not really care about all the pollution they are bringing the Earth. Which gives people more reason not to limit car usage. If people are not going to try limiting downÂ  the usage, other poeple will follow that and not do so either. So limiting car usage is really important for the planet and for us.

The less cars we use the less smog there will be in the air.

Trying to limit car usage is not a new thing, the day without car is part of an improvement campaing that began in Bogota, Colombia in the mid 1990s (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P27). In Colombia, the rain did not stop the people from participating in the car-free day, and it had an effect in two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, which joined in the car-free day for the first time (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P25). So the car free day is rapidly making its way into cities, so that it can help limit the amount of cars being used.

Limiting car usage is very benefitial because it will also help keeping young people safe.

Researcher have found that drving between young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 (The end of car culture, P41). "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn" (The end of car culture, P33). "If the pattern persisits... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportaion is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants." (The end of culture, P34). If the usage of cars is reduced, people could be a lot happier than the are now. Since 2001, resarchers believe that young people do not make getting their licenses a priority anymore, which does improve the fact that people are getting a step closer to helping reduce the amount carbon in the air. If people could organize their schedual around being able to walk or take public transportation to the location they need to be at, there would be no need to use cars, to an extent of course. Not everyone can there their schedual to do that, but the more people that contribute to it the better.

"When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" says Heidrun Walter (Car free cities, P3). Limiting the amount of car usage will not only help to reduce the amount of carbon in the air, but it could also help the people live a happier life like Heidrun Walter. Although not everyone feels that way, whether people like it or not, it is better for them to reduce car usage not only for their sake but also for the worlds sake.

If car usage was to be limited, not only would the world be rid of more carbon, but it could also have a great impact on peoples lives.

"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commertial and public transporation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" (The end of car culture, P43).

Even though at the moment it is not the easiest task to get around, it would improve many things dealing with the environment, the economy, and the people.
