Learning in schools was considered a privilege at first and it eventually became common place to go to school. We have become so advanced in our technology that we don't actually have to be in the building to know what the teacher is saying or teaching.

A lot of people consider this a bane, but I think its more of a boon.

We have progressed a lot in the art of learning, but times have changed now we can learn without leaving the comfort of our homes. There are many upsides to this, for example: we may not have to get up as early depending on where you live.

However there are also many downsides to this new variation of learning too. It can be harder to pay attention with so many distractions around us, like TV for example. It can also be harder to understand or even hear what they are saying when you are on a screen, especially if you are having a hard time with a specific question. You also will eventually have to get up at a specific time to be able to actually attend the class. And you still have to be able to pay attention and stay awake.

On the other hand you don't have to look necessarily presentable (in other words you can just wear your pajamas). You can eat or drink whatever and whenever you want. You can also enjoy the comforts of your home without having to leave. Your also not as stressed to be late for class especially when class could be in your kitchen. There are many other upsides, but I'll just stick with this.

Another advantage is having even more kids attend the class with technology (then again that might overwhelm the teacher). Many children of the 21st century are addicted to technology, might as well use it to help them learn. Besides this is like a more advanced version of homeschooling. And if they learn from home (I think) they don't have to keep a whole bunch of papers in eight different stacks. In other words it would be easier to be organized.

If everybody wanted to learn from home I think it could really benefit a lot of people, namely people who don't want to go anywhere. As I said before, a lot of people consider this a bane, but I think its more of a boon.

If people really gave this new method of learning a chance I think it could really benefit the people who live to far away and don't want to miss school. A lot of people actually use this today, and I think its really benefiting them. So that is why I think we should really consider technological learning as an alternative option for education.
