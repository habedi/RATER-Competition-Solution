Dear Principal,

I believe it is not right for you to change the school policy. It is not right, and many students would agree. It isn't quite fair that you change the policy to where students are not able to play if their grades are not high enough. If a student has an average of a "C", that should be well enough. A "C" average is just as same as passing. A "B" would be asking too much in my opinion. Many students yes, are probably capable of an average of an "B" or higher but students shouldn't be forced to make that kind of average if they don't want to. And if you change the policy, you most probably will have less students participating in any sport events. If you don't have no students participating in extra curricular activities such as sports, your school will have no sprit. And what is a school with no sprit? Many of the students participating in sports or other activities are maintaining a "C" average. Students have other things going on for them in life, and if a student in your school has an average of a "C" its most probably because they are having a hard time in that subject. Maybe that student has taken the time to bring their "C" average up, but they just cant. When you have your sports, you want to and your in need to bring up your grades, but as long as you are passing your classes you are able to play. To most students sports are their everything. And maintaining a passing grade is good enough for them, because as long as they are passing the can play. Changing the school policy will not help your students, it will only bring more stress towards them. And having more stress towards your students will not help them to play well or play so hard in the games. If their game scores aren't good, what good is your school? You want to make a good impression on and for your school.

The better the impression, the better the students.

Sincerely from student's point of view.
