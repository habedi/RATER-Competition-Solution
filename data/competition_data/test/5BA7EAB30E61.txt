Students should be able to design their own school projects over the summer. Teachers have assigned all the work during the school year, so it'll be beneficial to the students in many ways if they design the project themselves. Especially when summer is for the students to relax, so them designing their own projects would be less stressful on them. It would give kids more incentive to complete it, it'll be completed more thoroughly, and it lets the student be mature and complete it all by themselves.

However, some people might think it's more beneficial for the teacher to design the projects. The teachers know exactly what information to give and it'll most likely be geared to what they will be learning the upcoming semester. The project will also be very uniform because they will have specific points they want you to cover and a rubric to which you have to meet all requirements. On the other hand, students will be much more motivated to complete it thoroughly because they have designed the entire thing by themselves.

First, this will give kids more incentive to actually complete the project. If the students get to design it themselves, it'll let them be creative which a lot of projects don't give. Even though the student is suppose to complete a project over the summer, doesn't mean that they will. No student wants to do a project thats cut and dry, if they are able to design it on their own it will give them more freedom and let them choose what they want to write about. They will also be able to collaborate with their friends and get ideas to make the project even more unique. If the kids actually get to do it all by themselves, they might actually want to do it and have fun while doing it.

Next, the project will be geared towards what the student enjoys. This will ensure that the project will be thorough with lots of detail and done correctly. Giving students the option to complete it themselves gives them creativity which most school related work does not give. The kids can pick posters, slide shows, pod casts, interviews, animated stories, and much more. Letting them pick how to portray it lets them complete it in whichever platform they enjoy the most, so the project will be full of information and very well done. Teachers sometimes don't understand students need to be creative because they are still kids, giving them this option would allow the students to use their strengths and complete a very impressive project.

Lastly, this gives students the opportunity to be mature and fill the role of the teacher. Students never get to design their own projects, usually they just follow a specific rubric the teacher gives and the project is cut and dry. Allowing kids to create their own project forces them to be mature because they'll have no teacher assistance and it'll be completely up to them from start to finish. Doing this prepares the students for college, where most work is done completely by yourself with little to no teacher help. Clearly the student will have guidelines, but all the information, platform, design, and formatting will be completely up for them to decide. This'll help mentally prepare the student for what college is like where you learn to mature very quickly.

Student designed projects over the summer will be more beneficial than teacher designed projects. Teachers would be surprised how detailed and impressive the projects would be if the students were left to their own devices. It gives the kids more incentive to do it, it'll be geared towards their interests so it'll be more thorough, and it allows the student to learn a level of maturity. Throughout the school year students don't get to design any work, so teachers should give kids an opportunity to complete a project by themselves.
