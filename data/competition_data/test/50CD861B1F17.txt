Limiting car usage can be an advantage for every city. While there have been efforts in the past who decades to make cities denser and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs.

As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city, Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline.

President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from incipient shift in America behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center said that differents things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the porcentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age.

In conclution it has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largeest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. It also has negative implications for the car industry but America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis.
