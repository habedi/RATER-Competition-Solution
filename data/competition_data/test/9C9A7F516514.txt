What I think about policy 1 is that it is good and bad because for the principle he would might think that it would make the teens safer for them to contact some one if their in some type of trouble, the bad thing about this is that the students will be more focused on their cell phones in class to check for a text message. Even if the school policy says turn off your cell phones they would not listen they would just say that they did turn off their phones, the trick for teens is that they would set their phone on silence or on vibrate. So personally i think the policy for getting rid of cell phones should not be a suggestion on the principle mind at all because how will we contact our parents or contact friends or even teacher so we know when our project or homework is due. The policy or the school district just think that we text for fun that is true but we also depend on it to keep tab's on what's going on with the school or when will the next pep rally began that's why it is so important to have phones in school we teens don't take it for granted, but for our safety in school or were ever we go and always have school information with us.
