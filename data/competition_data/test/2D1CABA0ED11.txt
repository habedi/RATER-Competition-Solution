On this article the way he explore venus. Sometimes venus is called by ''Eving Star'' is one of the bightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. I think that author have to many ideas and how was he experience on Venus he new the planet surface temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experience on our own planet.

For NASA this information is important to them and sand more people to vanus that they can keep getting information the value information to venus seems indisputable. On the paraghap 5 said that " solar power wound be plantiful and radiation wound not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions,but survivable for humans" this means that is danger that human keep going because venus don't have the same recurses that we have on the Earth howevr, peering from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate thye dense atmosphere, rendering standard froms of photography ineffective.

The conclution of this statementis that avery scientific explore what they waht to knoe ore sand people that they can get informayion form travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
