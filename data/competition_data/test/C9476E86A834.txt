Certain school districts offer online classes and video conferences as a way to complete high school. Although various students have disabilities or individualized circumstances which require them to partake in school activities from home, the average student would not benefit from completing school at home because students would sacrifice vital social interactions, students would not be adequately equipped for the workplace, and students would ultimately be excluded from a traditional high school experience. For most students, school is better experienced in a physical building where students will be able to receive more than simply an education. Students in physical schools also receive specialized components which will assist them through various aspects of their lives.

To begin with, students participating in strictly online courses are excluded from the privilege of interacting with their peers on a daily basis. The bonds students form with other classmates are enforced by daily conversing. Students enrolled in online school are isolating themselves and depriving themselves of the opportunity to be surrounded with youths in similar age groups and similar ways of self expression. Isolation and loneliness can easily lead to depression if a student is susceptible to such mental illnesses. Students who find themselves lacking social interactions can possess low self esteem because they are not receiving validation from people they respect. The most obvious effect of isolation is simply boredom, for a student spending no time with other students is guaranteed to experience a harsh level of loneliness.

Moreover, students enrolled in online school are not being prepared for a professional environment in the same level as students in public or private school. In physical schools, students are subjected to various tasks and situations which mimic those in the workplace. Students completing schooling from home will not experience situations such as collaborations or presentations. Collaborating with people that possess conflicting skill sets and opinions is an ability students should be exposed to from a young age so they are better equipped to deal with it in their occupations. Oral presentation skills should also begin developing at a young age to improve public speaking and anxiety affiliated with public speaking as an adult. Students in online school also lack motivation given from other students. Encouragement from peers is an uplifting strategy to gain motivation and complete a task to the best of one's ability.

Additionally, youths completing school from home are missing out on a classic high school experience. The high school experience can be regarded in many different ways depending on the person in question. A majority of adults would describe it as basic element of a semi privileged life. Although different people experience negative and positive emotions throughout the duration of high school, a plethora of individuals create lasting memories and cherish their traditional high school years. Impacting events during high school include finding a passion, attending school sponsored events, and joining a club or sport. School is essential in shaping a person's interests because it allows people to find other people with common interests. Students in public and private schools are more likely to discover their hidden preferences because they are generally encouraged to do so by the administration and staff.

In conclusion, students will not benefit from participating in school strictly online or through online video conferences because they are sacrificing any potential advancement in social skills, they are not as likely to succeed in a traditional occupation, and they are not given a genuine high school experience. If able students do not attend public school, their overall success will be diminished. It is imperative that the majority of students complete their education in a physical environment.
