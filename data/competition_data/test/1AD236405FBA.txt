Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, I think that the school cell phone policy should get changed to the second policy that states "do not allow students to have cell phones at school at all". I think this because the students could still use their phones even if the rules say to have them turned off. I don't think just having your phone turned off will stop you from using it later on during class. When students are not aloud to have them at school for whatever reason, it can prevent the students from getting distracted during class because of texting during class or study hall while you can be doing extra credit work. Their is also downfall's that include the students needing to call for a ride if their parent didn't come to pick them up or not knowing if their parent is working overtime and needs to pickup someone else. No matter what I would still pick the second policy because their are more pros than cons.
