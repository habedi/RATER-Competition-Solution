I agree with the principal on this decision. Extracurricular activities allow us to learn new things which we can use later on in our lives. Colleges and jobs like people who are determined to learn and try new things. These activities allow us to get a full grasp on life and truly live through it. We can use these activities to meet new people and make new friends. Extracurricular activities shape peoples lives, which is why I will be explaining why everybody should try at least one activity.

Firstly, extracurricular activities allow us to learn new things which we can use later on in our lives. These activities spark new hobbies and interests which shed some joy on life. Their are a variety of activities around the world which lead to a vast amount of things people can learn including, a language, a new sport, or a musical instrument. These activities allow us to do things other than sitting at home watching television. We need to put a good change in our lives otherwise their is no point in living it.

Secondly, colleges and jobs like people who are determined to learn and try new things. Extracurricular activities show we can handle multiple things at once, which allows employers to know you can handle the work they give you. Also, after learning something from an extracurricular activity you can use it to help your associates at work which could lead you to getting promoted. Colleges like people who enjoy trying new things, it shows you are willing to do the things the college has to offer, which looks good for the school. Colleges also like people who use the knowledge that the school gives to them instead of wasting it on nothing at home.

Lastly, we can use these activities to meet new people and make new friends. If you do go to extracurricular activities their is a good chance you will meet new people who like the same activity that you do and it's someone that you can talk to. Humans need companionship, and an easy way to find friends is through extracurricular activities which give us someone to laugh and have a conversation with. We don't want to be lonely all our lives, and an easy way to get around that is to make friends, friends help us when we fall ,and cheer us on when we get up, we help them and they help us and everybody feels great when doing so.

We need to realize all the good extracurricular activities have to offer by now. They help us learn new things, meet new people, and get a better college education and a job. These activities shape our lives and give us something to enjoy and look forward to daily. We need to appreciate all the opportunities we have to learn new things that other people don't. We can't waste this precious life away by doing nothing fun or exciting, to fully get a grasp on life we need to reach out and grab it. Our principal isn't torturing us by making us do an activity, he's trying to help us in this short but amazing life of ours.
