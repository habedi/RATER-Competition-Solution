Some schools in Virginia are adopt a program that benefit students that can't be in school for some reason. I agree with the idea,this idea consist that students can attend to their classes from home by the way of video conference or online.First, students with health problems are going to be benefit.Second, also students that have responsibilities in their homes, how having a full time job, can finish school with the help of this program.Finally, students that have problem with transport are also benefit with this awesome idea.On the other hand, some patterns said that their children have to be in school and have the same treat than other students and that schools should find another way to help these students.

I think the idea is going to be a great help for students with health problems.First, when my sister was in school she had problem with her legs and its' was very difficult for her to come to school every day,if this idea was approved four years ago it will help my sister a lot. Second, students with health issues in my school were very happy went their heard about the idea that our school was implemented so, its very difficult for they to come school when their feel bad. Finally, my friend PROPER_NAME is 15 years old he get sick easily his body defense are not like the others people and he was very happy when he heard the notice, he told me " I can't believe that our school thought on me and the others students with disabilities" I told him that I was very happy for him.

Students with responsibilities are also benefit.First, they can get a job and finish high school in the same time.Second,they can contribute on the house paying some bills how: pay their own room,bulling their food, or paying water and electricity bills.Finally, they are going to be in school and it is not going to affect them, if they are planning go to college in their future.

Students that have transport problem also apply. First, some students live to far and is difficult for they come to school and this idea is something that their are considering.Second, some students used Uber to come school and it is very expensive, some of them can't pay 10 to 30 dollars per day.Finally, some patterns are thinking to change their sons for another school that can provide transport to their sons.

In conclusion, students with health problems how my sister and PROPER_NAME are going to be benefit.Also many students that have responsibilities, like have a job to help their families students will help them and in the same time they are going to finish their school.Finally, students with transport problems can apply to the program many of them live to far and its hard to come school every day. I hope this idea can be implemented in many schools and help a lot kids like is helping the students in my School.
