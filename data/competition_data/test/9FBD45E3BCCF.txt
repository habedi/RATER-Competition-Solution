Luke's point of view the seagoing cowboys program is great. it's becuase you learn new some inpornt tips and skills. it theches you thing. like how skills you'll need later on in life. after you make nine trips you'll be ready to get drafted to the military. when you get ready to go to the military they tell things that you'll going to need there. They helped luke prepare for hard work. on your second trip you serve as a nightman. luke loved being on board because all the wonderful and fun things they do.

It opens up the to you. you will ride in a cattle boat every where you go. you will learn how to servie in the pacific war. you will broad a lot of different boats. you have to maked nine copmte trips before you can be drafted to military or the army. They have a lot of tools and skills that you will need when the program ends. in the program it takes a lot of hard work and you need to be strong because you have to lift a of boxes. you will glad that you went when the program is over.
