Summer projects given to students should be teacher designed.

Depending on the class that the project is for the student could have no idea what to make the project about.

It makes it easier to grade if every student has the same criteria and rubric.

The teacher would also have a good understanding of what the project is about.

Teachers designing the project would make more sense.

If a student is taking a class they have no idea about then they would not know what to base the project on.

Take chemistry for example.

The students taking the class could have no idea what chemistry is about.

If the teacher designed the project it would make it easier on the student to complete the project.

That student would know what to research and how to construct the project.

It makes it much easier on the students if they were given guidelines on what to do.

Having a teacher designed project would make it much more simple to grade.

If every student has the same project then the teacher could just use the same rubric every year.

For student designed projects there would have to be a new rubric created for each project.

When every student has the same criteria it makes it that much easier to grade all of the projects.

It makes it a lot easier on the students also to be able to look at the rubric.

That way they can base their projects off of the criteria on the rubric.

The teacher knows what the topic is about.

It does not matter if they're a math, history, science, English, or even a gym teacher.

They are the ones that knows most about their subject.

With them being the ones that know about the subject it would make it easier to create the project.

It makes it easier to get the ball rolling when they can tell the students what to base their projects on.

The teachers are the ones that went to college to get their degrees so they are the ones qualified to create the projects foundations.

It just makes the project easier because the teachers have a good understanding of the subject.

Ultimately teacher should design summer projects for students.

Students are not aware of what the class is about so they could not be able to construct an experiment.

Grading papers is a lot less complicated when there is a set rubric for the teacher to look off of.

The teacher is the one that knows what the subject is about so they should be the ones creating the project guidelines.

Teachers are the ones that have the qualifications to create summer projects.
