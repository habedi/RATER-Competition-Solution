Is online school and video conferencing beneficial for students then regular school. I think it isn't beneficial for online school and video conferencing and here is three reason why. The first reason is that the student could only learn and talk to the teacher. The second reason is that the student could leave when ever they wanted to because there is no one that can tell them no. The last reason why the should not do online school and video conferencing is that the student could cheat on any thing like for references test,quiz,exams and the school wouldnt have a clue if it was true or false. That why I think the should not do online school and video conferencing.

The student would only learn and hear form the teacher and wouldnt hear any one else thoughts. The student might be afraid to tell question or comments to the teacher. The student would not get help from any one else but the teacher. Teacher could be rude and disrespectful and might teach to fast or to slow. The student might not be able to know want the teacher is talking about. The teacher might be frustrating the student without even knowing. The student might just walk away from the computer. That why i think that one benefit you will lose in online school.

The student could leave at any time and not have to do the hours of requirement the students in school have to.

The student would be able to do any thing because the is no one there to tell the student want to do and want not to do. Here a example the student could be on their phone have their tabs open the teacher on the other side of the screen would have no clue. The student could take the computer were ever they want. so for example the could be doing the school work in fast food restaurants,library and other place and the teacher could tell them what to do. because the student wouldn't care at all. The only thing the online teacher could possible to is the the corporate about this issue. That is another issue that only online school will have and not with regular schools.

The student could cheat without the teacher knowing at all. There is a lot of thing the student could cheat on like here are examples home work,quiz's,exams and test. I will give you a example a student is doing a test and dose not want to fall because their family needs him to pass to help them out in the future. In school he couldnt cheat because the teacher would see them doing. But online there could be a friend or family member help the cheat on the test so they can pass and help their family out in the future. There are many situation for the student to cheat it could help the or there family or it can be bad of them but ether way it is still bad to cheat any way. that is a another reason what you can do in online school that you cant do in regular schools.

That is my thoughts on why you should not have online school they are great in some way but over all. I think they should not need to if need they should but that they only reason i know of. But that is my over all thoughts on for why not to have online school. You could cheat on test, homework, quiz,ects. you could go were ever you want to go. that only person you could talk to is the teacher. That why i think that they should not have online school or video conferencing then regular school.
