Have you ever considered the fact that not many schools have enough players on the soccer team or not enough people serving on different clubs? If schools tell students that they need to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it could result in many benefits. I believe that students should be forced to participate at least one extracurricular activitie because it gives students hobbies, it allows students to improve their skills, and it keeps students healthy.

To begin with, extracurricular activities can give students hobbies they did not have before. Many students get bored from time to time. Whenever I get bored, for instance, I always turn to my phone. Whether it's playing games, watching videos, or texting someone, I use my phone to cure my boredom. If students were forced to be a part of any extracurricular activity, they would spend less time looking at a screen and spend more time learning new hobbies. Students would also be able to relieve stress from school. I know from experience that school work and tests can be extremely stressful and sometimes you need a break. Students who are given a hobby can also teach other students or family members what they know. If a student plays on the basketball team, then they can show their friends or siblings tricks and techniques that they learned.

Another reason I believe that students should take part in extracurricular activities is because it allows students to improve their skills. For example, working with others can improve students' communication skills. It also allows students to be able to talk to their peers and collaborate with others. Serving on the student council or playing a sport can make students responsible for something. Responsibility can be very important in the future. For instance, future jobs may want their workers to be responsible and set a good example to other people. If students improve their skills, not only would it benefit them, but it could also benefit others. To illustrate, if a student improves their soccer techniques and continues pursuing soccer, they can end up playing on a professional soccer team in the future.

Lastly, contributing in an extracurricular activity can keep students healthy. If students are playing a sport, they are keeping themselves active and in shape. Even if students are not playing a sport, they are keeping their minds off of schoolwork and other problems going on in their life by being focused on their activity. This helps students keep themselves mentally healthy. If students are kept healthy, their performance in school would significantly improve. They would pay more attention in class which could result in them doing better on tests and getting better grades.

Many schools need extra help. Either they don't have enough students on the soccer team or not enough people serving on different clubs. I believe that more schools should enforce students to either play a sport or join a club to solve the problem caused by lack of volunteers. Forcing students to take part in one extracurricular activity could lead to giving students a hobby, letting students work on their skills, and it keeps students mentally and physically healthy.Â
