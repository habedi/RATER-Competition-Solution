Are there any advantages on limiting car usage? I think that there would be advantages to the earth but not for people. Why I think that there would be advantages to the earth is because it would reduce the air pollution. But there is one problem...How would people go places? The people would have to find a way to get to places.

One way to reduce air pollution would be to limit car usage. In th efirst passage paragraph three Heidrun walter says "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now." This statement means that when she had a car she was tenesed and without a car she is way more happier. But I feel like they shouldn't limit all car usage but they should limit some. In the secound passage paragraph ten it says "Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city." How they parcially banned driving is they would let the odd lisenes plates drive one day and the even licenes plates drive the other day. I thought that was a really good ideal. It would clear up the smog but still allow people to drive places.

The one problem is that people wouldn't have anyway to get to places if they banned cars. I mean they could walk but how would people go and see their families that live in a different state. They couldn't walk all the way to a different state with all of their luggage. In the secouned passage paragraph eleven it says that "On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). The same would apply to odd-numberded plates the following day." This was meaning that if you wanted to go somewhere you would have to go by your license plate. I mean it would work out really good to do this every other day thing but it would be a pain in the butt because what if you accendently go out and that day wasn't your day to drive? you would get a ticket even if you didn't mean to.

In conclusion limiting peopels advantages on car usage would be a pain. I think it is a really good idea because it would reduce car pollution and air pollution but I don't think that they should limit it. Also people would have many difficulties like not being able to go somewhere because it isn't their day. What if it was an emergency? Limiting car usage would be hard for everybody to follow and I don't think if they really want to do it they should only do it for like one or two days a week.
