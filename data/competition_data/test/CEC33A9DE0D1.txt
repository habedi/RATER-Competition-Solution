When picturing a home the first thing that probably comes to mind is a cozy red brick building with a triangular roof and a rectangular chimney. One doesn't immediately correlate a house with a school. A house is where one simply sleeps, eats, and spends time with family. It's good for a person to have a comfort place where they are not constantly worrying about school and for a lot of people that comfort place is their home. While many may argue that homeschooling is the most beneficial form of education, traditional classroom environments allow students to easily make new friends, be more interactive with their learning, and get their work done.

Personally, I have made most of my closest friends in school. The variation of classes I have in a day give me the chance to talk to people I don't usually talk to and form bonds with people I will never forget. If I were restricted to learning at home I wouldn't be able to socialize as much as I do now. This traditional schooling environment also prepares students for a real working environment. In the "real world" people are expected to collaborate with others and work with people for their occupation. Without actually working with others in school, it would be a lot harder to adapt in a work setting.

In addition, participation and hands on learning has truly allowed me to better understand concepts taught in class. Asking questions and discussing any confusion I may have with my peers helps me better understand what we are learning. At home, a student wouldn't be able to discuss any doubts they have with their peers. In addition, hands on learning and participation allows students to better understand certain concepts.

In a normal classroom, the teacher gives a lecture and students are allowed to ask questions and participate when the instructor asks a question. However, in a home schooled setting students wouldn't receive this interactive style of learning and would have to resort to teaching themselves after an online class is completed. The interactive nature of a traditional classroom helps visual and auditory learners better understand concepts taught in class.

Lastly, the classroom setting makes students more motivated to get work done. If I were home schooled then I wouldn't be as motivated to get my work done. I would be more prone to watching TV or taking a nap. Traditional schools force students to work hard and complete their work in a particular span of time. Also, The classroom setting doesn't give off a tiresome climate among students. However, a cozy home gives off a sleepy ambiance. If students are given homework during a long break, they don't complete it until its towards the end of the break. Home schooling would promote this behavior and make students less motivated to complete their work.

In conclusion, traditional classrooms serve as the most beneficial form of learning as it allows students to make new friends, learn through participation, and gets them motivated to actually work hard. Schools closely resemble a working environment as previously mentioned. In a "real world" setting, people go to work, complete all of their tasks, and come home. This is what school is like. Students go to school, complete their assignments, and come home. Traditional schools better prepare students for life after school. Which is why traditional schools serve as the best form of education.
