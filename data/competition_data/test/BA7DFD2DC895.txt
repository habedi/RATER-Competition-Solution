The best experience from teenage students are at school. School offer fun activities for classes. Students can make so many friends when they are in school. Although some school offer online schooling, being in school is probably the better choiceÂ because students won't slack off at home and you do more fun activities at school with friends.

Getting home schooled isn't the safest choice for a student. Students now will usually have a cell phone or some electric device that would keep students distracted from taking their classes, or doing their work. Cheating could also effect their career because then they won't the stuff on the bigger test like the SOL and the SAT. Students might just slack off. Online classes probably won't teach them life lesson and have fun activities.

Schools have so much more to do than taking classes online at home. Students will always have help for questions at school and they don't have to look it up. In schools, students could always make friends and do lots of activities with them. There is never cheating on any test and quizzes.

Online testing isn't the best thing students, it's probably the less boring for them. They won't have to wake up as early as regular student does when they have school. Their classes have shorter time then regular schools. The best part is probably that you will always be home.

Students will have the most benefits when they are at school and not at home taking online classes. Online make students slack off and not do their work. In school, students will have friends and do fun activities. They will just have the best experience when they are at school.
