In this story, the author talks about how humans are capable of landing on Venus and checking the planet out. He states that there are many dangers like the high atmospheric pressure Venus has, and that Venus has the hottest temperature surface in all of the planets. Each mission they had was unmanned, and no space craft survived a landing for more than a few hours. The author supports his claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers bad because he explains that there are more dangers than possibilities and they have just conducted research and never tried or invented anything he states yet.

NASA says they could create a blimp- like vehicle that hovers about 30 or so miles above Venusian landscape. This would work out because they have liveable conditions from where they are floating at, but they couldn't do anything with the info they get. When they are 30 miles above the ground it makes it difficult because most forms of light can only cover the dense atmosphere. The text states, "Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance." This is saying that scientists wouldn't be able to take substances form Venus back home to the US and the scientists would mainly have to explain all there observations from sight. The author also talks about how scientists are working on innovations and certain inventions that have not happend yet so he can't explain more details on how they could make it to Venus but many things have to be innovated first.

NASA is also working on other approaches to get to Venus, but we can't start sending people to Venus if we don't even know if the invention or approach could work. There are more dangers than ways to get to Venus safely in this article so that is also a reason why I think he does a bad job supporting his claim. Venus to me is not really worth researching for just because of those conditions that the planet has, but if the blimp-like thing works out, I still think the scientists wouldn't be able to see what they wanted and get no good evidence. Like I said, pictures and any light source would be hard to get when you're in Venus. NASA and other researchers should focus on a different planet than Venus because It would be way to difficult to get people there, yet alone get reseach from Venus.
