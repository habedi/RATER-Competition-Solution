Not driving can clean up the air for the global city and wont take to much pollution in Paris . In paris people with any kind of veichle that contains a motor with evan -numbered license plates had to levae their cars at home or have to deal with a 22-euro fine . It would apply the next day to the odd-number license plates too. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined . People would have their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine .
