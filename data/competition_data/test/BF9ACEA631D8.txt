The majority of people expect is the best way students can learn is going to the school than attendÂ classes from home, when they are taking classes online from home sometimes they never look at it or never do the work, because nobody is telling him to do the work or go to learn. If the students go to the school and they don't work, teacher can call their parents and tell as about their child.

Sometimes students need help with someting like if they don't understand or they have a lot of work, teacher can teach again and again and if the boy or girl can't get it the teacher can teach in other way, the other students can help or helping each other, also if the teacher give a lot of work students can have a partner to share the work and that way can be more easy to have the work done.

If the parents want to know if their kids are learning in school, they can ask in the school how their kids going in each classes, the teacher can send an e-mail to each parents to know his or her grades, if he need more help to learn and with that the parents can know if they are learning or not, and also the school can call the parents if their child are not going to the class and talk with their child what happen.

The parents can feel more confidents because they child are learning, teacher can teach more better than have online classes at home, they can receive more help because the teacher are their for anything they needs. And some schools has eagle block for students who need help with one class or they need more time to study. They can get textbooks and look in classe with that.

But some people like more their kids receive classes at home, some parents like mom or dad can stay at home and watch if they are learning or not, their are some classes online with more information than school has, they can watch video conferencing because they can explain more clearly.
