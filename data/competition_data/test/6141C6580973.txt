Luke has crossed on the atlantic ocean 16 times. It took him about two weeks to get there and back. He took care of the anmials on the crossing so that kept him busy most of the time. There is good things that happend and some bad things that happen with becoming a seagoing cowboy.

First, you need to be trained if u are not trained then why would you even go in the first place. You need to stay fit, u need to be able to survie with out food incase you run out or run out of water. Helping out on his aunts farm helped him get in shape and prepared for a real adventure. On his seconed trip he was the night watchman . That does not take so much hardwork but staying up is the key. He had to check on the animals every hour, and then tell about his hourly report. But he could not work for a while because he broke one of his ribs.

Next, he did not just go to help people even know that was his main priorty. he also went to see all thease beaituful places the would have been arriving to.

Then, they would still have fun on board it is not as bad as u think. You still get to play baseball and volleyball games where all the animals had been staying will they were on board. They played thease games to pass time, table - tennis tourmants, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

last, of all the cattle boat trips, were unbelievable opportiny for a small - town boy he says. Beside helping people getting to travel areound the world it was just brethtaking. Most of his trips were a susses I enjoyed the trips and can't wait for more.

To sum up my thoughts, I think he should go u still get fun out of this trip it is not like you have to work all day and night. He endeded up going and he had a great time. He said in this passage it opended up a whole new world for me. From day one crossing the atlantice ocean. I new right then and there this was a oppurtuntiy of a life time.
