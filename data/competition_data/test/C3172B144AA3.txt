Imagine having a student in your class asleep on his/her desk. Imagine asking him/her whats wrong and for his/her answer to be that they have been taking of their siblings all week long. What would you do in this situation? Students that already have enough on thier plate should not need another thing added like an after school activity. I don't think that students should have to do an after school activity because of students grades, their ability to handle it, and because of free will.

First of all, if a student does not have good grades they should not have to do (or even allowed) a extracurricular activity. When a student does not have good grades what he/she needs is help on how to fix those grades after school. They need to focuse on thier classes instead of a after school activity like basketball. For example, if a child has something to that day after school, but they have a test during the day, then they will not be able to focuse on the test.

Instead, they will be think of thier basketball game or thier student council meeting. Who are we to take a childs chance of learning away.

Second, we don't know what is going on a childs life. We don't know if they have to take care of thier sick mother or if they have to take care of his/her siblings. In certain situations it might even be a struggle for a child to come to school. We cannot force a struggling student to stay after school extra hours if we do not know the situation in his/her home. We don't know if those students need to work extra hours so his/her families can survive or if we take that child away for extra hours we don't know who's going to take care of their little siblings. We need to make a struggling child's live easier not harder.

Third all, if a child does not want to go to a after school activity, then we can't force them. It is the law of free will. The school already controls, for the most part, a childs life. If a child does not want to go to an after school activity, it could be for a good reason. For example maybe that child wants to spend time with thier family. A child could even not want to go to an extracurricular activity because kids are bullying him/her and we force him/her to go then we are forcing them to spend more time with the bullies. On top of that teachers give out homework and you might say "thats only,like,thirty minutes,". Yeah,well its only thirty minutes per class. Middle and Highschool students have up to eight classes. Eight times thirty is four hours of doing homework and on top of that, we have to stay after school. That would be like a straight twelve hours of school. That is more hours then most people work. Think about that.

Overall, Student should not have to stay after school because of students grades, their ability to handle it, and because of free will. If we go back to the student from the beginning we can see that, that child is tired and probaly not doing good in his classes because of that. I don't want to make a suffering chil suffer anymore. Now, do you?
