Dear principal,

I think your idea about community service is great. Most children need tutors or help with homework. So if you don't mind i have some ideas on how to help our community succeed. For example i think putting straight A+ students with kids who need help with homework or if they need tutors would be one major step in our community becoming even greater. My next thought would be making our streets cleaner, some of these slackers in the school need to do work so having them clean would be a great idea. My last thought would be to put athletic kids to work making sure our communities people stay fit and healthy, maybe setting up athletic projects around campus would help?

So i have proposed ways to help our community. I know they all sound terrific but just make sure you to give kids time off. So here comes my next thought, community service is great i am with it but us kids need time off because trust me, were are not super humans. To add on to it we need time off community service, two or three times a week sounds good. All of us have chores around the house so if somebody can't make it you cannot get mad all they have to do is call in. On top of it some people have family to visit, sports to do, and need free time to hang out with friends.

Now ill tell you why i think wee need community service. First of all i think so many people are lazy and just sit around all day doing nothing. Next thing is that so many people just through trash all over the place and never in a trash bin. And my last thing is that so many kids are not getting the education they need its terrible. I think we should to have more people helping kids become smart young people than being idiotic in school sincerely, a caring student
