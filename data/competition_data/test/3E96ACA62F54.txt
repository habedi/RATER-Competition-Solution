You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The cattle-boat trips are an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But when Luke went to see the Acropoils in Greece he said it was specail. He also said that gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Luke also found fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys would have so much fun the would play baseball and volleyball in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you can have a lot of fun there its fun, helpful to people, entertainig you if you are bored and its cool and it has a lot of space. You can save people and animals. You can save the person if they are drowning by your boat or you can save an animals if they fall of your boat.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. Luke said it opended up the world to him he said he is grateful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. That aware stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night,after making his hourly report to the captain, he slide down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart racedas he shot feet first torwads the opening on the side of the ship. Thats when he figured out he had more room to play his games. I hoped that helped you and I hope you join the Seagoign Cowboys program and thats why you should go you can experince different stuff that you never knew.
