Would you rather wake up early every day just to go to school and feel grumpy every morning? Or would you attend school at your house? The 2nd option sounds better right? But,is it really that nice? Going school is more than learning about old people fighting,numbers,reading,and writing essays. Its about making friends and connecting with teachers and be more responsible. Also one importent thing about school is that its free. Online classes are expencive,hard to get used to,and impossible to work at home. This is why attending online school wont be worth it.

First of all,.online classes can go up to 150 to 200 dollars. So, some students cant afford the classes. If you want to get online classes, you must get a job and work for weeks just to pay for online classes. When you can just go to school for free. Also if you do get a job it will affect your work at school and it will affect your job. So. is it worth it?

Secend of all, students can not focus when they are at home. Cant work on your homework because your little brother is crying nonstop? Just imagine doing an online class for 90 minutes at home. Also, home is a place to rest,have free time,and spend time with family and friends. Home is not a place for school.

Lastly,online classes can be hard to get used to. You have been in a class room this hole time in school. Now you have to get used to something new. Change can be hard on students. But,now they are all by themself in there house learning how to get through this online class. Where theres no one to help you but you. I am taking an online class in my last year of high school. Its hard. Its really hard. You wont understand what to do and what not to do. Because there is nobody showing me how to do it. Its just a 3 minutes video and now i have to wright a 3 page essay. And not knowing what kind an essay to wright. Sometimes there are no videos to help you.

Some people say that online classes are better then regular school. Well they are worng. Heres why,school can help you get your commnicaion skills up and help you grow as a person. Teachers at school can help you to get through the class. In online class you dont know if you are doing something right or worng. There is no one to giude you but yourself. It is not better then regular school when you think about it. Online classes you are so limited you dont understand. At school you will have some many more opitions for you.

in conclusion waking up at 6 oclock is going to be worth it at the end. If you attend online school the only person is going to help you is you. Or you can make friends,do group activites,and enjoy every last minute if it in school.
