I am against the developement of driverless cars. I do not t think driverless cars are safe. In my opinion, I think driverless cars are more dangerous than driving a car normally. A problem can occur when the driverless car is driving. Maybe it is simply because there was a system malfunction with the car, or it could be because when the car tells the driver to take back over the driver is not paying attention. Someone will get injured, and it is not worth it.

Driverless cars are not completely driverless. Whether it is because the driver has to keep their hand on the wheel when the car is driving its self, or because the car will ask the driver to take over when it approaches a sticky situation. Yes, drivers do get tired of driving, but what's the point of having a driverless car if you still have to drive anyway? It's a waste of time and money. In paragraph nine, the author states that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Therefore, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.

If there was an accident when the driverless car was driving, who would be a fault? The driver or the manufacturer. A driverless car is too much of a hassle to me. Maybe if in the future car dealerships make cars able to drive on there own no matter the situation, and it was completely 100% safe I would agree that driverless cars are the way to go. Although, as of right now, I am against driverless cars. Drivers should drive themselves wherever they need to go and not have a car driving for them.
