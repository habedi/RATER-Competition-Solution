Drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones because it can cause so many problems, if they are being distracted they could cause an accident, they could run someone over, and they can also cause big problems. All this can be stopped but many people don't really care enough for that, even if there has been a law passed they still will keep texting and driving.

The people that text and drive are mostly teens, they never seem to put their phones down. Many teens have died from texting while driving, but that will never put an effect to the teens. You can tell a teen to stop texting and driving but they will never listen, they will keep doing it till they end up in an accident. About 1,300,000 are killed by car accidents, most of them are caused by distracted drivers. Many people do get killed by the accident but many are left disabled, meaning they won't be able to walk for years, but they are also left with the memory of them getting ran over. So many people nowadays stay on their phone, a text can wait. If you're are a traffic light, that text can wait till you're at your destination. Yes, there are many impatient people,but they should understand there are many people dying by one simple text, or a simple call.

By being distracted by their phone, they don't pay attention. A teen can look down for a quick second and they could run over a kid. Many people need to realize that texting while driving can cost a lot, it can cost someone's life.

Even adults end up killing children. If you can't wait to send a text after you finish driving, then you shouldn't be driving at all. You can seriously end up killing one person over one simple little text that can wait. About 55 million people die a year, about a million of them are from texting and driving.

Therefore the law does nothing really, it won't stop people from using their phones. They will keep using their phones till they end up causing an accident or actually killing someone.

Using the phone while driving is very dangerous, but no one will listen till it happens to them. Many people die a day, if we don't hear it on the news, it happens no matter what.
