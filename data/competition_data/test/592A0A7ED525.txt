Students should not have to participate in extracurricular activity if they dosenÃÂ´t want to participate.

School is already stressful enough for us students so what makes our principal think we wanna stay back any longer in school.

So no i do agree and disagree that students should participate with extracurricular activity for school.

Sport is and extracurricular activity.

In sports the coaches be so strict and you dont be able to do anything, and I understand some coaches be strict because games be coming up, but still Its really unnecessary to yell at the students just because the fumbled a ball or air balled.

The food they give you before practice or a game is supposed to be healthy, Doritos and hot chips are not healthy.

Students might as well just go home and eat all the snacks they want if thats the case.

Most students just do sports to just hang out with their friends out of school.

I mean you can do that away from school thats better than hanging out with your friend in school with strict adults. And most of the school sports are for boys If the school board adds more sports thats for girls maybe students will want to participate.

One extracurricular activity students probably would do is the year book.

The year book is memories for students and If all students participate in year book that would make the principal happy.

Students also enjoy signing the year book for everyone to take with them because that might be the last time they see them.

Some students might not like the year book.

Some might not even wanna be apart of the year book.

Some kids just dont like school and dont wanna be apart of any of the school extracurricular activities. Students will love to work on the year book with their peers.

Extracurricular activities might cheer up students day It might also ruin so students days. Student probably should at least participate in one but students donÃÂ´t have to If they really dont want to. Some students cant purchase to do sports or purchase a year book. But there are some sports that students dont have to pay for so they can enjoy their self and live their life like a kid and not have to suffer because they bored all day or depressed because they have none to with themselves.

So at first i didnt agree or disagree that students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity but now I agree because It brighten us students up.
