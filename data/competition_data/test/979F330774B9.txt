Students in some schools are being offered distance learning by taking classes from home as an option of their education and I do not think they are going to gain educational benefits from it because of a-lot of reasons.

Firstly, I do not think they would benefit from distance learning is because almost all students have distractions at home. For example, if a student is home taking a class online, they will mostly have a distraction like a phone which will distract them a-lot from focusing and studying which can effect their grades a-lot as well.

Secondly, they would not benefit because a teacher is very important for every class. For example, If a student needs extra help, they would need someone to help them like a teacher. If a teacher is right there with the student to help, the student can get all his questions answered easily. Some students need extra help with their assignments.

Lastly, in my last reason I would say, they would not benefit from it because they are going to miss out all extra school activities and not be able to volunteer in anything. For example, football games or theme week in high school are so much fun for students to create so many fun memories to look back at to in the future. All students should experience these activities in their high school life to create enjoyable memories for their future.

This is why I think students would not benefit from distance learning education and it should not be optional unless the student or their family has an acceptable reason for the student to take their classes online.
