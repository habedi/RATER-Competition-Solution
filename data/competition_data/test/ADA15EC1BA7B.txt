Would I want technology to read students emotional expressions,no cause I would'nt want people in my head knowing how i feel that's ain't nobody problem to know how i feel. TO me that's weird that technology can do that.

Why would they want that,some people like to be by they self when they in they feelings.

In paragraph 1it say that at least according to some new software that can recognize emotions.
