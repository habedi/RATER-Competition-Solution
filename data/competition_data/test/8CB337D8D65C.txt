Should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschooled ?

In my honest opinion, I think student should benifit from being homeschooled is that, There would be less distractions then there are in an actual public schools or private schools then there are in Home school communities.

I think this true because there are alot of distractions in school and students do not realize that those distractions could be the cause of the reason as to why they are not learning and possibly why they might be failing their classes. For example, Students usually arrive late to class only because they hanging out with their friends in the halls and paying less attention to what their timely scheduele is at school, and if a student arrives late to class, They have missed part of what they are about to learn for the day and distract others from their learning.

Another reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be no attendance policy and you get to learn things faster. I think this is true because, There are always those types of students who always arrive to school/class late and have already missed out on half of the lesson only beacuse they couldn't get thereselves up in the morning just to get to school. Also, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time but it also distracts others who are trying to learn. If you get home schooled you are also learning things faster, Because, you don't have anybody holding you back from you learning time and you get to move on in a faster pace then others; For example, Say if some students cannot figure out how to complete a lesson, It just makes it slower for the class because everyone has to understand the subject in order to move on to the next portion of the lesson.

However, Reasons as to why I do not think students would benefit from going to school at home. The reason why I think this is true is because the amount of time of learning that would be set up at home would be diffrent at home then at school; for example, students might get to comfortable at home and might think they can get up from bed at whatever time they please. Another example of why a student would not benefit from going to school at home is because, the home school student would be distracted by their surroundings. Since the student is are very familiar with their enviroment at home, it would be very hard to pay attention and listen to what you are learning only because you are distracted of your familiar surroundings.

In Conclusion, These are all the reasons and examples as to why I think should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschoold.
