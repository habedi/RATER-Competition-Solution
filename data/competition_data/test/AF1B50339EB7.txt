The Seagoing Cowboys program is a wonderful expirience. The trips you took were an unbelievable opportunity. By 1947 I had made nine trips which was the most trips any Seagoing Cowboy has made. These are the expiriences I had being a Seagoing Cowboy that will convince you to join the program.

It all started in 1945 when World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. Helping people is a wonderful thing to do and that is something I got to do while being a Seagoing Cowboy. I also got to help lots of animals that were shipped overseas in the World War ll by feeding them and caring for them. Some of the animals I got to care for were horses, young cows, and mules. Also by being a Seagoing Cowboy I got to visit lots of different countries and meet new people. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy was very special to me. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It is also very fun on board with the other cowboys. We played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. These games weren't only fun but they also helped pass some of the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy has opened the world to me. It has made me more aware of the people from different countries and their needs. If more people join this amazing program they will most likely expirience the different countries that I had been to and meet the different people that I have met. The Seagoing Cowboy program is truely a wonderful expirience.
