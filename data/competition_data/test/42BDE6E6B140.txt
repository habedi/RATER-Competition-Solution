Dear Mr. Principal,

I disagree with your change in the school policy of having at least a B grade average to play in sports or other school activities. It is wrong because a lot students of students have c grade average. I know if you want to be in the team you have to have good grades but, a C is a good grade average.

Making the grade to a C grade average will help the school and the students. It will let more students go on the team, that makes the school look good. The students will tire hard to have a C grade average. Besides a C is not bad, its an aright grade if you ask me.

Say a students is a good all rounded student and he's on the school soccer team with a 80%. He missing a week of school because he's sick and gets a C. Making it a C grade average would let him be on the team, then later he can get his grade up again. It happens a lot so why not take the grade average to a C.

your student,
