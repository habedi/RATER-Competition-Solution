Dear Principal,

It seams to me that you have a idea of changing the school policy to students that play sports may not play them if they are not maintaining a B grade average in school. I think this is preposterous because some of our best athletes that play sports don't maintain a B average most of them make a C average. We will lose all of our good sport records and will not be able to win in any of the sports that we play in like wrestling, football, soccer, baseball and other sports. This will bring our school's reputation down to nothing.

This school is based on our work and our sports but some of our people who do the best in our sports will not be able to play anymore and them what are we going to do about our sport records. Also you have to think about all the people in the school that will not be able to play sports and will get fat if they don't have anything else to do in there extra time. If you change that students will not have no exercise and will do nothing but play video games and then we will have nothing but couch potatoes at our school.

But you also make a good point in this because it may make people want to do more or better in there class rooms and then they will make better grades to be able to play sports. Maybe your plan will work and kids will do better in there school work and give us a better school report and it will be for sports and education and then we will have good sports teams and will have students who will make better grades in school.

People have different opions on this kind of stuff but mine is not on either side of the fence. I think that it will be kind of good to make it where kids are not aloud to play sports with c averages. But then we will lose an=lot of people in our sports and will not have good sports teams. Because some of the people will just continue to keep the grades they have and just not participate in sports. But some of the people will try harder and will make better grades just to participate in sporting events. Well all i can say is that this is your school you can do what you want to with it. You do what you think is right.
