Dear Principal,

You should allow kids to use there cell phones during lunch because they will be less likely to break the rules. The reason why kids break the rules is because they want to be able to brag about something they did that was against the rules or because they're simply not allowed to do it. This way, kids can't brag or the ones that do it because they can't will use it during lunch.

They could also talk to their parents if there's an issue that needs clarifying. Kids may need to be picked up early and aren't too sure about what to do. Maybe they need help with homework that they don't understand. If they don't feel good they could ask their parents to pick them up. Those are some advantages of use during lunch.

If there is an emergency during lunch they could call for help. If someone gets in a fight they could call someone to break it up. If there was a break in they could call the police. If there is a fire they could call the fire department. These are unlikely, but they could happen.

Those are the advantages of letting kids use cell phones during. They could feel sick and need to get home. They could see a fight going on and call someone to break it up. These are only some of the advantages of letting kids use cell phones during lunch. I hope this can convince you to use this policy.

Sincerely,
