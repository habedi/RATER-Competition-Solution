All students must do at least one extracurricular activity. That's what the principal said. I agree with his statement because students are allways stressed about home work,missing work,getting in trouble and friends. An extracurriculer activity is ment for you to have fun and be your self. Lets say your working on the year book and it is a lot of work but the whole school depends on you to do a good job. Now sports sports are a cool way to make friends and have teamwork that way you can acomplish your goal as a team.

Every student has a life out side of school whether that be waching tv,playing video games,spray painting biuldings or walking dogs. They all have lives but not a single one of them is the exact same. That's why we can get the kids who are good to have fun and the kids who are bad out of trouble. We could make the town a better place one kid at a time. This idea will also help with kids who don't have good grades.

By not letting them play or commpete if the dont have good grades that lets them work harder to get better grades.

A big part of life is being productive. Being productive is insted of me playing with my phone I help my dad fix a pipe. It's about getting thigs done and being usefull with your time. some kids dont play outside dont talk to their friends the play video games and wach tv. why do that when you could be playing sports,working on year book photos,talking on the debate team and doing there work for school. It's all about getting things done. That is why I think all students should do extracurricular activitys.
