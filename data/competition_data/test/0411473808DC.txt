I disagree with the principal making all students participate in a extracurricular activity.

I disagree with this idea because it comes with many cons.

I feel like students should make their own decision if they do a extracurricular activity or not.

Because if you force them to do so they might not put as much effort into it as if they choose to do it.

For example some students are not into things like joining the yearbook club because it may not interest them to take pictures of things and or people.

Students may also not be into student council because it does not catch their attention to do that type of thing.

The principal making all the students do a activity is a bad idea because conflict could start this way.

For example a fight could break out and it would be hard for the teachers to break it up because there is too many students.

There is many things to think about like is there enough teachers to run the class because some teachers may have to leave or do not want to stay after school for an activity.

Another thing to think about is what kind of activities would you have for all the students that interest all of them.

One more thing to think about is not having activities that interest some kids an example would be chess club.

Some kids are not interested in that and or do not know how to play chess or girls who code.

Because some girls tried to code and do not understand it or just do not like it.

Last but not least kids who do not want to be there may act up and prohibit other boys and girls from learning.

Which may lead to constant distractions to others and may disturb other classes.
