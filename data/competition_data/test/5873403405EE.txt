The face on Mars is created by aliens! I don't think the face on Mars was created by aliens. People are arguing over wether alien life form is on Mars. I think the face was created over time by the changes of the surface of Mars. The physical features of the face has changed over the years.

Wether people think that aliens created the faces, NASA is trying to figure out what is creating this face. Is it alien life form, is it the changes of the planet. We may never know until we arive on Mars in human presents.

Why do people beleive what others say, beleive what you think its is. scientests beleive that aliens on Mars that created the man. Why do you think so Scientest? Do you all beleive in everything you come up with. The man on mars could be where a meteore hit and it was froze over.

I don't think their is alien life form out their in space, or the other galaxies around us. i think we the humans, animals, pants and etc. species, are the only ones out there in the universe. So there is no one that created the man on Mars, it was only God that created the man on Mars. This is my opion about the man on Mars.
