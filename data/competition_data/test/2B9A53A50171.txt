I'm a teenager myself, phones are very addicted. They are like a key part of our life. People use cellphones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, planning, internet browsing etc. Sometimes we like to do two or more of these things at once. Some people are choosing the wrong times to use their cellular devices. When they are driving.

As a society we have became so focused on how much we can do at one time that we don't realize how it could be effecting our personal safety, and the safety of others around us. When driving its already pretty hard to stay focused on the road. Let alone with a handheld phone as a distraction. The roads are shared for everyone and not just you, don't let your dumb decision affect others life on the road as well.

Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if its causing us to be late to work school or whatever else it may be.

In the article made by Consultancy Buss Maven Labs, Scott Clark says "A young women killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone." She may not have intended to end the poor boys life but now she has to live with that. Any of us could have been that poor boy riding his bike. Don't be selfish!

There are many more ways to distract a drivers attention. Talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. Therefore, drivers have to operate the vehicle already. Why let a cellphone distract you trying to operate it at the same time? Cellphones while driving have caused thousands of wrecks across the world, some even leading to death upon the passenger or the people in the other car.

Think before you pick up your phone behind the wheel. Is it worth it? Your life and anybody in the car with you lifes could be gone just so you got to send that text. Focus on what is more important,

Getting to your destination. You can be on your phone another time. Hoped this helped you.
