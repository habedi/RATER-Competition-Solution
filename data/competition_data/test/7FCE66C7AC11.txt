Technology to read students emotions in classrooms are not valuable to me. I think using money on things like this is stupid. There are plenty of other things this money could be used on other than knowing students emotions. Maybe Thomas Huang can Find a way to help teachers teach without boring their students.

When looking at paragraph 7 it is telling us how to simply do this at school while looking in the mirror. People might try using your home PC but you computer cannot handle complex algorithms. You might want to grab a partner to do this with. The passage says,"In fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy." If the teacher used the Facial Action Coding System they would have to stop in the middle of class to have the computers on. Also read all the emotion just for them to know that they may or may not be entertaining their classes enough or that a student may be confused, thats why students need to raise their hand more. I really dont think its necessary that they have this in a classroom. This would be great to try if the teacher doesn't have anything plannned for the day. In paragraph 9 it says doing this experiment can make you feel slightly happy. Text says," Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them." In chapter 6 it says that it can make computer-animated faces more expressive for things like video games or video surgery. Its a good thing because most human communication is nonverbal, incuding emotional communication.

As I said earlier, I do not think this software is valuable in classrooms to read the emotional expressions of students. It may be good in other industries but not this one. I really think that this would be a good use for video surgery or games. I would be looking towards that.
