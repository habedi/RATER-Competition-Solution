What would living in a world without cars be like? It doesn't sound very pleasant. Getting from point A to point B would be a definite hassle, right? Well, not exactly. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the United States was back in January 1995. he number of miles driven here in the U.S. peaked in 2005 and has steadily dopped. Car usage is not onle dropping here, but around the world as well. Paris banned cars due to smog that was polluting the city. But, is using cars less all that bad? Nope! Here's why.

To begin with, it can help reduce pollution around the world. Source #2 states "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partialdriving ban to clear the air of the global city." That's how bad the pollution was in the City of Love. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined 22 euros because of using their car. "Congestion (traffic) was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." Sounds like a really bad title for a city that attracts many tourists every year. The ban allowed for the smog to clear.

Next, limiting car usage can benefit the current efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States," Source #1 states. If car usage is limited, it can help reduce the greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere by a significant amount. "President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United State's greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitious assist from te incipien shift in American behavior," Source #4 states " Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less." Good going, America!

Of course, many people might say "Why would not having a car be beneficial to me?" It certainly can be! "It's a good oppurtuinity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source #3. The stress of having to be careful with your car or face the consequences from the insurance policies or lawsuits can finally be lifted of your shoulders. You will be rid of the struggles of the rush hour, as well as the need to be having to pay for gas (which is not exactly cheap).

"Different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural drift, said Mimi Sheller in Source #4. This is a good thing to be a part of. Soon enough, we'll be seeing people walking and riding bikes from point A to point B, like they do in Vauban, Germany.Â  I don't know about future complete bans of cars here in the U.S, but I believe they will be far less common. When someone such as Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, is in on a business plan for a world where personal vehicle owneship is undesirable, you know you have to be in on it!
