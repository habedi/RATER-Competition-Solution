Driverless cars

The point that the article is making is that should we have cars that can drive themselfes, in my opinoin i would say no because it would cause so much disstortion and everthing would be in a heave of trouble. What we would be doing is we would be taking away jobs for people that live off of driving people places, or we would be spending so much money trying to make these cars, and also what would happen when the went out of control and no one could stop them then what would we do.

The idea of people losing jobs dosent sound right for me because i know how frustrating it is to lose many jobs and it isn´t easy. And something else what would stop those people who are mad and ticked at the idea that they just lost their jobs to a bunch of robots, that wont go so well because they will probably start rioting in the streets and that will just cause more of a problem´s for everone.

And also you would have to conceder on how much money they would have to spend to keep making those types of cars, it will probably cost millions of dollars for just one state. So they would be spending more money on making the cars than they would be getting so it seems that it would be a waste of time on what this idea has in store.

What other problems would happen if something went wrong with these cars like to say if someone missed up with the programming it could cause a lot of problems across the united states because so many car crashes would be happening, and that would bring so much panic through out the nation. so that is another reason why not to.

So what is the article stating is if we should have cars that control themselfs. there is to many if´s for me to say that we should like i can see that there are good parts to this like to say that we wouldn´t spend so much many on gas and it would be safer for the most part. But my answer is still no because we cant alwas y just think that since it is technology we are safe will that not alwas the case and we have to learn that. So no we shouldn´t have cars that drive themselves.
