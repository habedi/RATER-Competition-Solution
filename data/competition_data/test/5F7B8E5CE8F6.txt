I think that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it sound fun to try. It propaly sounds weird to some people at first, but i thought it sounded weird to. Who knows, you might end up liking it. Half of the people that read this probaly won't care but be the half that dose care. So, Let me tell you my reasons why you should try it.

First i think it is a fun oppratuinity to try. How often do you get offard this or even hear about it. Just like they said in the strory he couldn't say no because it was an opportunity of a life time. They said he traveled all around the world. I think that would be awesome and fun to try.

Next i think it would be fun to be around all of those animals. I understand that some people don't care about animals or anything that i have to say. I know some people get sea sick or are afraid of boats or sailing. I think that holds you back to much in life to have a fear like that. I think people should get out and try something new.

Last i think that it would be fun and exciting to travel around the world. To see all the sights and accient things. Even thought you have to be a ceartian age to do some stuff,well some stuff you don't need to be a ceartian age. I guess it depends on your udea of fun. But to say you have been there to something you see on TV or in the paper, would be cool when most of the people you know haven't.

Those are my reasons why i think it would be a fun thing to try. You get to see the sights and the animals. I hope more people take into consideration of trying something new most of the time. Even when your bord at your house just go outside and through a ball around with your parents. Just to go out and be active with your life.
