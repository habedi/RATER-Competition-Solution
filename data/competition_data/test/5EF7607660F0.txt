Are you ever bored when you get home from school? Do you have absolutelyÂ nothing to do? I think everyone feels like that every once in a while. Maybe some people feel like that everyday. Our principal only wants the absolute best for us and that's why our principal has made it required that everyone does an extracurricular activity. This is an enlightening idea because everyone can make new friends, extracurriculars' look amazing on college resumes, and you will be super productive.

First off, extracurricular activities should be required because everyone can make new friends. Sometimes it's hard to make friends at school; kids can be horrible. So, when you choose your extracurricular activity you will most likely choose one you enjoy. This will mean that you can make friends with many people who have the same interests as you. When you are put in social situations such as a team, you must talk to your teammates. This will improve your communication skills if you are shy or maybe have trouble making friends. Also, you can connect with your teachers or coaches that run your extracurricular activity. This will create a very optimistic and positive learning environment.

Secondly, extracurricular activities should be required because they look amazing on college resumes. Our principal wants us to exceed all expectations; then in the future be very successful with what we do. An extracurricular activity could help someone like you or one of your many friends get a scholarship into a thrilling and creative school like Yale or Harvard. By the way, colleges love to know that you are a critical and logical thinker. For example, if you did debate team it would tell the people looking at your college resume that you are a very strong minded person and you are fond of speaking in front of others. Those are both skills that may be important to different colleges. Although, you must make sure that you do an extracurricular you enjoy greatly and not one that you do just to put on college resumes.

Lastly, doing an extracurricular will cause you be to be more productive. Instead of laying down playing video games, you can be on a basketball team or help put together the school's yearbook. You can also get some exercise in with your friends. Exercise for anyone physically and mentally is so important so you don't lose skills. Whether it's practicing that perfect lay up or learning how to solve a gut wrenching math problem, everything takes practice.

Statistically speaking, doing social and physical activities can also improve your mental health. Rather than staying up late watching television you can embark on a wonderful book that will make you bursting with joy. Then, the next day at your book club you can share that amazing book; you can talk about how the princess saved herself because she doesn't need a man to save her.

Extracurricular activities are so important and should definitely be required. This is because you can make astonishing new friends, they look drop dead gorgeous on college resumes, and you will feel and be so productive while still having loads of fun. Extracurricular activities are easy and optimistic ways to brighten up your day. Although, it may be boring or hard at times, I can promise that they are the way to go. If you enjoy them a lot, you can sign up for more. Now the next time you are bored just remember you have extracurricular activities that can ensure fantastic experiences.
