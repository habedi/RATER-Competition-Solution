Having a car can get you places much faster than walking or riding a bike. But there's a price you pay either on gas or the co2 emisions coming from the muffler. It is extreamly bad for the planet and we need to take action. Reducing car usage will releive you and you wont be as stressed. In some countries they have a car-free day where millions of people ride the bus, hike or walk. Thats in BOGOTA, Columbia it is smart of them but its going to take a lot more to make a change for the best. (source 3:Car-free day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota)

Conjested cities are known to have smog and that is nothing but air polution. And all of that  polution isnt going anywhere. it stacks up causing a greenhouse effect and harming the air we breathe. But theres always going to be people driving cars unsless stricked rules are made up. we need to enforce that we only have one earth and everytime someone steps inside a car we are harming it. There are other means for transportation and we need to stop being lazy and carpool or take a taxi or bus and limit the emitions or else we are bound to doom ourselves in a co2 filled planet.  (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars)

But banning car driving can harm the economy greatly causing the unemployment rate to skyrocket because the car companies couldnt sell anything. And transportation keeps everything running throughout America and the world. So the greatest idea would be to create a car that doesnt burn up emitions and sends them out into the atomosphere. We couldnt just get rid or all cars because our world is dependent on them. but we should use them smarter and drive durng sertain times.

so all in all we should just keep on driving and do the best we can to stop all the air polution and try to make the world better for future genorations. and we just need to get smarter
