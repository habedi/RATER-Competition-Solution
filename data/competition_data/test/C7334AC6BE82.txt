Dear Principal,

I do not think that changing the policy that consists of having a grade B average in order to participate in a school sport is a good idea for a couple of reasons. These reasons are how sports can help a student learn cooperation with others, how much work a student puts into doing their best in school already, and how a grade B average is very high for some particular students.

First, a school sport can teach students how to get along with each other and helps them understand the importance of teamwork. Having a school team sport can help improve friendship between the pupils of a school. This could lessen the amount of arguments and fights that go on between the children. Also, teamwork is shown here by depending on each other to achieve something that everybody wants. Another reason that this school policy should be changed in because of the amount of time and effort a student may put into their school work after arriving home from a game or practice.

After school practices for a school sport are very important because it helps improve the team, but school work is just as important. When a child arrives home from a practice, they put all of their effort into their schoolwork. If 4 teachers were to assign a test for their classes all on the same day, then a student coming home from a late practice would not have the time to prepare themselves for an entire test that will be taken the next day. The student on the school team may not get much sleep either, which would be due to the amount of homework and studying they may have. Also, a grade B average can be shown as a challenge for some students.

As a student may struggle in school, then they may have a challenge in hand for them if they would like to play a school sport. A child that may be struggling in a certain subject may not have it as easy as everyone else may. If this particular child were to go in for help and still does not understand the material, then they may get a lower grade than normal. A grade C average also is not a bad thing, because a C means that their grades are average, and they are not yet below average or failing the subject. Obviously, changing this school policy is a big change and may effect many students.

In conclusion, a change in the grade average is a horrible idea. First, students can learn cooperation from a sport. Secondly, a child may have no time to finish their assignments at home. Lastly, a grade B average is high and some students may not be able to reach that. In conclusion, changing this rule is a bad thought.
