NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, because they want to find a solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. What is their solution? Their solution is trying to imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape, they are wanting to prove that if their jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude that can fly over many storms then a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.

They want to find the safest way possible so they can send people up to Venus since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. They have to find the right vehicle to get sent up to Venus because there is high pressure and heat that is like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Most people would just want to stay out of this and move on but astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

They are desperate to find a way to get this right and to actually be known for this. Going to Venus is not a easy task and researches have to take a lot of time into this. Most people are probably thinking why is it taking so long, well each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing like I said early, then this is an issue that leads up to why a spacecraft has not touched down on Venus. This is a very big deal and they just want to find the right research and the right system so they can go visit Venus successfully.
