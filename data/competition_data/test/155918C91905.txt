Dear principle,

Sports are important to many students life's. I think that students should not have to have a B average to be able to play a sport. If that was the case than i don't think that a lot of students would play sports because of their grades.

Sports have a major affect on many students lives, but if the grades have to a B average then i think it will disappoint many students.

In fact their wont be very many athletes in our school's sports because of their grades. Many of our games might be lost because all of the athletes will be sitting on the bench watching their teammate' s play the sport.

However if the school didn't have all of its player's then we would all look a bunch of fools because we wouldn't win as many games and we wouldn't have enough players to play certain schools. About 60 percent of our students all play a sport or even more than one sport. Therefore if the average had to be a B , then their would be less player's or a lot of hard working one's.

In my opinion I think that the average should at least be a C.A C is still above passing , so either way someone looks at it ,it is still passing .
