Dear TEACHER_NAME

My name is STUDENT_NAME other student's and myself have been not so happy with your decision on having at least a grade B average to play sports. Myself and a lot other student's average grade is a C. I think that is not the best idea for the eligible grade for sports. Students such as me need something to work for or to keep their grade up. Studies show that when a person is in a school sport, that the person wants to be in it makes the person work their hardest and get the best grades they can get. If you keep a chart and mark the grade down that people have in sports you will notice that it is high. But if you keep track of that person when their not on sports you will see their grade might be low. So if you let the grade average be a C for eligibility on sports it will give more students a chance of getting in that sport and keeping a high grade for that season. Thank you for taking your time to read this.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
