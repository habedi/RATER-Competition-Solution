The electoral college is flawed and in result, worthless. While being outdated and irrational, it is also unfair. Not only that, sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than to the kind we have now, as stated in source two. Election by popular vote can really show what president the people really want, not the slate of electors who pick and choose what benefits them most. The system is corrupted and the popular vote is crucial in progressing as a united nation.

The problems grow as we continue to use this outdated and irrational system. The voters simply can't control who the electors vote for, making it outdated and irrational. States that have the most population get the most attention when it comes to presidential campaigns. The smaller states get none of the attention. How will they know who to vote for? It makes the people feel as if their vote is worthless. This just proves that the system is irrational and corrupted. As stated in source three, "The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election". This is not true, swing states are the cause of people feeling disenfranchised. The campaigners focus their efforts in the swing states where voters will listen more closely, not in states where there is less people like that. It clearly isn't ideal for presidential campaigns to be like that. There is no variety. They should be explaining themselves to the people who know nothing about what they are gonna do for the people, instead of for the people who already know. This is why the electoral college needs to go.

Power to the people. Isn't that our countrys core principal? We are losing that right when it comes to voting. All we are doing when we vote is choose some group of people to vote for us. That isn't right; it's unjust. The people have a right to express their opinions and beliefs through the process of voting. Where do our votes end up? In the hands of greedy, power hungry electors who don't care about your opinions. As stated in source two, "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters". The votes people cast are worthless and can cause no change. "Abolish the electoral college", in source two.

The point is, the electoral college is outdated, irrational, and unfair. It also infringes on our number one right of freedom of speech. A popular vote cleanses the corruptness of the electoral system. This is why we need to thrive as a nation.
