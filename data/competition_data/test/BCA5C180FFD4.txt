If the principal would change the school policy some kids would tell their parents to let them go to a different school that allows atleast a c average to play sports or activities.

Then maybe the school principal well maybe not suggest the policy that she was thinking about doing and plan a different policy instead of changing the grade average to play a sport.

Then however if she did change the school policy maybe some kids might like having to try hard in their classes. But, the kids that don't want to try hard in their classes might not like that they have to get a b average in all classes to play a sport. Then so which is why they probably like the old policy better than the new one she is planning.

Then but maybe the kids could talk to the principal about making some rules up about trying to make the sport they want to join. Which would come as they needed to get atleast a c+ on each class to join for a sport and or pass every test they got or another one would be just try to get a b in each of your classes.

Next if would come down to what your principal thinks of the ideas you had given her to think about for the school policy she made up. Then you would need to honor those rules that you had suggested for her to make if she decided to make that policy.

Next i know some friends who have some b's and c's on their grade average. Then what would the principal do then she had to choose if it was good to play or not good enough that maybe you needed to get one more b.
