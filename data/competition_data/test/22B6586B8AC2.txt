Policy 1: I think policy one is better that we should be able to bring are phones to school because what if there's an emergency and we cant get a hold of are parents. I like texting all my friends because its like talking to him face to face but your not well that's how i feel and also sometimes when your finish with all your work you have to sit there and not do anything so if you brought your phone then you wont be bored and you can start texting your friends. Another cool thing is that when you have internet in your phone then you can get on your facebook or something you like to get on when you have internet. When i have internet i like getting on youtube and watch funny videos or fights. Phones can really entertain you when you know how to use them and also if you have lots friends then you can text them so it would probably be a lot better if we could bring are phones to school.
