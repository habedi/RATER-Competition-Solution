Some Schools offer distance learning as an option for students. I agree with this because is a good idea some student feel more better when they take class from home, in some school the student don,t feel good, and others sometime don't have the time to go to the school every days, students maybe in the home the have more private for focus and does the work because they domn't have distraction from other students.

Students sometime don't feel good in the school is the reason they feel more better take the class online from home because in the school never knows now in the school maybe will be dangerous some schools don't have sufficient security or polices. So the students feel more safe in the home.

Some students live lonely they no have the time for to go school in the morning because they need to work like they don't have a suport they are independient need money for maybe pay ther bills, classes online is someting good for people want overcome in they lifes and want abetter life in the future.

I think of some student need like private for focus more because in the school some student are distraction for other student some time students need a good consentration for make they work o take a tess, if the classes onlines a good thing for focus more some student choose this for pas the class an graduated.

In conclution the classes online are good for many thing this really help people in their life , for make thear dreams and finally can garduate an get a diploma and get a good job.

The class online is a good progran for help people really want graduated because in the school they no feel safe, or no have the time for go to the school for work .
