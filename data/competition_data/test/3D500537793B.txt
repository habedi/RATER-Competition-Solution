Can you imagine a time in the future when your driving a driverless car with your family or just you. When all of a sudden it malfunctions leaving you and your family critically injured or even worse dead.

Engineers have been working on perfecting driverless cars for many years. If we do get a completely driverless car, how much is that going to cost? Are they going to have to update the roads to keep up with the cars? Will everbody be able to afford this or just the rich? Were would all this money come from to pay for these roads, tax payers money. Putting all your trust and safety into technology and sensors to drive on their own, when anything can happen its not always 100% which could leave you or anyone else injured or dead.

The cars have these necessitates to alert the driver when its their turn to drive on situations required, but " wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?" specially if that person is drunk or high and had no idea what was going on. Their relying on the car to get home while they have no sense in the world, but if the car tells them to start driving and they don't its just a accident waiting to happen. I believe these driverless cars give these reckless people to be even more reckless.

So can you really put all your trust or even imagine a future with driverless cars knowing its not 100% guarantee or knowing that reckless people could be behind the wheel and is endangering you and your family. The road to autonomous car can stop , we don't need a car that can do everything we do by making assumptions.
