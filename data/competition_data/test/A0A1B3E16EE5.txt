World war II was the start of development centering cars but; in the recent years the popularity as well as the traffice has gone down because of limiting car usage which have lots of advantages. Limiting the use of cars advantages are less air pollution and new communities

Initially, less car usage means less carbon emissions which leads to less air pollution. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of " The End of Car Culture" wrote "If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the enviorment since transportation is the second largets source of America's emmisions...". Limiting the use of cars will have a really big benefit on the enviorment by stopping more emmisions from damaging the O-zone layer. For example in Bogota, Colombia they have a day called "Day Without Cars" and Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman who lives ther says "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." from "Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota" written by Andrew Selsky. People living there have seen the benefits of the limits on cars and thinks it's a really good thing for their cityand not even rain can stop people from participating says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.

Additionally, these limititations have created new communities by building places that are very easy to get to. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of "In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" wrote "In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away on a main street, Rather than in malls along some distant highway." With the new approach of limithing car usage things are built closer making many things accessible to everyone. For example, Andrew Selsky the author of "Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota" wrote "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions dramatically cut traffic; and new restraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.". With the changes of accessibility buissness owners have to come where the money is making everything more accessible and creating new things in the area. Building things closer attracts more people which means more homes being built and more families enoying the community.

Clearly, the advantages of limiting car usage is amazing because it means less air pollution and new communities. Limitations on car usage will benefit us and the world.
