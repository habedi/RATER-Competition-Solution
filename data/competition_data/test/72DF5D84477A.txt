Many students prefer to attend online classes to improve their knowledge. Why they choose online classes instead go to school everyday? There are many benefit and reasons they prefer online classes. Firstly distraction in classroom, students use to distract with others friends in class while the teacher is talking. Secondly the transportation is very important because a lot of students live far away from school. Finally taking online classes students get the same credit as taking the class inside the school.

In many schools, students have the option to choose online classes or classes in school. Firstly the benefit of taking online classes is students are able to do their work without distraction of their friends. For example, when the teacher is explaning the concept in the classroom some students like to talk and disctract others in classroom. However in online classes is only the teacher and there are not students distracting others in the class. Secondly students can ask any question about the concept of the class to the teacher. For example in class there is always something that students don't understand really well.

During the last decade students have been distractived with many king of technology like cellphones and video games on computer. But some schools also are taking advantage of this technology by offering online classes and creating opportinies to learn from home. Students can watch videos about explanation of classes on their phones. Basically this opportunity is helping many students give them knowledge and preparing them to the future.

The most important thing about online classes is that students get their credit as they were taking the regular class. Last year I had two option to choose, the first option was go to an academy to learn about marketing. The second option was take the online course from the academy. So this opportunity is great for everyone because students can improve their knowledge with online course and we still get the regular credit as we take the class in the academy.

Another benefit is in video conferencing the students can go back anytime they need in the video. In the other hand the students do not worry about transportation. Since many students arrive late to school they are not there when the teacher is giving the explanation to the class. Because the bus arrive late to school. In rural areas the schools are far away from the studen's home. So taking online classes they don't worry about it. Because all they need to do is log in their computer and to the class.

In conclusion, online classes is a great option to students. Studesnts get the same credit as taking the class in the school. Also there is not transportation to worry or the trafic to arrive late to school. Lastly there is not distraction in online class. Also the online class count as the regular class of the school. Finally there were some benefit that students get when they enroll in online classes.
