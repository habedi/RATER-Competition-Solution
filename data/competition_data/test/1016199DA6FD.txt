Some schools offer distance learning as an option from home by way of online or video conferencing. Allowing students to have an alternative option to distance learning is beneficial in many ways. Not only does it allow students to learn in a familiar friendly environment, it also allows them to form and adjust to their own schedule, and develop better sleeping habits and a healthy lifestyle.

Offering distance learning as an option for students allows them to learn in a familiar, safe, and amble environment. This can benefit students with issues in mental or physical health. It can also benefit students who want to experience learning outside of a traditional classroom. For example, Generic_Name, a third year high school student, has gone to public school for the majority of her school life. She has decided to take classes online at home for one year just to gain the experience. At home, Generic_Name feels like she is able to learn better because she is familiar with the atmosphere. Occasionally, she is able to go for a walk during her break which is something she wasn't able to do when she was in a regular classroom. Having her parents during the day, enables her to ask questions, discuss assignments, and other things they might want to discuss that day. Giving students an out of classroom learning experience allows them to gain better insight on the world around them, and gives solace and understanding of their atmosphere and surroundings. Similarly, Generic_Name is a fifth grader in primary school. His parents decided to enroll him in a video conferencing class with a one-on-one teacher. Generic_Name suffers from ADHD which limits his performance in the classroom because of his short attention span. Having a one-one one teacher allows Generic_Name to feel safe in his own home which can help prevent distractions and outside noise often produced in a noisy classroom. Students deserve to feel safe in any learning environment they choose to be in. Giving students the opportunity to learn at home can give them a sense of security and assurance.

Distance learning can also benefit students by giving them the opportunity to adjust to their own schedule. Students are occupied with numerous things outside assignments and tests. Allowing students to form their own schedule allows them to have time for sports, extracurricular activities, and self-care. For example, Generic_Name is a high school student who is involved with the band, debate team, and track. Normal school hours often tire her out because of the fast-paced, non-stop hustle. She decides to take online classes so that she can alleviate some stress. Her online classes allow her to have time for her assignments, while also giving her spare time to practice basketball and attend her extracurricular activities. Similarly, Generic_Name is a middle school student who is involved with a lot of activities outside of school. For one semester, she decides to take video conference classes that would last for about an hour three times a day during the school week. She is able to schedule her events around the time she needs to appear for classes. Students are taught responsibility and good time-management skills when they are giving the ability to form and adjust their own schedule.

Finally, another reason why distance learning can benefit students is it helps students develop a better lifestyle. Many students suffer from sleep deprivation and other health issues as a result of overworking and vigorous classroom expectations. Although working online doesn't deplete the consequences of overworking and challenging assignments, it gives students the ability to take breaks which can resolve burn-out and mental stress. Generic_Name, a high school freshmen, is involved with basketball and hockey. He often comes home late at night after practice and games. When he arrives, he is flustered with the amount of homework and studying he still needs to complete. Often, he finds himself getting a minimum of four hours of sleep before he needs to wake up and go to school. Giving him the ability to take classes from home allows him to develop a sleep schedule and finish assignments on time without the stress of worrying about his other activities. In addition, Generic_Name is also a a high school student who is involved with the music program at her school. She often finds herself coming home late after rehearsals and barely has the time to complete her studying and assignments. She's anxious and stressed about her school work which slowly begins damaging her performance in school and her mental health. If Generic_Name decides to take online courses as an alternative, she will be able to fit in school work around her schedule and also maintain her time for her music program. For some students, learning at home can benefit them by altering their sleep habits, and improving their overall lifestyle and well being.

While some may argue that distance learning by way of online or video conferencing doesn't benefit students, there are ways that it can help students improve their lifestyle and performance in their academics. Giving students the ability to attend school online can be beneficial to people with medical conditions that prohibit them from functioning in a regular classroom environment, can improve sense of responsibility, and can give students the ability to develop better liiving habits that can improve their overall well being.
