Should after school extracurriculars be required? How many days do you find yourself at home, wishing you were out playing football, but you didnt have a team, or needing help on your science homework, but your teacher wasn't there to help you? Extracurriculars can fix those problems becuase they offer after school sports, help from teachers, and many other fun activities. While they have many advantages, some students won't participate in fear they might not know anyone there, or because their friends aren't doing them. Schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can get you active, are socially beneficial, and can help you in school.

The first reason schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular is because it gets you active. Schools offer sports like basketball, football, and various other activities, and you can even be on a team! Being active is a very important factor in being healthy, and has many health benefits, like lowering risk of heart disease. After schools sports can also help you relax and have fun after a long day at school. School is seven hours long, and most of it is sitting and learning. After school, you can join sports clubs to get out all the energy you've been holding in all day, and have fun after all the stress of school. Sports and being active is also fun! You can do some simple layups, or play a whole game, it's up to you! Extracurricular sports clubs are helpful because they get you active and moving, have health benefits, and are enjoyable.

Additionally, after school clubs are socially beneficial. When you join a new club, you may not know everybody there, but you will make new friends. You will meet new, interesting people in after school clubs that you didn't know before. These new people could become some of your closest friends, and be super fun and cool to hang out with! You would already know something about them, which is a shared interest in the club you are both in. Meeting someone with similar interests helps to form friendships, and connections between people. You could also choose to do something with the friends you already have, like all joining a club and playing basketball together afterschool. After school clubs are socially beneficial because they help you meet new people, or hang out with close friends.

Finally, extracurricular activities can help you out in school. You could stay after for a study group to help you prepare for a big test coming up, or simply to understand the material better. You could also stay after with a teacher for a class you may be struggling with. Other struggling students would be there too so you wouldn't be singled out, and all of you can learn together if you are having similar problems. After school study groups can also give you time to finish your homework, and get help or guidance if you need it. As well as homework, you can work on projects in school that maybe you don't have the materials for outside of school. If you have a big art project in progress, you could stay after in art to work on it, to really give it your all, and make it the best it can be. An extracurricular study group is very helpful to your education, and has many benefits.

Extracurricular groups should be required because they are very beneficial to a students life. They help to get students active, social, and improve upon a students learing experience. I know that staying after school has helped me a lot. When I was struggling with a new unit in math I stayed after school to get some help from my teacher. After working on it for a little bit I could actually understand what I was learning. I wouldnt have understood it as well if I hadn't stayed for a study group to help me. I also know that i love sports, and staying after school for a sports club sounds like so much fun! Schools should require participation in at least one extracurricular activity because they increase your activity, benefit you socially, and help you in school.Â
