Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Deciding on the rules and policies for cell phones during school is a very hard decision to make.

I would say to let us be allowed to use our phone during free time and during lunch, just not during class.

Even though it may seem like it, I do not just say this because I am a student and it would benefit me the most.

I truly believe that if a student has a cell phone that they should be able to carry it with them at all times.

Now using the cell phone in class would be against the rules and you would have to make sure that teachers inflict punishment on students who break that rule.

Otherwise this new policy could become out of control.

The teachers would need to make a commitment to this and they would have to keep an eye out for kids using their phones during class.

This new policy would not add to much to that issue anyways.

A lot of kids use their phones in class already and never get caught.

So no matter what policy you pick you will always have kids still using their phones during class.

During lunch and any free time would be a good time to be allowed to use our phones.

What if there is the case where a kid forgot his or her lunch, shouldn't they be allowed to send their mom or dad a quick text saying they need their lunch or lunch money?

I know a lot of kids who don't eat lunch because they forgot it at home and don't want to go to the office, afraid that their mom or dad would not always answer to a call from the office.

The same case goes for forgetting homework at home.

A student should not get a 0 on homework that they truly completed but just forgot it at home.

Also another time a student might need a phone is if there is an emergency and they need to call home or 911.

Now this rule might cause more trouble with some students than others and there should be teachers or hall monitors looking for those types of students at all times.

Some of the phones might be stolen or lost or even dropped and then broken.

However, you should have the students and parents signing a form saying that you are not responsible for any lost or damaged phones.

Also make sure the students know what they could be getting themselves into if they chose to carry their phones around at all times.

To get a better feel for things you could take a vote from teachers and students on which rules or policies they would rather be chosen. Obviously it is easier to let students have their phones on them during school and to let them use their cell phones with permission or during free time.

I do think that with which ever policy you choose that you make sure those rules or policy is stuck to 100% by teachers and students.

Your Student,
