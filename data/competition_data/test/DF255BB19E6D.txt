Would you be satisfied with your school forcing you to stay after schoolÂ every day? What if you didn't have the time in your schedule to stay after school? It is a very unacceptable practice to trap people in school and force them to participate in activities after school ends. I believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory because they can increase stress in students and teachers, costs more money for labor, and wastes the students' precious time. It would be devastating if the school started to require students to take at least one extracurricular activity.

First and foremost, the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities would, in fact, induce plenty of stress in students and teachers. This is true because it creates more things that they have to worry about. In addition, increasing the required work time at school can also cause people to feel stressed out by increasing the amount of bullying that can occur. Not giving the students and teachers enough time at home to work can result in added worrying because they are now forced to suddenly improve in managing their time more than ever. School needs to be a safe and stress free environment if they want students to thrive later on in life.

Next, prolonging the period that a school is open for will most certainly increase the expenditure of money from the school. This is true because the school would need to pay the teachers more money to work for longer periods of time. The school would also need to pay more money for their bills due to the increase in used electricity and water. Another negative effect of this would be the fact that more utensils and other supplies would be used, resulting in the need to buy and replenish this supply more frequently. In addition, the school would also need to pay for better sanitation if the building is going to be in use for longer periods of time.

Lastly, making extracurricular activities mandatory would become a huge waste of time. This is because students and teachers have lives outside of school too. In addition, It is not morally correct to keep people in the school to force them to do activities against their will. I would also like to add that it is unlikely that the school would be able to provide every activity that would fulfill the needs of students. I believe this is true because each and every person has their own needs and it wouldn't be fair to keep them trapped in school if the school likely won't be able to provide with solutions to those needs.

All in all, I believe that after school activities should not be required because they induce stress, costs more money to pull off, and wastes the precious time that students have. Not convinced yet? Imagine not having time after school to participate in activities. Now imagine being forced to stay in school for an extra two hours. In addition, people would need to participate in these activities every single day. Schools cannot and must not make this rule a reality.
