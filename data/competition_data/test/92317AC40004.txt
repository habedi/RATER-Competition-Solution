The automobile is one of mankinds greatest innovations. Since its invention in the 20th century, it has made tasks such as commuting to work or visiting your friends simpler than ever. Just hop in your car and your gas-powered vehicle will have you there within minutes. Although they are handy, could too much of a good thing be a bad thing? In this case, I believe that this is true. Limiting car usage could have benefits such as easier and cheaper transportation and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

Imagine a world where public transportation (subways, trains, buses) could be accessed easier. Now look past the ways of modern life and cars we've become so dependent on. The growth of public transportation in places other than large cities could have huge benefits to the communities. Cars would not be relied upon and not as much money would have to be spent on gas. Of course people would still use cars to get from point A to point B but they would see public transportation as more of a go-to option. (Source 4) "Bill Ford proposed a plan of partering with telecommunications industries to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycles, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety." I believe limiting car usage would therefore raise public transportation usage and allow us to commute safer and cheaper than before.

Pollution has become an increasingly important problem in recent years. With all the craze over whether "global warming" is imminent or not, many have been trying to find ways to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. The United States holds claim to the invention of the automobile and also stands as one of the most car reliant countries averaging at least one per household. According to the text, passenger cars are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 1). Reducing that number by ways of carpooling, public transport, and hybrid cars, would benefit our society and help to protect the world we live in for future generations. For example, (Source 2)after days of intensifying smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city one Monday. Motorists with even-numbered plates were told to leave their cars at home or face a $31 fine. In just one day, car traffic was down 60 percent with less people driving and the smog cleared enough to lift the ban for odd-numbered plates the next day. In Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar, Colombia a similar experiment was put to test where there was a full Day Without cars. This plan promoted alternative transportation (bicycles, walking, taxis, buses) and helped to reduce smog. A local businessman from Bogota saw the day as beneficial and states that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." (Source 3)

Although modern lifestyles have become overly dependent on cars, usage can be reduced and have many benefits to our society. While this would be a process that would no doubt take years to accomplish globally, I believe that it is very possible and likely that limiting car usage would lead to easier and cheaper transportation, and fewer greenhouse gas emissions or pollution.
