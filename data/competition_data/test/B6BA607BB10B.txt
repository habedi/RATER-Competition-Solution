I participated at a Seagoing Cowboys Progam and changed a lot of lives and you should to. On the job you will have to take care of animals. You will get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. You will get to help other people in their countries and their needs. You can also help countries recover if you participate.

You should also participate because it can change your life as it did to Luke Bomberger. In 1947 I had made nine trips and was the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy. Caring for animals during the crossing keeps you busy depending how far your destination is and how much time it will take to get you there. It helps make you more aware of the other peoples countires and their needs.

In your spare time there you can do some fun stuff. Such as playing baseball, volleyball games, boxing, and more. You can also sight see on your spare time. It was one in a lifetime opportunity for me to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion you should be a Seagoing Cowboy because it not only changes others lives but also yours. It made me more aware of other people in their countries and their needs. It took me through a lot of adventures. It opened up the world to me.
