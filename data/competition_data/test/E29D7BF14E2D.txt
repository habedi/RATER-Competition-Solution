I think he will want others to try the Seagoing Cowboys program to maybe experience life more. I will want others to attend the program because I want some of you to see more unique places. I think others will like to go and take care of some of the animals and see more nice places. i will like other to help people of other countries and their needs.

I turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant i could be drafted for military service. I arrived August 14 the day the Pacific war ended. I also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me.

I think others should just do thing you never did before. Some people like to take care of animals, people, and have jobs to do. I think it was nice i got to do things for people i got a change to see more things and places and i got to have fun with the other cowboys. I think other should try band learn more things and help others.
