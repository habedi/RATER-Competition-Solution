Dear Principle,

I think that you should require all of the student body and your self perform community service. I think this because everybody should be willing to help our homes and town. This could help us. first we could get publicity and we will be good neighbors even make friends, Second we could all get active, Third it will help our environment, Last when were helping we could also be having fun.

First, if we all get out there and help I'm sure you will meet a lot of new people. Even make friends also you can make a good reputation for yourself. If we all get together and help eventually you will have tons of friends and partners in life.

Second, Every one complains about weight issues. If everyone got out there and helped work they/you will loose body fat and get muscle. So you would be helping the environment and also get a size 6 waist. Or if your a boy/man you can get the body of your dreams by getting out and helping. This will help the world and help you at getting a date.

Third, Everyone at one point wants to help animals. Well if you/we do community service you/we would be picking up trash and other things. Animals eventually eat trash and choke on it and die painfully. If we got all of the trash up then animals would be not dying for that reason. Also planting trees and flowers will help the environment, animals, and you/us by giving us oxygen and by making soil easier to grow in and by giving animals food and/or places to live.

Last, you could be cleaning out your favorite lake or pond that can be fun if you love the water. Or clean up your favorite place to play outside. I'm sure you at least have one.

In conclusion community service is a good thing it can help you, your body, the environment, and animals. That's why (principle) you should let us do community service.
