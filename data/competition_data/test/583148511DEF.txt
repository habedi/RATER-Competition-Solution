Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I am making this argument based on the fact that you are willing to change the schools policy so that way us students may not be capable with participating in any school activities unless we have a B average grade. I do believe that you should not change anything because of the fact that most of the kids here don't care bout there grade as much as I do and that's putting a affect toward my fun time.

i am trying my best to succeed in all of my subjects but just because of the fact that you are not satisfied with the other kids behavior and their grades i do not think that you should take out all of you anger on the kids that are actual good students but their class work just might not be on point as the other kids. I just really hope you take as much time as you need to think this through because most of the kids would be mad well at least the ones that care the most. This is really a great opportunity to consider doing what you doing but i also think you should let us all sit down with you and the president, state treasure, and vice president of us kids and have a meeting just to discuss your decision. I think that would only be fair for us the kids because even though you are grown lady i completely understand that but u would also have to take time out and realize that i takes a lot of effort and work to change the school policy.

Thank you for your time sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
