Cell phones are an important part of the 21st century. Many people don't leave their house without one. Over the years, cell phones have evolved so now people can not only call someone from almost anywhere in the world, they can text message them, play games, use the internet, listen to music, and even watch television. But cell phones still have one main purpose: communication. Sometimes, that communication comes in handy or could even save your life.

As for in school, there are situations when using a cell phone would be inappropriate, of course, but there are so many more when it could be necessary. What if a student's bus broke down on their way home from school, and they had no way of reaching their parents? The parents would be very worried when their child didn't come home at their usual time. With a cell phone, they could be informed of the delay immediately and arrange for a pick-up or make appropriate considerations for the time delay.

Or what if the child were to be in danger? Going to school, while in school, or coming home from school, anything could happen. Contacting a parent or the police could save lives. Or on a more simple level, if a teacher needed to contact a child's parent or other adult, chances are the child has all the necessary contact information on their phone. Addresses, phone numbers, schedules, nearly anything can be accessed from that little device.

Cell phones are also important for scheduling after-school activities. Many times, at the last minute, a friend has invited me over after school, and I've had about 2 minutes to get permission and make a decision. Calling my mother took only a few seconds. If I hadn't brought my cell phone to school those days, I would have missed out on many fun times. Also, while on the bus, sometimes I get separated from my friends, and have no one to talk to. My phone is my entertainment for the 15 minute ride.

And while students are in school? Cell phones generally aren't a problem. If a child knows the phone may be confiscated if they have it out during class, they won't take the chance. Those phones will be off and away. However, cell phones can encourage communication between students during times like lunch and other free time. What harm could a mere cell phone do in between classes or during down time? Minimal. They could do much more good than bad, including contacting parents for forgotten papers or just for keeping them updated in their child's life.

In conclusion, banning cell phones from school would do more harm than good. Cell phones are so useful in a number of situations including on the bus, during down time, or after school. Students need their cell phones.
