Most people you see cleaning up the community are people who have gone to jail or there told they would have to clean to do community service. Doing community service will not only help out the environment, but it helps out with the community as well.

Every kid would not want to spend there day cleaning the community, they would rather stay at home and do nothing, but not all kids are like that. Those other kids would rather help out our community than have litter everywhere an live in a garbage dump. I think it would be better if kids did help out an clean because it will give them an opportunity to give back to the community an do something right for a change. Kids who do get into trouble, this can help them to stay out of all that trouble. Cleaning up will also look good for the community, it will look more attracting and would make people want to go there. It would also help with the pollution.

Telling kids at a young age to pick up trash can help prevent this. Even though kids would rather not do community service, I think it would be good for them. Doing so, this would help the kids stay out of trouble and keep people knowing that they live in a clean community an we still have some kids helping out the community.
