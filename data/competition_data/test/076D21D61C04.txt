Dear Principal,

I believe that students should not have a B average to compete in sports or other activities.

A reason is since many of the students have a grade C average, it could be hard for them to catch up. Another reason is that the activities are there so the students could have fun.

Lastly a reason is that the students without a grade B average could feel left out.

A reason why the students should not have a B average to compete is that since most students have a grade C average it could be hard for them to catch up.

It could be even harder if they are not good at the subject.

So if there is mostly everyone in school with a grade C average. then there will be less people in the sports and other activities.

But I think the principal wants more people in the sports and other things.

Another reason why the students should not have a grade B average is because the sports and activities are there so the students could have fun.

But if a lot of students do not have a grade B average not a lot of people will go.

So the principal will not like that either.

If the students do not have fun they might not even come after school.

So there might to even be a sports team.

Lastly a reason is that the students without a grade B average could feel left out.

They might not like it.

So they might not hang out with people who have a grade B average.

So they would eventually not have as much friends.

They could also hate the other people who have the average.

They could not even participate anymore in school.

So those are some reasons why students should not have a B average to participate in school activities.

It could be hard for them to catch up, the sports and activities are there so students could have fun, and they could feel left out.

From,
