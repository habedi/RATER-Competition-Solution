The Facial Action Coding System is a major benefit to the psychology community. This program could be as, if not more beneficial to public schooling systems worldwide. Using this program in public school systems would help all teachers, especially psychology teachers, and school counselers alike while also helping to prevent potential tragedies. Based off the information presented in the article, this program is a useful learning tool benefiting both students and teachers be more productive. Using technology to bolister class productivity is a no brainer on whether or not this program should be inserted into public school systems.

Teachers are constantly put in a position where they have to guess whether students are understanding their lesson or not. Everyone learns in different ways and it can be trying on a teacher to know wether or not they reached the whole class or not. In the article, Making Mona Lise Smile, it is said that Dr. Huang believes "A classroom computer could recognize when when a student is becoming confused or bored." He then continues to say how this program could help a teacher modify his or her lesson to meet the needs of as many students as possible. This makes the program very helpful to teachers striving to keep students both engaged and learning. A student may be engaged by a teachers presentation, yet not understand what the material being presented means. It could also tell if the teaching stategy is working for select students but not reaching out to many other students. If the prgram was used to see what teaching method keeps students productive and reaches the largest portion of the class, the teacher could adjust their teaching strategy accordingly to meet the needs of the student. Using this program could make class more insightful and more entertaning, which is a win for both students and teachers alike.

This program would be very useful in specific classes that require face to face interaction to help teach students. One such class this particular program would be useful in would be a psychology class. If young psychologists could learn from this device when people are faking a smile or if a person is sad it would be very beneficial to their future careers. The article states the program can identify a fake smile by the rasing of the zygomatic major, which begins at the cheekbones, to tell if a celebrity or politician is faking their attitude. Using the program to study what is real and what is fake could help psychologists treat patients correctly. Learning how to do this at a younger age in school would be a tremendous help rather than learning on the job by opinion.

It is impossible to predict when tragedy could strike, but it is possible to limit its frequency. In the year 2018 there have been a reported eighteen school shootings thus far in the first two months. Many of these were performed by misunderstood students who needed help but didn't recieve the help they needed or people were blind to it. If this program was implimented into school systems it might be able to catch depression and treat it before it got out of hand. The author states the program can detect both sadness and anger in an individual. If students are required to use the program before and after school everyday in order to gather data on how a student is feeling, the school could see if a student is frequently depressed. It's normal for a student to be sad or angry on occasion, but if a student has been recorded as sad or angry for muliple weeks this program could get them the help and couseling they need. The article states just forcing a smile can make people happier and that the program can detect fake smiles. Even if a depressed student is faking a smile to try to avoid detection these features could tell who is faking smiles and thus making the individual a little bit happier in the process by trying to smile. School shootings are a terrible tragedy, but if this program could help stop these horrific occasions it should be used in school systems.

Based off information presented in the article along with my key arguments this program should be installed in every public schooling institution in America. Any device that can benifit a students learning experience while making teachers lives easier should be available to schools systems for educational use. This device can prepare future psychologists to be better at their proffesion while also helping students get the help they need. A device that not only helps students learn and prepare for the future, but also could potentionally save lives should be necccesary in public school systems across the United States.
