I think  free car cities would have ups and downs. its downs would be not having quick transportation and waiting for public transportation. its ups would be saving money on gas andglobal warming would start to decrease. if this does happen i would like it very much.

In todays world car companys are starting to build eletric cars to eventually to stop making cars that run on gas to be eco friendly. also not having  cars would not be to intellgent because how would over 5,000 to 7,000 people get to work everyday by bus or taxi or train it would be a nightmare. After all that they all have to take the same bus home. It would be absoulte caios in the city nobody would no what to do with out cars.

The good part of not have cars is that people would get tko save money becuase there not speanding it on gas. Also the the traffic would go down beause theres no cars on the road. Personally i dont think car free citites would work like people think it would everybody woul have to ride in public transportation and that would be like a war because everybody would be fighting for seats. it might work for the first two weeks but after that it would be awful.

The bad part about have no ars is finding ways to get from point A to point B because everybody would be using transportation and the other half of people would be walking. so the buses would be crowded and the sidewalks would be very busy.  I think cars should be in all cities, but there cars should be eletric not running on gas. after that the car companys should make eletric buses so everything would be eco friendly.

Finally after my opinion on car free cities i came to conclusion that i didnt agree with this topic beacuse with out cars people would be crowding the streets and it would be hard to get round by walking becuase the streets would be packed. Since my opinon is strong my argument would win and pople would agree that car free cities would not work like people think it would.
