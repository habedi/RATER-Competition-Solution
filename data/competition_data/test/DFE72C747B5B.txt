For most students, summer is the best time for students to relax and release the stress that they endured during the torturous school year. However, some students are required to complete summer projects to make sure the knowledge that they have attained from those nine or ten months of school doesn't leak out of their brains. This is not a bad thing because it allows for teachers to know what they should focus on for the new year when these students come back. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the summer projects will be graded by teachers, teachers already have the knowledge about the curriculum, and students will be too lazy to want to design a project for their summer.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because, in the end, teachers are going to be the ones grading it. Grading things, often, take a lot of time from teachers. However, the time it takes to grade could change by the subject that the teacher is grading.

For example, a math teacher could take two or three days to grade all of their students' math tests. On the other hand, English teachers could take a week to a month to grade essays for all of their students. Projects take a long to do because the purpose is to see what the student knows overall and allow them learn things they didn't know before. Teachers are going to grade these projects at the beginning of the year, but they are also expected to begin teaching students new information of the course and grade other things assigned to put in the grade for first quarter. It would be stressful for the teacher if the students were able to design a project that would barely passed the minimum effort expected or if the students design a project that far and beyond. It would be a chaos for teachers to grade. Therefore, teachers should be able to design a project that they believe would allow them to efficiently grade at a faster pace.

The people that should design the summer assignments are the people that know the subject of the summer projects the best and those people are teachers. It easy to say that designing a project is easy. However, it's difficult to find the resources and plan out a project that would effectively help new students learn the information they need for the new year. It will be difficult for new students to make a project on what they don't know. Teachers, on the other hand, know about the subject and the important things that students should focus on. They know websites, videos, movies, documents, or other resources that are helpful to students. For example, I had an AP United States summer project that I had to do in the summer of 2019. The teacher give us YouTube links to watch from and made us practice how to write different types of essays. The project wasn't boring. It taught people a lot of useful skills by allowing them to watch videos and reading sources. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. This example shows that teachers already have the information to make a good summer project that allows new students to learn effectively.

Honestly, students are too lazy to want to design a project. If a student is too lazy to do a summer project, why would they want to make a summer project that will be source of their suffering and anxiety for the summer? For example, I had an English book that I was suppose to read in the summer of 2018. I did not even read a page in that chosen book. It was the easiest summer project ever and I was too lazy to even do that. Students want to have fun during their summer. They don't want to design a project for their summer. People could argue that designing a project is fun or if a student designed a summer project then they could make it be easy. However, the project will never be truly "student-designed' because teachers and schools will have a requirement of what is suppose to be on the project that students will be designing. Also, summer projects are for new students. These new students know nothing to very little information about the new subject that they will be taking for the upcoming year. If teachers or the school expects students to do research on the subject to make their summer project. They might as well just make their own summer project because either way the student is gonna be force to learn something new. It will only be more work for the student to design a project for the summer that they will have little information about or they won't even be able to do it because they won't be in the class next year.

In conclusion, teachers should be the ones designing summer projects because they know the most about the subject, they're going to grade these projects, and students are too lazy to design a project. People can argue that a student can still design a summer project and make it enjoyable, even with teachers' requirements. However, it would be so difficult for teachers and students because teachers will be forced to make requirements of what should be on the summer project and be forced to see if the summer project is effective. Students will be forced to make a summer project for new students and not for them because they're going to move to a different grade or subject the next year. Unless new students are making it. However if new students make it, they won't even know what are the important things that should be on the project or how to most effectively gather the information. It'll be too difficult, therefore teachers should just design the projects themselves.
