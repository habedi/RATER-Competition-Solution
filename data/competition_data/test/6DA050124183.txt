School is a seemingly never-ending obligation that constantly demands the attention of students all across the nation. Since school is so demanding, missing a day of school could severely harm one's education. If a student misses a day of school, they could miss a key lesson that would have prepared them for a test. Missing school can be unpredictable. A student could wake up sick one morning and not be healthy enough to go to class. Although, if a sick student felt healthy enough to go to school but was still had an illness, the school could deny the student from entering the school for fear that the student could accidentally spread theirÂ sickness. However, there are students that simply do not go to school. They may believe that school is a waste of time for them. There are schools that offer distance learning. This provides students the ability to attend a class from their home through a video conference or online connection. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Distance learning would give students another way to become educated by their teachers as well as lessen the issue of students missing school.

Distance learning provides students more opportunities to learn. If a student can't make it to school, they could attend their class on a laptop or tablet and still receive their deserved education. In some cases, students can learn more efficiently while in the comfort of their own home. The school may be a huge distraction for a student. Sometimes, other students in a class can pull another student's attention away from the material that they should be learning. There are others that prefer to work alone and learn faster by themselves. If a student is falling behind in a subject because they can't work as well in a classroom, they would benefit from attending their classes from home. Allowing students to attend classes from home would increase the opportunities for students to receive the education they deserve.

Giving a student access to attend their class even while being sick would be extremely beneficial for that student's learning. Sickness is a major reason why kids in school fall behind. When someone is sick, depending on what illness they obtain, their body needs plenty of time to recover. No one should push themselves to go to school if they feel unwell. However, if they feel like they have enough energy to learn but are still to contagious to attend the classroom, they could attend their classes online. This provides the student time to recover from their sickness and receive learning. A student could also be involved in a car accident or an injury that prohibits the students from walking. Instead of just staying home and missing out on their classes, they could join their class through a video conference and be able to receive their teaching. Offering distance learning to students who cannot attend class would heavily benefit their lives.

Some might say that distance learning would not be beneficial for students who do not wish to attend school and accept the education that they deserve. They might say that allowing students to attend their class from home could lead to some drawbacks. Since there are students who simply do not wish to attend school, they could abuse this privilege. Instead of being required to come to class, they could join online and use the comfort of their home as a distraction. They could be on their cellphones at home and act as if they are listening to the teacher over a conference call. Others might also say that distance learning is not an efficient way for kids in school to learn. Teachers would have more responsibilities and therefore a higher chance of more stress. Students would not have the same teaching experience at home than if they were at school. To others, distance learning could not benefit students.

Students can benefit from being able to attend class from home. All students deserve an education, whether they are at school or at home. Distance learning can provide kids in school with extra opportunity to gain the learning they deserve as well as benefit those who cannot attend a classroom.
