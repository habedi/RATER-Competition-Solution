In my opinion i really believe that its a great idea to have driverless cars because they are more safer then an original car. In the text it says that these cars have driven more than half million miles without a crash. And yes they are expensive but still yo can save up om money or even get a good job to buy one im sure you can get it from somewhere cheaper. These computer driven cars are also great for people that have injuries such as a broken leg or even people who cant drive. You can drink and dont have to worry about getting into a car crash.

In the text it asked why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Well thats not the case. either way it goes you will need someone to ride in the car because how do you exspect to go to your location? if you needed to go to the docter and you didnt feel like driving then here your driverless car that will drive you there for you. Get it now?

So yes i beileve that this driverless car is worth it for the people who dont like to drive but always busy or people who cant drive or even people who are injured. im not saying everyone dont like to drive but i know people who dont like do drive. I even heard people say that they wished they had someone who can drive them places for them. Im not even driving yet and i beilve that this driverless car is something important that people should buy.
