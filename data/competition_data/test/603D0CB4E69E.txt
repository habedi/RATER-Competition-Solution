Has televison and movies been showing us the future this whole time? Why showing us the future you may ask well there has been talk about driveless car or self driven? Google has had self driven car since 2009 their car have driven more than half of million miles with out any crashes. Now how will this benifit us and cause problems to other people. What will be the main source that keeps the car running such gasoline,solar power,electric. Self driven car will cost moe than you're normal avarge car that uses gasoline.

There is good thing about the self driven car, but do these changes really matter? If all of us decide to switch over that the self driven car will it run on gasoline like the car that we have today. If they didn't that would destroy other countires that sell potrolium and that would lead them to lower the price and workers won't get paid as much and many work will end up losing their job. Self driven cars aren't all that self driven because they need to be driven when there is construction or a accident. Most big states don't allow the self driven car. Beaucse if someone gets injured or even killed who will be the one taking the responsibility the drive or the manufacture?

Google has not put a exact price for the self driving car but what i think they are going to be around 50k U.S dollars that with it being solar power and self driven. Maybe Google will partner up with big car companies and make something work like Chevy or Kia. I have many questions about the car like the miles it get on the highway and how many miles it gets in the city. What technology will the car have how many people can fit in the car and whats its top speed. All of these questions you and I have we will just have to wait and see when Google decids to release more information about the self driven car.
