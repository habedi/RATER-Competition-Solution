Compared to the past, school is highly encouraged for children to attend. School is a basic necessity that everyone needs to be successful in everyday life. With schools improving their technology yearly, online school and video conferencing has become a way for all children to obtain the education they need and want. Advancing schools to offer online school options increases the amount of kids getting a decent level of education. Schools offering distance learning highly benefits students because it gives opportunities for children who can't attend school for medical reasons, helps children who travel during the school year, and allows for students to have more time for extra circulars.

Sometimes, many children aren't able to attend school because they physically can't go. Some children may be in hospitals with a severe illness or may be at home resting after a surgery, which removes their presence from school. Missing school causes kids to leave out the education they could be receiving and increase the amount of time needed before they can graduate from high school. Kids who go through the experiences of needing medical care can't do anything about it because ultimately, their health is more important. With schools offering online classes, students can learn the same material everyone their age is without falling behind or missing out. In my county, students who aren't able to go to school for medical reasons have the option to apply for online school. Kids are able to catch up on their school work and obtain the education they need to graduate and go to college while they are at home healing. Attending classes online, removes interruptions in a school classroom a student might have because of their specific schedule created for their medical needs.

Today, most children and teenagers miss school because of the amount they travel. Some kids grow up in military families, causing them to move around frequently, leading them to miss school. The extra amounts of time they spend traveling to a destination, they could be receiving an education. These students have to transfer to many different schools and have to adapt to new environments of learning. This can highly affect kids by providing a harder time to not only get use to a new area but also get use to a new school with new people. For some, this may not be a problem, but for others this interferes with their ability to grow as a student. In addition to children raised in military families, many students have to travel for family reasons, such as having divorced parents or having to visit family overseas. Sometimes their plan for traveling can be unexpected as well. Giving these students the ability to learn from a distance can put their traveling to an ease by not having to worry about the missing work they need to finish.

Not only does distance learning benefit children who are traveling, but also for students who have another life besides being a kid. In today's society, teenagers and children have the desire to be social media influencers. By releasing images or videos of everyday life and activities into the public, everyone has the opportunity to become famous on a social media app. With this publicity they are asked to travel to many media events. These events cause children to miss school in order for them to attend. Having online school or video conferencing for these children, can have them doing what they enjoy doing while still getting the education everyone their age is getting. This goes for famous musicians and actors as well. For example, Shawn Mendes is a young singer and songwriter well known for the music he produces for teenagers. In order for him to pursue his dream, he needed to quit school and get his education from online school. By doing this, he was able to go on tour and focus more on his career while doing school wherever and whenever he was able to. Online school gives him and many other famous people the chance to receive a higher level of education without attending a school building every day.

Overall, everyone needs to receive a school education in order to have a job or specialize in a certain career. With today's technological advancements, attending classes online and video conferencing is an option that is offered in many school systems. This benefits students who aren't able to go to school because of medical issues, support kids who travel many times during the school year, and boosts education for students who don't prioritize school as much as others do. The availability of virtual school enables students to gain knowledge and strive for success without going to school every day, increasing the amount of children receiving an education.
