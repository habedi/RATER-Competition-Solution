I do think that we should have a Facial Action Coding System for everyone. You could use it for so many things. Sometimes you could be in a situation for someone and you wnat to know how they are actually feeling. This would also be a very helpful tool cause you wouldn't have to use it on just paintings you could use it on humans too! You could also probably use it on yourself.

It would be so much easier to tell how people are feeling with this. Sometimes people get annoyed at others so this can tell you to either leave them alone or stop what you are doing. You could use other emotions as well like if someone is feeling down you could do something to make them happy. If you where doing an essay on renaissance paintings this could help with that. To me some renissance painting look like they are showing no emotion at all. Then with this tool you could know how they afre feeling more and you can understand the painting more.

This is such a good tool. I hope that they can let the world experiene it. I know it would be helpful for some of the people that I know including myself.
