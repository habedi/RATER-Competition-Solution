Learning efficiently is one of the most important things a student can do during their time at school. Although, for some students, learning at school may seem like a hindrance to their ability to learn. Some students learn their best alone with no one their to put them off task. Taking classes from home offer multiple benefits such as: the comfort of their own home, less distractions from outside sources, and the benefit of learning at their own pace.

Making sure the student is comfortable is one of the most important things a school can do to ensure the student feels safe and secure. While schools do try their best to stay up to date with the latest furnishings to ensure the comfort of their students, it is not always enough. Sitting and a desk on hard chairs is not for everyone, and some people just want something that is more comfortable and more inviting. For some people this will vastly increase their productivity; allowing them to increase their learning capabilities and possibly finish tasks quicker. However, this is not the case for everyone. Some people will not be able to get anything done because of the comfort, and it may completely distract them from the task at hand. Personally, I have seen a direct relationship between comfortabilityÂ and productivity in my experience. Based of this I believe and increase in student comfort by learning from would be very beneficial towards the student's overall experience.

Minimizing distraction has always been a major issue at schools around the world. While some of these distractions, such as outside interference and noises from other classrooms, are avoidable, others are not. These distractions include: disruptive students, uncomfortable surroundings or simply the chairs. No school wants to have these distractions taking place, but some of the are just unavoidable. This is why taking a course online from home allows the student to personally minimize these distractions by taking their own prefrences into account. In my experience as a student, I have seen the destructive nature of distractions in a classroom and how they can completely derail the entire lesson for the day. At home the student would not have to worry about this destructiveness and can give their complete attention to the lesson instead of it being constantly due to these distractions.

Every student has their own, personal pace at which they learn. This can cause an imbalance in classrooms, due to the fact that some students learn slower and some learn faster. This can severely interfere with each students learning and can be a huge road block for some. To combat this, schools have created classrooms with multiple levels of learning that allow the students to learn at a different pace. This is a very helpful thing schools have added to aid in their students in learning. Although this in not always enough. Sometimes students would rather to learn at home where they can constantly adapt to their learning pace. From what I have seen, some people are just much better and faster at learning on their own time and pace, which is why I believe that it is beneficial for the student to learn at home

Learning at home creates an entirely new environment for the student to learn in the comfort of their own home, devoid of distractions, and at the pace they deem fit for efficiency. School should allow students the option of learning at home, if the student believes it would increase their learning abilities. This could be a major improvement for schools, especially with all the new technology that is now coming into play around the world. The only major downside of allowing students the choice of learning at home is whether they can be trusted to complete their lessons and really retain that information. In the end, however, the student often enough has an idea of what is best for them, but not always. This why schools have councilors, so that the students can receive free help with choices whenever they choose. Based on previous knowledge, Learning at home is sometimes just the better alternative for some students to vastly succeed in life.
