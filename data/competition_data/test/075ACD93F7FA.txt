Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that you shouldn't make community service mandatory because some people don't want to do it ,or they don't have enough time to do it. If you make it mandatory some students might get mad and ask their parents to switch schools. Also some students are involved in other clubs, sports, or organizations. If you make them do community service then they might miss meetings or practice then get kicked off the team. Again if students get kicked off a team they might get mad and ask their parents if they can switch schools. If some students want to go do community service then that's good for them ,but its not right for everybody to have to do it. If you let students who do community service get rewards ,such as, an ice cream or pizza party then more people might do community service. Also if you give special field trips on a weekend to go to the beach to clean up litter. That would get me to do community service so I think it would get other students too. So those are my reasons why I think you shouldn't make community service mandatory.

Sincerely,
