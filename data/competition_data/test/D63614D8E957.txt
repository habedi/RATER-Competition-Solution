In 1976, a remarkable natural landform was discovered on Mars, a land form known now as, The Face. Scientist have debated on whether The Face is a natural landform or created by an ancient civilization on Mars. I believe this is really just a natural landform, and the reason I believe this is because of recent evidence. Reasons why I support this are, in 1976 picture quality wasn't as advanced as it is today and, this rock formation is similar to ones that occur on Earth.

The Face, a huge rock formation, at nearly two miles long. This face like formation is also known as Cydonia. Cydonia in the mid 70's was thought to be a strange landform built by aliens. Although, really it's like any other naturally occuring landform on Earth. According to the artical "Unmasking the Face on Mars," "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." In the new updated picture of The Face, it is clearly seen as a land formation, not done by aliens.

Then in 1976 picture of Cydonia was not as advanced as it is today. In the 2001 pictures, "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo." This quote from paragraph 10 explains that, the picture power was very noticable different in the photograph from 1976 than 2001. This means that the pictures from 1976 are not reliable because of the poor pixel quality. Proving that The Face is just a natural landform.

On April 5th, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor traveled to Mars and flew over Cydonia for the first time. These photos were said to be "...ten times sharper than the original Viking photos," according to the artical.

So on that day in 1998 people tuned in to find out the real truth. A quote from paragraph 7 in the artical states, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitng when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform." In the end, it turns out that there was really no alien monuments.

In conclusion, my claim is that The Face is just a naturally occuring landform. First, are Earth landforms that are similar, called mesas. Next, pictures took in 1976, are outdated and have poor pixel quality. Lastly, since April 5th, 1998 there are pictures proving that The Face is just a natural landform. Therefore making my claim true, The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform.
