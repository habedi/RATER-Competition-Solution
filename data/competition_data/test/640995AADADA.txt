HI, I'm Luke and im part of the seagoing cowboys program. It's really fun and exciting too. I think you shoud try and join because it may be dangerous but it really is fun. We need more people to join! Would you want to join us on our adventures?

Our ship is really cool too! We're almost like pirates in a ship on the sea. We get to go to so many new places as well. I've been to Greece, New Orleans, the Panama Canal, China, and different parts of Europe. You always hav time to have fun too when your on board or off board. We play vollleyball, baseball, and table tennis. We also fence, box, read, whittle, and play games just to pass the time. This is an opportunity of a life time!

Trust me you dont want to miss this! I love this place and have made many friends on it. You will have so much fun too! I hope i see you here one day! I hope you will like it too.
