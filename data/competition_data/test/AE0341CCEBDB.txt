I think brining cell phone to school is great. Also using your cell phone during lunch is not a good idea because after lunch the student are not going to want to put there cell phone away. I think it better if student turn off there cell phone and keep them in there locker. One reason is because if your in class using your cell phone and your taken a test you could be cheated with the a other person in your class. Second reason is because with your cell phone you can be taken picture of other people during class. Cell phone is not bad to take to school is good to because you never know what can happen. A other thing about bringing cell phone to school is that during class while the teacher is teaching the student don't like to listen and that when the teacher get mad. I think that the policy should be you can bring your cell phone to school but if you keep it in your locker. If i was a teacher and a student is playing with there cell phone i wouldn't get mad. I will just take the cell phone away. Some student keep there cell phone in there jacket and they don't turn the volume down and during class there cell phone start ringing in class. I
