Distance learning has recently become a widely used feature of learning due to the technology advancements that make this possible. In the past decade, technology has advanced to make it possible for wide range online calls and even clear image video conferencing. School systems have taken advantage of this type of technology by allowing students to be able to take online classes or video call into a classroom. This option is available to practically any school student who owns a computer or smart device. Students should be able to utilize distance learning since it will be beneficial to them if they are able to attend classes from home because they can access it from anywhere which is helpful to students who don't live in safe or convenient environments and children who suffer from bullying who can complete their schooling in their home environment if they prefer.

Not all parts of the world are fully developed or safe enough for students to be able to go to school every single day and learn in a healthy setting. There are rough neighborhoods in New York, New Jersey, and many other states in America where kids have to worry more about surviving the day rather than getting to school. This is the instance in many other places around the world like Iran, certain places in North Africa, and others. In environments like those, children are more concerned about their personal safety which means they would rather stay home than risk going outside into their dangerous worlds. A recent statistics report published by the US Bureau of Statistics shows that those types of countries that are dangerous due to their government or any other circumstance have had fewer literacy rates over the past couple years. This means that over the past couple years, the amount of people in those countries that are able to read and write have dropped. This key piece of data supports the claim that students are not able to go to school because of their environments which results in lower literacy rates. With distance learning as an option, those students can learn from the safety of their home. They can complete online classes or video conferencing so that they do not have to go out into their dangerous worlds. Some countries aren't fully advanced or developed enough so there is no school close by to most students. In rural parts of India, for example, there is sometimes only one school per village so kids who live on the outskirts of the village would have to travel at least three miles by foot since they are probably not fortunate enough to afford a mode of transportation. This puts students in difficult situations, especially when there may be sweltering hot weather or freezing winds. So if they are able to access their schooling online, then they wouldn't have to go through that struggle. Instead, they just have to open a computer at home and save all the trouble and hassle of traveling to far schooling. Distance learning benefits students who live in dangerous areas or in undeveloped countries.

Some children voluntarily don't want to go to school because they are bullied due to a variety of reasons which may be a mental illness, their looks, the way they speak, or even the way they dress. Most kids who are bullied face the bullying by skipping school for an extended period of time and falling behind in all their classes. Once they start falling behind in their classes, they may feel like never wanting to catch up again. A survey written by a social scientist was sent to students from 6th grade to 12th grade regarding how they react to bullying if they have ever gotten bullied. Many of those respondents said that they first skipped 3-7 days of school because they couldn't handle being in an area with so many people while someone was making them feel bad. Other students like them would probably also skip some school days if they are feeling this way which would increase the amount of work they miss at school. A solution to this problem would be if the students are able to attend their classes from their home which is possible by online classes or video conferencing. This is greatly helpful to the students who don't feel comfortable in their school environment but still want to be able to learn and make sure they are not falling behind.

Opponents of distance learning may try to argue that in a home environment, students don't feel as motivated to learn so they will have limited learning abilities if they are not at school. But, every student has a different learning style and by forcing them to learn in a large environment with many students, learning may not be as helpful. Some students prefer individual learning and they are able to grasp knowledge better that way. Distance learning allows those students who have a different type of learning style to go to school in a way that would better benefit them. Online classes and video conferencing is just more options available to students; these options will be greatly appreciated by kids who want a different type of approach to the way they are taught. The school environment can be stressful or even harmful to some people if they have extreme social anxiety or they feel unsafe. Distance learning is a beneficial option to students who are able to take advantage of this opportunity and maximizing on their own style of learning.

Being able to attend classes from home is an amazing technology advancement that should be beneficial to students who live in unsafe or inconvenient environments and children who suffer from bullying due to a variety of reasons who can complete their schooling at home if they prefer. Distance learning can provide an education for many of those who are need of it or even for those who want to be more comfortable while they are learning. Whatever the reason may be, distance learning is beneficial to many students and being able to attend classes from home is a positive aspect of schooling which should be taken advantage of.
