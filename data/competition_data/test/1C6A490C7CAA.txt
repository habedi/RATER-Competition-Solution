Dear Principal,

Some students do not think that community service is important, I think each student could do some community service, it wouldn't hurt. They could volunteer to do things at a sporting event or help someone with homework. Anything you do for someone makes a difference.

I would do community service. Show people that you care about what you are doing. If you think it's not fun than get a big group of friends together and clean up litter in your neighborhood. I think working at a food stand would be fun, seeing all your friends and joking around with them.

Each student should have required amounts of times to meet. Each student should have at least 200 hours of community service every year. Working with elderly people. Or tutoring little kids. People could work in selling food and beverages at sporting events. It may not sound all that thrilling, but it helps other people. It could be fun, just try it. Volunteering for things looks great on college applications, and job applications. It show that you are an outgoing person.

You could go to a park in your neighborhood and pick up trash that people littered. It's better to have a safe environment than a dirty one, and litter and trash that people threw on the ground makes everything look so gross, and not friendly. Helping someone out is not the worst thing in the world to do. It would make people happier with what you do for them, and how you show respect.

Everyone should do community service everyday. It's good to show people that you care. Community service does not take up to much of your time, it would be for an hour a day. It could be when you're not doing anything or when you're walking on the road and you see some litter on the street you could pick it up, it's not that hard.

I think it would be a good thing if you required everyone in the school to do at least some community service.
