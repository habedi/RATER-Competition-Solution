I believe that schools should offer distance learning for students, because it can allow them to learn easier, manage their tasks better, and they can have a better learning experience. By allowing students to take distance learning, you eliminate the need to travel to school to get your education; therefore, allowing students to learn at their home or at another location they need to be at. This method of learning can greatly benefit students, because some students may not feel comfortable going to school or prefer to stay at home; this form of learning also can make it so fewer people have to walk to school. The distance learning will allow those who have a difficult time going to school still get their education, but they can learn in a more comfortable environment and can focus easier. Whenever I feel sick or too exhausted to go to school, I generally miss out on my school work and fall behind. By enabling students to use distance learning, students won't have the same issue as I typically do and won't fall behind in classes. The students will still learn the material for that day, only they will just be at home rather than school.

Another way the distance learning could be beneficial is that it can allow students to manage their tasks easier. Traveling to and from school can not only be exhausting, but it can also take up a lot of time. Majority of students aren't able to drive, myself included, and so are forced to either walk or take the bus to and from school. The bus requires students to arrive at the stop at a certain time in order to get to school, sometimes the bus may take a while and cause students to be late. An example would be on the first day of school this year, my bus was late and picked up my stop at 9:15 and made me late to my classes, while it was only the first day and was just introductions

I did still miss class time and wasted other time I could have used efficiently. If there was the distance learning, I wouldn't need to worry about anything like that happening. I would be able to learn at home and wouldnt waste any time or risk being late to my classes. Another example would be if I wasn't able to take a bus to school or get driven, walking from my house to school would take about 40 minutes total. Walking would not only be exhausting, but also would take a very long time. The distance learning would allow me to make use out of that time and I could use that time to get work done rather than just walking.

The distance learning will also give students a better learning experience. A vast majority of students don't like school, and only go to see their friends. Some may just be anxious and others may not like the building itself. The distance learning would eliminate the feelings of anxiety and allow students to be much more comfortable when it comes to school. They won't have to worry about how they look, they won't need to worry about someone getting them sick or them getting anyone sick, and finally they can learn in a more comfortable environment. Students may have pets at home that make them happier, so the distance learning would allow them to still learn while letting the student stay with their pets and feel more relaxed.

Some may argue that the distance learning would not be a good idea. Perhaps because it could eliminate the need for bus drivers, schools themselves, or even faculty members. While those may be valid points, the distance learning doesn't eliminate them completely. The distance learning is only an option for students, and majority of students may choose to just go to school rather than learn online. The distance learning doesn't take away anything, it just allows those who aren't able to go to school to learn somewhere else. There will still be many students to attend school, only more of them may just learn online rather than in person.

The idea of distance learning would be most beneficial to students. The students would have a much better learning environment, can use their time better, and will be able to learn much easier. So please, urge your school to allow for distance learning so that students are able to get their education easier and more efficiently.Â
