Dear principle,

I believe that policy 2 would be more efficient because cell phones are distractions to kids at school. Kids hide cell phones from teachers when they are texting even if there is a rule that told kids that they could only use them at lunch time. Kid's cell phones are often stolen or lost at schools because they were not responsible enough to leave them at home.

Kids text all the time when there at school. Anytime the teacher is not looking, kids pull out there cell phones and start texting. Texting during school allows students not to learn as much as they should be. Bringing a phone to school can also distract the other students if it goes off in the middle of class.

Most of the time the teachers don't see the students pull out their phones in the middle of class. If teachers do catch them, they only penalize them for keeping it to the end of the day, but that wouldn't stop a student that texts all the time at school. If a teacher does catch a student texting they should suspend them for not paying attention to what they are learning.

Most kids leave their phones in their back pack when they go somewhere. At dances or any other activity that makes them leave their back pack in the open where someone can easily open their back pack and take it. If kids leave the phones at home they probably won't get their phones taken.

Cell phones are good and useful to have, but not at school. At school kids get distracted when texting. Most teachers don't see the student texting and the students could lose their phones. That's why you, the principle, should ban phones from school.

Your Student,
