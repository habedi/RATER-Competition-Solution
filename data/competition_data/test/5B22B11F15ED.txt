I think having a Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is very valuable. There are many positive outcomes to having it in the room with the children. It can help stusdent counselers for a school with this technology. It can help just about all the students in a school. I think this would be a very useful thing for a classroom.

How can it help in a classroom? Lets say a teacher noticed a student that was having a bad day or looked down in general. The teacher would then send them to a computer to use the Facial Action Coding System to help see how the student is feeling. The teacher can then send the student to a counseler to discuss how the student is feeling using the technology on the computer.

In paragraph 6, it said that the computer could recognize when a student is bored or confused with a lesson. If a student the best day, the computer would recognize it and the student can be helped out with his or her situation. Thats when the student would be sent to talk to someone about whats going on with them.

In couclusion, I strongly think that having a Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would be very useful. It can make a teacher and student counselers job 10 times easier. It may cost the school some money for the technology but it would be toatally worth it.
