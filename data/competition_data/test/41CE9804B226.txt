Teachers and students believe that it was a not really good idea to take and teach classes online because is more difficult to teach and teachers need to do more work ,for the students and that some students don't doing anything if we take classes online and not all the students have computer or internet thas why i'm thinking that is not a really good idea the classes online it was difficult for everyone when think in the positive and negative things and we can see that is not a easy idea and have more negative thing is a more difficult way than go to the school and take classes in school like always because online is more difficult and more expensive because we need to buy computer if the school don't have and we need to put internet if we don't have too so in my opinion classes online is a more difficult way.

First, one reason is that l think that is more difficult for the teachers if they need to teach the classes online because they need to do more work than they did in the school. For example, if the students have classes online the teachers have the responsabilitie to every day teach the classes for many students and put differences themes and homeworks for seventh differences classes and they really not if the students stay really understand every theme because is more difficult to not if the all students understand thas why l think is more difficult take and teach classes online and sometimes the teachers can do to much in her houses because they have thinks to do some teachers have daugters or sons to take care and is more difficult to do everthing in home.

Additionally, some students don't have computer and it was a problem if the classes are online and sometimes some school bring computers for the students but it does matter because is a really big responsibility to have a computer that is not yours. For example, most the students don't have internet in her houses to take classes online thas why when we have only the option to take classes only some students prefer no continue studie anymore in the school because it was difficult and no all the paents have the money for buy a computer or put internet in her house and more difficulty when parents have more than one child that need to studied online and what happen with the little childs that don't have idea to use a computer and his parents don't have the time to help his son. is many devanges that we have if we take classes online.

However, no everyone agrees with this position some people claim that take classes online is more easy and better than take in school because we are in home we not have the neccesary to wake up early every single morning and we more comfort if we stay all day in home we no need to expensive money in food because we be stay all the day in home. but thas the only good way that we have to take classes in home, so for me l think some students don't do anything if take classes online because don't have the responsibility to do his works and homeworks or is possible too that the many students decide no continue studie because have classes online and if more easy for they stop continue with classes online his parents sometimes don't have the time for always help when we don't understand something and we never see the teachers and we have seventh differences teachers so thas difficult for take classes online.

ln conclucion, we can see that are many reasons that is difficulty to take classes online the online good way that we have is that we can be stay in home,but in my conclution is more difficult to take classes online because is difficult for the teacher becauses they need to put and do everthing online, and for the students because is difficult too and expensive for students and parents and some parents don't have the time to see if his son stay doing everthing that the teacher put because they don't have contact with the teacher and some person can' use computers too thas a way that we need to think that some students, teachers, and parents can use this thinks like computer or phones so is more easy to go and take classes normal in schoool this is my conclucion and maybe many students can be agree or desagree with my opinion but thas what i think.
