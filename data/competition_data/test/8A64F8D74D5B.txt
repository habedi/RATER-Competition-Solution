Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Since the school's cell phone policy is being reconsidered, i believe students shouldn't be allowed to have phones out while at school.

Many teenagers would disagree with my opinion, but I have many good reasons.

Students wouldn't get as much exercise.

After lunch they would be more focused on texting than interacting with there student body that is face to face with them.

Since we have the privilege of getting to go outside after lunch and talk or play football, basketball etc. many students would be more worried about their phones than getting rid of all there energy that has built up all morning while sitting in a classroom.

I think a lot of students would also take advantage of the privilege by using them during class while a teacher wasn't looking.

Many students do it anyway and phones have to be turned off.

Also i think this would lead to a lot more drama and children getting into trouble.

Someone could text their friend and say something mean about another person but that person would find out they had been talked about at school so the problem would have to be handled at school and not at home.

There would be more verbal abuse that could lead to physical fighting.

From my point of view students would be more interested in checking their phones than going to class or remembering to go by their locker and grab their homework for their next class.

This would lower many grades and may cause students to fail a class or even a grade.

Many students might make it a habit to be tardy or skip class because of this new policy as well.

The school's cell phone policy should not be changed because along with this change their would be many problems that would also occur.

Students can use their cell phones on their own time out of school.

Please consider my reasoning before the policy is finally changed.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
