I think technology to read students emotional expression in a classroom is valuable. The reason why i think technology to read students emotional expressions is valuable because students should always be happy and never upset or confused. In the article it said "By weighting the different units, he software can even indentify mixed emotions." (Nick D'Alto 4) If the teacher sees that the student is not happy then maybe they can help them. Students have been hurting them selves and with technology like this could save many students lives.

Teachers could help a student in a classroom if they are upset and talk to them about it. I think this technology is very valuable and it can inspire students to create technology like this in the future. This type of technology could also let students know how much technology can really do. This technology can help help teachers understand if their students are confused or not. In the article it said "A cassroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." (Nick D'Alto 6)

This could improve students grades because if a student is confused it can let the teacher know so that they know to reteach it so that the student understands.

Technology like this can imrove many things like how a student feel and even the teachers. More technology should be introduced to students in class rooms to help them improve to make the world better like this technology. This may even inspire them to create technology and making it their job. It said in the article that if a student got confused it could help. In the article it said "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." (Nick D' Alto 6)

Technology that enables computers to identify human emotions is cool and i think they should install this technology in every students computer. This technology not only helps student but teachers too.

This could help improve many things i dont see why they wouldn't. This could help students know how they are feeling every day. In the article it said " In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day." (Nick D'Alto 5)
