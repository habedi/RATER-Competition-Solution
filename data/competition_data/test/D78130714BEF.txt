Cell phones have some way of taking our full individual attention for however long we allow it to. We become easily distracted and connected to our phones. People usually look at it just to look at it, without any notifications popping up, solely based on us humans being attracted to our phone. There also is that part of us using our cell phones to stay in the mix, see what's hot on Instagram, or if that hot guy or girl posted on Snapchat. There are many times and places you could multitask with your phone. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with because slip-ups while driving are very unforgiving. One minor mistake on the road can cause your life or someone else's life to be taken. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

Fatality is an occurrence of death by accident. Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving ("Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year ("On the Road).

Nearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving ("Texting and Driving Accident Statistics"). In 2016, 3,450 fatalities were caused by texting and driving ("Texting and Driving Accident Statistics"). Also one out every four car crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving ("Texting and Driving Statistics). In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of others.

Texting and driving is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is the most common and dangerous thing you could do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk ("On the Road"). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is.

Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol ("Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving"). Steering control while distracted is 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration ("Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving").

In 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distracted driving resulted in approximately 2,600 deaths in 2002 ("Texting while driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous). The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities (Masters, "Texting While Driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous?). Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving drunk.

Texting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers ("Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?"). Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason ("Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?"). In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense ("Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?"). There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 ("Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?"). Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise. According to a group of researchers, they found that some kind of texting law leads to a 2.3% decrease in fatalities for all drivers. Specifically banning teen drivers from texting reduced traffic deaths in that group by 11 percent ("Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?"). In conclusion, texting and driving could ultimately cause you unnecessary fees, or big time in prison.

In summary, drivers should know that they are dealing with something serious when driving a car. There are limited chances in life;texting and driving are pushing those chances away. Drive with the intent and purpose to get to your destination. Deal with texts after or before you drive, because it could cost you everything. Attention is highly needed when driving, there are split-second decisions to be made while driving and your phone distracts your attention enough to potentially cause accidents. Your reaction time is based on how early you see it, looking at a phone prohibits you from reacting. In conclusion, put your phone away while driving to save lives!
