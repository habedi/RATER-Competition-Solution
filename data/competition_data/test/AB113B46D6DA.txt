As a citizen of the United States, I have the right to have my poinion on the Electoral College, and my opinion is that we should not have an Electoral College because of many reasons. The reasons include the following; if American citizens vote for a slate of electors that then vote for the president, we technically aren't even voting ourselves. Also, the electors that we vote for to elect our persident don't always have to vote for the persident we want, but it could also be in a case as if who they wanted to vote for. Lastly, the population of states affects the amount of votes casted off into the possible president's election.

In the Electoral College process, we, the U.S. citizens, vote for a group of electors who then vote for the President of the United States. According to

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Best-Laid Defenses of the System are Wrong ,

the qoute:

"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president (Paragraph 10)." Based on what the information that the paragraph is giving us, the citizens of the U.S. technically are not even having a say in who the president is, America uses the qoute "It's a free country", but really, you're not even letting the people have a say in who the next president is. . .

Based on what I stated in the second paragraph, whoever we vote to be our electors of the voting for the U.S. president, don't always have to vote for who the citizens want as president, but what they, the members of the congress want. "Who are the electors? They can be anyanyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential canidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. (Paragraph 10)." It doesn't matter who is votting, what does matter is that they all have diffwereet oppinions on who would do better if president. These electors chosen to vote are basically allowed to vote on whoever they agree is right, your vote is invalid to their poinion, it' who they want. And is that fair? No.

Another reason I do not think the electoral college is right is because the population of states affects the amount of votes casted off into the possible president's election. For example, according to paragraph 12 of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Best-Laid Defenses of the System are Wrong , it says "Because each state casts only one vote, the single represenative from Whyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as 55 represenatives from California, who represent 35 million voters." What this is trying to say, is that it doesn't even matter about how many voters there are, but about how man represenatives there are. This leads me back to my point of where we really have no say in who is president or not.

In the electoral college, In the Electoral College process, we, the U.S. citizens, vote for a group of electors who then vote for the President of the United States, but that doesn't always mean we get what we want when it comes to voting. Many reasons are listed about why the electoral college is not a helpful or meaningful process.
