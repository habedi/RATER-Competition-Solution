Dear TEACHER_NAME

The topic of community service has come up lately for students. Weather that students should be required to do community service or not. My opinion for this matter is that community service should be required but not that much of it.

One reason I think that we should have students help our community is that our world is falling apart when it comes to pollution and such. Everyday we see trash, cigarettes, and dirty roads. As a student i think that we especially need to reach out to other students because if we don't change it then who will? A pastor once said "If not now then when, if not you then who?"

Another reason is that we have people that are not fortunate enough to had the thing like we have. Like food, clothes, shelter, I think that our school should reach out to those in need by providing food to the homeless or giving the homeless warm clothes for the winter. There are many ways we can reach out to those in need.

With these reasons there are problems unfortunately. Students have activity's and hobbies after school so this service has to be taken during school. We could perform this generous work during recess at school. It will not kill students to miss one or two days of recess. This way you can make sure that all of the students have had there certain amount of community service.

This is a big subject to displace if you do not decide to get your school involved into this service. I'm sure you wouldn't want your child growing up in a dirty world or sitting their and watching people die from starvation. I hope you take this letter into consideration.

Sincerely,
