Mars the red planet is our next destination for the human race and we want to find out as much as we can about it before fully exploring it. Something interesting has occured and many people think that it's the work of aliens. Why would aliens want to buid a giant face? Is it really the work of aliens or just a natual landform? I'll tell you why it's just a natural landform and not an ancient Egyptian-like pyramid.

With the recent photographs of the so called "face" it has become clear to me that it is just a natural landform as seen in the picture taken in 2001. The phoograph shows that the mesa is made from the same dirt as the dirt around it. If aliens wanted to buid shelter, wouldn't they want to buid something more sturdy? Also wouldn't there be a quarry of some sort to get the resorces to build that thing? It is just a natual landform just like the ones you would see on Earth.

As said in the article, the time of year that the photo was taken was during a cloudy time of year so that could have made the photo blurry and harder to see thus making the mesa look like a face. Garvin even says that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Mars is a cold desert planet with very little atmosphere or resources. There have been signs of water on Mars but that is long since gone. If there was life on Mars it's long gone but it is very unlikely for life to have ever existed there.

Space harbors mysteries and we as humans have a desire to uncover them. When something wierd happens (the face) we get to work in uncovering what it really is. There really is only one way to find out what it is for certain; we have to go there and see for ourselves which will bring up more and more questions about space.
