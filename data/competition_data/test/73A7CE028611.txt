Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that your first policy, the one which students are allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, is the best policy of your two choices.

I believe my in my opinion because it allows students to have a sense of freedom in the school. As long as students know that, they must turn off their phones during classes, I believe there wouldn't be a problem. This is a great idea because with this, less rules are set to be broken, because students know that their conversation will be open for comments once they reach lunch or a free period. This will make students a little more patient and focused during class. Along with this it allows the students to be more social without all of the yelling and screaming throughout the hallways during their free periods and lunch time. Due to the fact, they can simply send a text message or call a friend.

Some reasons why I believe that this idea wouldn't succeed is due to the fact that some kids may not be able or ready to handle the responsibility of having a phone, and may forget to turn it off, and then have a phone ring in class. Then this will give reason to the teacher to take their phone as punishment. However, this is only an assumption.

Now my reasons for the second policy, and why it wouldn't work. I have doubts in this policy because students may need their phones for after school activities and other emergency reasons. This could often lead to kids having a hard time communicating with parents or friends when a ride is needed. I also believe that to enforce this policy you may have to go through drastic measures to enforce such a strict rule. Such as investing in a metal detector to prevent phone entry into the school, which would costs money, limiting the funds for educational purposes.

These are all of my reasons in why the first policy for students of our school is the best way to go in my opinion.

Sincerely,

Anonymous student
