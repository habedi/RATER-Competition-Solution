Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a great way for kids to express their selves in so many ways. But for some kids, community service isn't what its all thought out to be.

Some kids don't have the opportunity to do anything outside of school. I know i have a ton of homework and to top that off, i have three different sports i have to do consecutively after school. I like your thought about assigning ever student with community service, but i wouldn't expect getting a positive response back. Only the matter being, kids love to play and do what they want to do. So unless they choose to help outside of school with the community, i doubt they would want to help.

On the other hand, there are kids who would love to show their affection for their community by doing whatever is possible. Maybe putting a sign outside of school for people to sign up to help out the community would be a good idea. Not only that, but there are people who need discipline. Or some people who don't show up to school very often as needed, should get service hours to make up the hours they haven't attended school. That would be a great way to get more kids to do community work! As for tutoring kids, im sure that's also considered as "community service", and i know a few people that are wonderful at almost every curricular subject. We could pay those students to tutor others, i know kids love money these days, im sure they'd take the opportunity if they got the chance.

On your thought about assigning EVERY student community service is a little absurd. I'm one of those students who wouldn't want to do what i wouldn't want to do after school or none the less, on my own time. Only because, i have important things to do on my own time. Like doing homework, sports, and getting caught up with my friends. Community service, i think, is a wonderful thing to do, for people who actually have the time and effort to do it.
