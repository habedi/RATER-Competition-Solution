The machine reads your face and uses muscles to sense what you are feeling. I am against the Facial Action System And I will tell you why.

In the article it says,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Kids might not be comfortale in a classrrom that has a machine that can identify their emotuons. That is very nerve-racking and would make it hard to focus and learn. Is students can't focus then this machine will not be helping.

The article also says,"In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day." If we perform this everyday, why do we need another machine to do it? It is a reason that it is an emotion and Not actual words. Kids might not want anyone to know how they are feeling. This machine invades peoples privacy and should not be allowed.

In Conclusion, this machine has a lot of abilities that may be too advanced for us. Kids want their privacy this "Facial Action Coding System" Will effect it. This Machine will make then nervous instead of focused like they should be.
