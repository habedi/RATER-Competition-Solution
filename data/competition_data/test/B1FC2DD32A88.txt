Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis; drivers should be able to use cell phones in a restricted capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a mobile phone while driving can be distracting to most people, especially the younger generations. This makes is very dangerous and there have been horrible accidents and even deaths to happen while texting and driving in particular. While this may be a true fact, there are different ways you can control the use of cell phones while driving.

Some states have made it illegal to use a cell phone while driving and others passed laws that enable your use of cell phones restricted like Georgia and the hands free law. Some may argue that the hands free law is not safer than holding a phone while driving. I think that there are more things that can be put in place to assist with the use of cell phones and driving.

My argument is that I believe we should be able to use cell phones in a more restricted way which will eventually save lives. We currently live in a world where technology rules us as humans. I say why not allow it to rule us in a safe way. We have self-driving cars; hands free voice to type mechanisms on our devices and even most vehicles that are being made now can read your text for you as you drive. In my opinion, if we use more of these mechanisms properly it would save more lives. Self driving cars will allow us not to be worried about driving on the road; if you insist on texting and driving, why not use the voice to text feature on your phone and finally purchasing a vehicle that will read and type the text to you.

While my theories seem far fetched, I believe one day we will be able to live in a world where we will be able to operate cell phones and drive on a daily basis without getting hurt. Technology has brought us this far we should be able to go further if we invent ways to use it in a safe and responsible manner.
