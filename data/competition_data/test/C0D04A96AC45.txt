Many students can argue the fact that we would want to have our summer available and free. Not loaded with all of these projects that future teachers will assign to us. But have you ever thought about the reason why teachers do this? It's to give insight and a general observation about how the class that you signed up for will be like. Teachers don't give these projects to ruin our summer. In fact, a lot of them would much rather have us enjoy our summer. However, students need intellect about the class that they should eventually be prepared for. 3 months is a lot of time to forget about the material that you previously learned. Which is why I believe that having summer projects that are teacher-designed would be more beneficial to the graduating students. Teacher-designed projects will prevent students from not learning properly, memory loss and provide teachers an insight about what to teach.

To start off, every student would much agree to ban and/or make summer projects optional. Including myself. But we, as students, never realized the benefits and refreshments that these projects provide for us. If students were to somehow "design" these projects, students would obviously take the easy route instead of pushing themselves to become smarter and more vigilant of the criteria that will be taught. For example, various schools and counties require students to read some sort of book and log it over the summer. From experience, we would per say, completely forget about the assignment and log fake dates and pages just for the sake of "doing it". Through this path, the student did not learn and influence their reading abilities due to this method. Therefore, validating my thought process. On the other hand, when teachers give a specific book to read, students will most likely read the book or at least read upon a summary to have a little knowledge, knowing that the teacher would give out some kind of quiz or paper to complete. The purpose of requiring a specific book is to provide a reference about how the class will be like and the criteria that will be taught. Student-designed projects would not be reliable in this case.

As a student, memory loss is very frequent in my case. I forget about a handful of material and subjects that have been taught. When given a vocabulary test, I tend to blank and forget about the words that I have studied because it wasn't taught to me over and over again. Memory loss can happen to anyone because it's unpreventable. This is another reason as to why summer projects are designed and assigned. It's to refresh our memory and remind us about the education that has been previously learned. If projects were to be student-designed, they would most likely have absolutely nothing to do with the future subjects. We have no knowledge about what a teacher is going to teach. In this case, wrong statements will be acquired and lead to misconceptions. Our memory would be refreshed with these non-true subjects creating a confused situation once the school year begins.

Not only do teacher-designed projects give students support, but it also gives the teachers support. Teachers can prepare themselves for the upcoming year through summer projects. It can give them some expectation of what to teach. Eventually creating some circumstances that can be built off of. It gives the ability to expand the criteria into something more knowledgeable. For instance, a biology teacher can assign a project that can revolve around cells like eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This project could later on be broken down into units because the project was based on a very broad topic. Because students completed the teacher-designed project, they could possibly be more ready to accomplish learning requirements faster. The knowledge of these students would be broadened leading to an easier understandingÂ of the beginning units.

Unfortunately, teacher-designed summer projects could create stress and anxiety. Summer is a time for children to enjoy no homework, tests and etc. Projects should not be given on a time where students can receive a break. Subsequently, required projects are not going to disappear. Student-designed projects could have less of an influence towards stress because it would most likely be easy to complete and have the possibility of incorporating fun activities. This would achieve the factor of less stress and anxiety of completing a project on time. Although these circumstances appeal greatly to students, teacher-designed projects would believably contain a more beneficial outcome. In the end, a project that has correct information will more likely have a positive outcome in the long run. In conclusion, educators creating these projects will bring upon a better learning experience for students. Teacher-designed projects will prevent students from not learning properly, memory loss and provide teachers an insight about what to teach.
