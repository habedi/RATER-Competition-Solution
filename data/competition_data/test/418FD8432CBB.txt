Everyday there are people dying or in an accidents because they are using cellphones while driving.

Some causes of accidents/crashes while driving on the phone is voice calling, playing videos games, looking in the camera, trying to answer a phone call, or trying to check a message. It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cellphones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

Cell phones while driving is one of the biggest issues in today's society. People are using their cellphones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, or being on social media. Sometimes we can do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are using their cellphones while they are driving. We have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others and ourselves because we cannot put the phone down.

Using cellphone while driving is not a good idea because it can hurt others/yourself, the roads, rise your insurance, or even have to come out your pocket to pay for the damage you have created to someone else car.

Texting while driving and otter cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threating norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phones use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while distracted, including the use of mobile device while driving, resulting in injury and loss of life .

Therefore, if you have an emergency you may use a cell phone to dial 911 o you can also pull over. When you have an emergency you have the right to dial the police if something is not right.

In my opinion people use that right to get on social media, check messages, or call someone instead of just continue to drive and keep their eyes on the road.

In my opinion you should not use cell phones while driving because it can cause crashes, death, or even hurt the road.

If it's not an emergency you should not be able to use your mobile device.
