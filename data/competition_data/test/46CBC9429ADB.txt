Dear TEACHER_NAME's:

I wonder why we don't get to use phones in schools i got to reasons why we should use them my two reasons are?

my first reason is that just like working adults students need a break from sitting in a boring class all day working and studying and taking quiz's to alot of students in the united states cell phones is are way of communicating with people and each other we should be able to talk on are cell phones at lunch to kind of take away the stress we have in the classrooms.

my second reason i think we should have cell phones is because it keeps occupied so you don't fall into any trouble it is the backbone to a teens society it also helps teens with there communicating skills and helps us talk better. and that's why i think we should have phones during are free time lunch periods,breaks,library. etc.

well i told you my two reasons why i think students should be allowed to have phones at school and on school facilities.
