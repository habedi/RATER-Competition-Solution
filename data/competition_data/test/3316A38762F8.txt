The facial action coding system in a classrom is valuable. It is valuable because when a student is confused and doesn't understand what the teacher is teaching, the teacher or the computer will know immeadeality and they or it will help the student understand to further their education process. If a student is bored the teacher or the computer will regonize it and do something to make their learning expirence more remeberable, so when it is ime to take a test they wil remember it and they wouldn't fail.

For example, In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang states that "A classroom computer could regonize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored,( Dr. Huang predicts) then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." .

This example explains that the computers could help kids when they are confused or bored. This shows that facial action coding systems can be used in school to help kids with the learning and further their education for the future as well the present.
