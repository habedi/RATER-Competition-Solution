Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Teachers are brilliant, and have many degrees in what they study; therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for work, and teachers know their students capabilities; however, others could say that summer projects should not be teacher-designed.

First, summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for their work. As a student, it is hard for a teacher to go home and tell someone to do a summer project. I would need all the following information: details, when it's due, specifics, how long it has to be, etc. Doing a project over the summer isn't always the most fun thing to do, but it is for the purpose of a student keeping their knowledge over the summer. Not a lot of teachers want their students to have summer work, but teachers also don't want their students coming back to school the next year not having any knowledge because they didn't do their summer project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for their work.

Second, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what their students can and can't do. Every class has their stronger students and their weaker students. Teachers can design to the point of where it's manageable for every person in their class to do it. If a summer project were to be teacher-designed, then they would have the power to do everything. A teachers job is to do these types of things, so there is no reason for a teacher to put pressure on the student to make a summer project. Teachers know what their students are capable of, so the students shouldn't have a hard time doing a project in their capabilities. There are so many options that teachers have, and students have the most bright and brilliant brains in the world. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what their students can and can't do.

On the other hand, others could say that summer projects should not be teacher-designed. Making a summer project student-designed would let the student be free, and give the student the opportunity to do whatever he/she wants. Letting a student design a project on his/her own, can lead to many things. Students could take things to far in the project, they could end up making up something that isn't school appropriate. There are too many things that go on in a students mind. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

In conclusion, being a student is not of the greatest thing in the world. Not a lot of students enjoy school, and half the time the teachers don't as well. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for their work, and teacher know what their students can and can't do; however, others could say that summer projects should not be teacher-designed. Teachers have control in what they do for their students. Teachers make these projects so their students don't lose their knowledge over the summer. Teachers are brilliant, and have many degrees in what they study; therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.
