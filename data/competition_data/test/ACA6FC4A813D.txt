To the editor:

I think that we should have phones only during lunch passing time and in some classes were you don't do anything like having free time. The only problem would be that some people don't follow the rules and don't put them away when they need to. Id say that they should allow phones just in case of emergencies like power goes out and kids need to call parents and there is to many that don't have there phones cause there are no phones allowed that's why i think we should be able to have phones in school.

If there we were to have a power outage and teachers forgot there phones then how would we call parents that's why we should have our phones. Some parents don't even buy their kids phones so that's why teachers have there phones but the kids that do have phones should be able to bring there phone to school. I just think there should be at least one cell phone in school just in case of a power outage or something like that.

The policy 1 is a good idea just some students don't follow that rule at all. Some teachers hate students having there cell phones in school. If you ride a bus to school and a tire pops who is going to have a phone to call the school or parents if there is no phones allowed at school. If someone got hurt on the bus or at a game or something like that happened at school you need a phone to call a ambulance or the police.
