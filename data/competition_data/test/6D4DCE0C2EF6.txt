Summer assignments should be designed by the student with the whole student body in mind. The point of school is to prepare and benefit an individual for the remainder of their life in society. With this in mind, school work should be universally understood by the student so that everyone is in mind and everyone has an equal opportunity. What better way for an assignment to be understood if its created by the student? Students know themselves and their peers more than teachers do, so it would be best if students made a project that would suit them best.

A summer assignment is more of a pain than the usual assignment because it takes away precious time from the summer, so in order to make the project less of a chore, it would lift the spirit of the student if it was them in charge of what the work load could be. The student wouldn't see it as much of a woeful task, but rather a commitment they themselves made. If its more personalized, then students would take more time and dedication to work on the assignment. It would feel more like a prompt that would be in their best interest to better themselves and not a school issued worksheet.

Also, a student designed project would benefit the teachers, too. They wouldn't have to take the time out of their busy schedule to produce a lengthy assignment, and having a teacher designed one would make it more standardized and less suitable to the audience it is targeting. It would be mundane and frankly, acrimonious for a teacher to grade an assignment they created, especially depending on how many students are doing the project. It would be a relief for the teacher and would prove that their students are responsible and ambitious enough to create and work on a school assignment that proves their own worth as a student.

In my personal experience with summer assignments, the school has always issued work designed by the county. This has proved to be not that efficient of a task, because most of my classmates failed to complete, or even attempt to do the summer project because it was so daunting, and the fact that it was to be done over the summer made it worse. I'll even admit I didnt finish any of my summer assignments either for that same reason. The teachers speak of summer assignments with much vicar, thus showing that both teacher and student loath the project. Now there would be a different outcome if it was student designed. The student would have completed it since it was a project that they committed to, and the teacher would see it as a task that builds the character of a student.

A student designed project is in many ways a better alternative to teacher designed ones. Its an assignment benefits everyone involved. Students would likely finish to project in a shorter time since it would hold their attention. It is a task that gets a student prepared for the following year, and what better way to have a teacher introduced to a student by grading a piece of work created by the student themselves. A student designed summer assignment is the only way to go.
