I disagree because it would be hard for me to pick one extracurricular activity and not because their is so many but because their is not enough. Also because its hard for me to open up to new things besides sports and honestly i wouldnt know what to do. And even if i was gonna do a sport I wouldnt like it because of how overprotective it would be.

reasons i wouldnt join would be because of how much time you will have to spend doing something you werent sure about doing in the first place but still having to do it because thats what you signed up for. And once i realize that i dont like it and stop doing work teachers and students are gonna gang up on me and mentally jump me with their "if you didnt like this class why did you pick it.

I also dont want to pick a subject that I wouldnt like and have to do it and if that extracurricular class did have a grade then get a bad grade on it. And then once my teacher and my parents meet its gonna be this whole discussion about how my grades fell. so if you where in the situation of agreeing or not what would you have done what would you have done if you where in that situation.
