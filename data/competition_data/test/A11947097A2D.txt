Although some say that the students should complete summer projects because some of them want to learn more and to prepare for a good future, actually the students should not complete summer projects because some of them want to have vacations, relax their mind and out to visit their families.

The first reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to have vacation and they want to have a break in the summer. They get tired because they go to school everyday/every week in the morning and their body need to relax, need a break because some of them work in the night and they arrive to their home very night like around 12:00am and they sleep a little bit. So that's why some of them get tired to school, some of them does not want to do anything in the school because they are tired and they don't have enough energy in their body. However, they need to have vacations in the summer, sleep more and get more energy.

Also, some student could get in a big deppression by worrying about everything in school, more if they are working in the afternoon, they could die. So, they need to relax their mind and forget about everything in school.

The third reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to out with their families, friends or to visit their families that are far away. Some of them wants to travel to another country or place and that is the only opportunity that they can go in the summer, some of their families are far away and they want to visit them because maybe they don't see them a long time ago, and they need to travel to another place to relax and have vacations. Visit their friends or out with them because the majority of students want to out with their families or friend like a group and have fun with them.

The conclusion is that every body/ every student need to have vacation in the summer and not go to school because they need to relax their mind and get more energy for their body, they need to have a break and out with other people to another place or country and have a lot of fun.Â
