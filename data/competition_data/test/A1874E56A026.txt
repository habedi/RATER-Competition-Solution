If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens I would tell them it was not created by aliens. That's how it was formed just because it's formed that way doesn't mean it was created by aliens. I believe it was just formed like that and there's nothing wrong with it being formed like it's formed because in the article it says, a "huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth".

First of all, In May 24,2001 in the artcile it says," It was twenty five years ago something happened around Mars. Viking 1 which is NASA's spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face". Secondly, It also says in the article," Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the images appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. Thirdly, There was no alien monument after all." But not everyone was satisfied they needed more evidence to believe that there were no aliens that created the Face on Mars. Lastly, the Mission controllers prepared to look again and make sure that aliens didn't create the Face on Mars It was hard work but they did the mission anyways.

If I was a scientist that's what I would discuss about the Face on Mars because I feel like that it wasn't created by aliens it was just a natural landform like the article stated. I believe it was formed like that because of God he forms things not aliens. That concludes what I would discuss if I was a scientist discussing about the Face on Mars and who thinks it was created by aliens.
