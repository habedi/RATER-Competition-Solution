I think that you guys should all become a Seagoiing Cowboy with me so than we can adventure the world and ride the waves together.

This will make it a lot easier to do the job as a Seagoing Cowboy. We will be able to ride the waves together. And have more time to play around and have fun because the job will get done faster then if I am by myself.

Also I think you should join the program because we can experience the world together and learn new things about being a Seagoing Cowby and new ways to make the job go by faster and so we can have more fun. Then after we find out more ways to do the jobwe can explore the ocean on our way to our destination. There is kinda some flaws because it will almost always smell pretty bad and some days it will take a long time to get the job done. But on the other hand it will be full of fun adventures a long the way with a lot of fun times coming right our way.

These are all the reasons why I think all of you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It is also for boys and girls so anyone can come and work with me because the more the better and faster the job will be done.
