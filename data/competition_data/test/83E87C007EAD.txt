Why do we vote? we vote because it lets us have a say so in who is above us. The electoral college doesnt let us do that. We vote but it does no use. By you having the Electoral College, means our votes are worthless because youre going to do what you want anyways. Electors choose who they want to run the country not us. You need to change the electoral college too popular votes for next election for 1. because its fair and its a say so from everyone not just a group of people. 2. you know theirs no cheating. and 3. Everyones vote counts.

Changing the elctoral college to popular votes is a good idea because its a fair game. Everyone gets their vote in, everyones word counts, theirs no cheating. Any canidate running can cheat and "pay" the electors without anyone knowing. They may think they know whats best but do they really? Letting it be a popular vote wont only make it a fair game but will include everyones vote as important as anyone elses.

Voting is an important part of this country. Thats why you have to wait till youre 18. otherwise they'd let you vote at any age. voteing lets you have a say so. but if you vote and it doesnt go towards anything and the electors choose anyways then why do we vote period? Having popular votes means everyones vote counts. big time.

Thats why you need to change the Electoral College to Popular voteing. Please take this into consideration. We need to have a voice of our own not others.
