Dear principal

I think everyone in our school should not have community service.

The reason this is my response is because there is a lot of student who barley do good in school and now they will start to do worst.

the reason is because they will not have enough time to study and to finish there homework. this is just putting one more task to there school job.

Now it's not just test and homework now they must do double the work by helping other students with there school.

If kids decide that it will be nice to help out they should at least an 85 average or above. even then I think they should volunteer.

I do think that community service should not be forced upon our students because then that will take time from there school work and as well as there fun time.

This is what i think about thus.
