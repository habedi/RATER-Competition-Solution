The new technology to read emotional expressions I believe is very helpful. Not only helpful in the classroom but also in everyones' everyday life. This new technology helps determain how a person is feeling . They discovered many methods . They use our face muscles to see how we are feeling. There is six classified emotions. There is happiness, surprise, anger, disgues, fear and sadness. They'll use their very advanced technology to determain how someone in a picture is feeling or in person.

The techology is very advanced they are now using it towards ads. They'll see if they should continue putting that ad is it makes you happy or as they "bring a smile to your face". If it does not they'll change it and use something else to make you happy. There whole ideal idea is to make people like the thing they are putting out or showing. If the person is showing happiness that will help determain if they like it . I'll show that the person likes the idea and will like to see more of it.

Wouldnt you like to see hows a person 100% feeling. With all this new technology we'll always know how someone is . Everyone thought that the Mona Lisa just smiling. No one would've that she was 83% happy , 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. Now we can see how everyone is feeling. Now we can calculate peoples feelings thats just another step to the future. Our technology is getting more advanced and is getting better.

I know alot of people would love this new way to determain peoples feelings. Not just by the way they look now just now a little more detailed. Now we know people arent 100% everything . Students will really find this method really helpful for there work. They can get alot of information then just one thing they can just assume but now they can be very determained in it . This technology is very valuable .
