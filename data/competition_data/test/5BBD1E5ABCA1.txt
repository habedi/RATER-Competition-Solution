Dear Principal,

I hear that you are doing some new policies at school, and I was thinking you should do policy 1, to let students bring phones to school and use them during other free times. Phones are very helpful at school, and deserve to have them at school. When you are in math class you can use it for a calculator, when you are staying after school you can call someone and let them know, and if you are lost.

First you should let students have phones at school because they are useful. When you are in math class and you don't know a multiplication problem you can use the calculator on your phone which is must faster. Also if there isn't enough calculators at school you can just use your phone. It will make everything faster and easier.

Another thing, you can use your phone after school, so if you are staying for an activity you can let your parents know. Because what if you don't have a phone with you and your parents will never know where you are at. Also if you use the schools phone, your parents might not recognize that number and might not answer.

Lastly, phones are useful when you are lost. If you have your phone with you, you can just call your friends and see if they can help you. And if it's the first day at the school you don't have to be looking for people and just text them to see where there at instead of being a loner.

Phones can be helpful for many things that's why you should consider policy 1. Phones have a calculator to help you in math class, when you are staying after school to let someone know, and if you are lost and looking for someone.
