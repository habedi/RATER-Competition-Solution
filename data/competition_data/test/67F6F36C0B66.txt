Are summer projects better design by students or teachers. Summer projects should be design by teachers because they know the content they will give us, the right exercises to work on and will help us with next year school material.

The content of every subject is important to understand, it also depends on which material they are working on. Lets say; for example, in English class the section design by the teacher will be easier to understand because the teacher will put all the information, the students need to remember for next school year or later on in their future. A teacher will always want to make sure of the students learning, besides all the material they need to know will be better organized and clearer. Scientifically they say the more you read, the human brain gains more knowledge and it will help the students grow on their vocabularies. The information is believable if the teacher gives students notes for their test if its searched online it would probably other type of writing.

When it comes to homework a teacher will look for better exercises for her students to work on and for them to accomplish them. In math the more exercises the teacher will give, the better chance the students have at learning and figuring out the problems, students that work on their summer projects and listen to what the teachers say have batter chance on have a better chance to have better grades in next school year. There is famous quote saying "practice makes perfect". For example one good example would be Helen Keller she was deaf and mute but later on her life she learned an practiced every day to read and write. she became a phenomenal person and writer.

Since technology has grown over the past few years teachers can now recommend students to watch videos like Khan academy for math to learn how to solve problems for next year, although for some classes they give light projects for students to do in groups, instructions are very needed and that is why its better for teachers to design summer projects. In Generic_School students an also try to practice in school or out of school. Direction are very important for teacher in school year when taking test, students dont see the directions and tend to ask teachers. The teachers will then give them examples to work on home and also how to read test questions.

However, some students may not agree with this position because either school projects take all their time and later on they would be bragging about how they didnt have a fun summer or some simply cant understand what the teacher is trying to express in a word problem or cant figure out what the question is saying. some kids in this world have different ways of learning and a teacher should figure that out some learn visually others by just hearing etc. other students are just to tired.

This is why Summer projects should be design by teachers because they will give the necessary information for a student to learn and to practice from it from home. Also these students should have summer projects to refresh their memories.

Summer projects are good for students an they should work on them and not be lazy, if they do their project the can have a better summer and finish with their task and be relived also summer projects are far better design by their teachers because kids have more advantage to learn from and to keep practicing
