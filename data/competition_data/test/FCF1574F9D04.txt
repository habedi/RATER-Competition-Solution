Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It is in my best interest to inform you that the students at our school need to know what it feels like to help others, therefore I suggest that all students need to perform some kind of community service in order to learn the values of helping others. I have come to realise that some students like helping their community and others do not 'Why should they have to do community service if they don't want to?' you may be asking this question, but ask yourself this, 'Why shouldn't it be important for students to help their community?'. I believe that it is important because it really does prepare students for the future by showing how helpful they can be when they work together to help others.

In addition, I think that community service helps people grow as a person because they learn to rely on others. This is important because in the future when they have a job they are required to work with others and by doing community service they will be prepared for when that time comes. My younger sister, RELATIVE_NAME, goes to SCHOOL_NAME and is involved in community service, as far as I'm concerned I honestly think that it's a good idea because not only does it prepare them for the future, it also helps them to know their fellow students a lot better.

Lastly, I would like to say that community service helps students, and all people in general, to make new friends and build strong bonds. Our community is in shambles because of distrust between our fellow Americans, so why should we let that happen to our students? I don't know why some people would say they could care less about what happens whether it's not having enough time or they don't know what to do. Well, it's time to make a choice, either deprive the younger generation of trust and friendship or help them prepare to make a better future. What's your choice?

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
