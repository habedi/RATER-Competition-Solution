Should you do a project in the summer based on what your teacher tells you? Well, for a start you should because it can benefit you in any point in life, education is essential in life; without it, we wouldn't be able to understand things that we do now and days.Â Students summer project should be teacher-designed assignments because they could focus on just specific topics, they can already have sense of what they will learn for next year class, and it can help students determine what their career will be.

However, some may not agree with this position. Some may argue that students should make their own design for making a project. Student should express themselves and design something that would benefit them or something that they really like. For example, Albert Einstein was famous for being a very intelligent man. He wanted to get smarter every day, and he was getting smarter everyday. He did anything just for his knowledge to grow. He was recognized for being the first person to create a nuclear bomb formula. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, student could focus on just specific topics. When teachers assign you with an assignment, it's easy because you know exactly what to do. When you have a topic for the project you know exactly what to search. Project like these are simple and easy to make, and beneficial for your knowledge. It can take some time but if you focus on the topic it would be easier then not having a topic.

In addition, student can have a sense of what they will learn next year in class. Projects over the summer can help students know what they will learn next year for 9,10,11,and 12 grade. Assignment like this can benefit students for their next school year, they would have a head start of knowledge on any assignments that come to them through out the years. Scientist have shown that every single day that we don't learn new things, we lose 0.06% of our memory.

Finally, students can determine what their career will be. When working in a project, either big or small, it can encourage student to see what they are really passionate about. Sometimes when students working in a project over the summer; they can discover new thing while researching things about the topic, either it's related to science, technology, history, or literature.

In conclusion, Students summer project should be teacher-designed assignments because they could focus on just specific topics, they can already have sense of what they will learn for next year class, and it can help students determine what their career will be. Therefore, teacher-designed projects is a great option because teachers knows whats best for their students and what requirements they need.
