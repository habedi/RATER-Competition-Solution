Driverless cars are an ineviatable result of advancements in technology. It has been estimated that within the next 30 years, most cars in the world will be self operated. The idea of a driverless car sounds absurd to some, but driverless cars might be better that modern cars. Driverless cars are an amazing invention that will revolutionize the world.

Diverless cars will be safer that regular cars. When diverless cars advance to the point that they can operate without human intervention, the cars will opperate without error. Humans are imperfect. No human has perfect judgement. A computer program running the car will make less errors that a human.

Driverless cars will be cheaper than modern cars. As our techology advances, the cost of new technology will decrease. In the aticle, It is mentioned that a radar small enough to fit in a car cost two hundred million dollars. A radar today costs a fraction of that. Since techology is advancing, previously new techologies are becoming cheaper. This will make driverless cars more affordable.

Driverless cars will be cleaner that modern cars. The technology withing the car will allow it to plan the most fuel efficient routes and use less fuel. this will lead to a smaller carbon footprint per car. A smaller carbon footprint per car will drasticaly lower the total carbon emmisions of the world.

Driverless cars will be a reality within a few years. The potential for errorless, clean, and cheap alternatives to modern cars is something we should strive for. With driverless cars, that future is not so much a concept, but an inevitable reality that will change the world for the better.
