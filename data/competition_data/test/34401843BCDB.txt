Dear, Principal yes, i do think every student should have to do community service hours. why shouldn't they.

i do not know of anything more important than helping your environment. if children sit at home and do nothing i don't see why it should be a problem to get up and do some work around the town. if all students really did do this, this world would be such a better place. think about it less killing, more happy people , more educated people and families in the world.

I think the kids who just go home after school should be the ones to have extra hours. even thou they might not like cheering, basketball, soccer. there is something out there for you to do. if the cant figure that out there self then the maybe they need somebody to help them realize that. Community service would be a wonderful way to get or youth involved in the world. the might care about things more. It also will teach younger kids about responsibility.

Why should some kids have to do community service and others shouldn't. all kids should be treated the same way. if some kids don't have to do it then all don't have to do it.

I think you can find time do some community service even if you do have after school activities. No matter how many you have i think you can still find some time.

so i hope you have took this letter into some consideration and have decided to keep community service mandatory. this environment isn't going to clean its self. so that's why we need community service.

sincerely, your favorite student
