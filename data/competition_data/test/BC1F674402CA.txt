When I was younger my mom made me join a musical. I was not very fond of the Idea, but after a while I grew a custom to it. I ended up meeting a lot of new people, and enjoying singing. Extracurricular activities can be fun because there are so many options. Now the principal proposed, "All students are required to be in a extracurricular activities." I agree with his proposal, because you can obtain relationships, stay active, and it would give you a general sense of skill.

For starters, you could have amazing relationships with others. In time those friendships could help you out in the future. You never know if the friend you make will be a celebrity and you could be well known because of them. Through tough times or just for entertainment, it brightens up life to have someone with you.

Second, it would keep you active. Its better to be active than laying on the couch all day doing nothing. It is a known fact that staying active can lead to a longer life span. If you stay active on a daily basis you can be more mobile, and not have to sit in a wheel chair everywhere they go. staying active is something tat keeps your mood up even without you knowing.

Third, it would help with life skills in general. If you needed a job, the skills you learned with the extracurricular activity you did in middle school will help you out. Multiple extracurricular activities look good on collage applications, so when you are applying for a scholarship. And if you have skills you could teach others.

In conclusion, having extracurricular activities as a requirement is great because of the friendships, the general sense of skill, and the fact of being active whether it is your brain that is working or your physical body.Â
