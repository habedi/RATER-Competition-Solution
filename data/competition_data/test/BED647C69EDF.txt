Some schools offer distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferring. In my opinion, those students have more benefit than the others one who attend to a regular school. A regular has a lot of students, and they don't have the time to meet all of their students. However, to attend classes from home is a better idea to those students who don't like to be around of others. To illustrate: no distractions in class, better vocabulary, and choose our time.

To begin with, many students in school are noisy and they distract the class, and our learning too. If we stay at home working in our classes we're going to learn more, because we're focus in what we need to do, and follow the instructions. Sometimes teachers stop the class because other student is playing with their phones or talking with their friends, that's disrespectful for the people who wants to learn. We want to concentrate in our work, or in what we are working on it. That's why is better to take classes at home and working in silent, and in your own privacy.

In addiction, to live out of the city will helps our education, because we don't have to came to the big city to don't learn much as we can learn in our village or in our home. Most of the people who live around the city is less educational then the people who live in rural areas, in the street we only heard bad words, and student learn that, but if we stay at home we're can not learn those words. This happen not only in the streets this happen also in schools too, because some students create their own vocabulary by the new singers. They feel that they looks cool, but the reality is those new singer are losing this new generation, most of the students in high school repeat everything.

Finally, I'm one of person who likes to be at home helping mom when I want; clean the home, and sleep most of the time, sometime I feel myself as a couch of potato, because I wake up and I don't want to do it nothing just continuous sleeping. If we take class online we can choose our own schedule, wake up late, sometimes don't take shower and open the computer to learn new materials. Also, when we don't want to keep working just do something else. In regular school we have to wake up early, sometimes the bus left us, we have to wait of the next one, nevertheless we're late to our first class. In home we will never late we are not going to stress our self thinking that we're going to lose half of the class.

To conclude, more schools should offer those benefits to study online, because we can be safe of some crazy person who want to shooting a school we are not going to be there to suffer that terrible accident if we stay at home. The're a lot of good things to choose study at home, and not going to schools. Some reasons are: learn more, everyday take one different class, going what we really need to do.

However, students will enjoy this programs because they will want to have their own time to study, and pay attention to everything without any distration of other noisy student.
