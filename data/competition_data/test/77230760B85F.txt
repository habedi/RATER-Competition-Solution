Dear principle,

Have you ever had a hobby? If so did you like it? Did it take the stress away from you days? Did someone ever tell you that you couldn't do it cause of your grades? well you have told students that and without there activity's some people would be truly miserable please think about this choice.

You have recently decided to change the school policy of how students should have a B average to participate in sports or other school activity's . I am a student in this school and i believe that this is a very bad decision. Many people in this school have a C average grade and they are in school activity's . If you chose to go along with this choice you will truly crush many kids dreams.

If a child is failing a class I don't think anyone has the right to tell them they can not do what they truly love. If a student is failing you should give them tutoring not punish them. If you have not yet changed your mind please sir think about it. When an infant goes to school as a little boy he may have a dream. A dream to some day become someone for instance a basketball player. If that child can not go on and live what we call the dream or most people prefer the American dream. I truly think that on that day hope is lost.

Please principle put your self in this situation. What if you were a kid and you wanted to be a famous actor. You loved acting and you would do anything for it. Then someone came along and said you can make it you wont make it because you are not eligible. Imagine the intensive depression and the embarrassment of going home and telling you mother and father that you didn't make it. I for one would be devastated.

I have had a hobby sir. And someone told me i couldn't make and i should just give up. I thought school was supposed to help a kid in there time of need but in this system in which you are trying to accomplish no one will have the right to be some one. I hope this letter has gotten to you and i hope you think about it.

Thank you for your time STUDENT_NAME
