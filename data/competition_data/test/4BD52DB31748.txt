There are people from all around the world that go to school even if it's in person or virtually. Whether or not they learn from those classes that they attend is up to the student to decide. Some students can't visualize the point of going to class in person, so they decide to take classes online because it's a more convenient way to learn. On the other hand, other students prefer to go to school in person either because they don't have access to virtual classes at home, or it's just easier for them all around. Students have access to a learning experience, and the way they accomplish it is up to them.

Virtual classes has it's ups and downs when it comes to learning a subject. They are missing the social aspect which face to face classes have, whether it's with other students or a teacher that is right there in front of you speaking to you personally. If you are doing classwork that the virtual class assigned you, but you don't know a specific part of the classwork, to some students it's easier for them to ask the teacher, but when you're doing it virtually, there is nobody there to help you. Virtual classroom students will naturally have more experience finding ways to learn in their own way, but a face to face classroom student will have multiple sources of help because there is a teacher and other students in the classroom with them. In a normal classroom there are more people to help you understand a certain subject whether it's with physical examples or it's simply just verbal.

Some virtual classroom websites are hard to navigate through. Websites that use virtual classroom most of the time have multiple tabs to look through with more sections to investigate. A student can easily get lost looking for a specific section where they need to turn in their work that they've have completed. When a student gets lost on where to turn something in at school, they can simply just raise their hand or just ask a student sitting near them where to go to complete the task. Locations in a classroom are pointed out by markings or labels either when you need to turn something in or if you need to go to a place to complete your work.

If you go to school, but also take a virtual class online, you could easily be overloaded with work. When taking an online class, most of the time they require you to do more work than normal since it's less time in the class because you have actual school work. But, if you're in a class then you'll receive a normal amount of work that you get on an everyday basis, but when you get home to do your virtual class work, you'll have a lot more due to the extra work they provide you to do. Virtual class ensure you get more work to learn what is taught in a regular class, but there is less time for learning, and more time for work that was barely taught. Virtual class will for sure fill up your schedule, but student athletes or students with other extracurricular activities will not have time to do their designated hobbies they like to do.

A student can easily forget that they have a virtual class to attend to. Virtual classes can easily be forgotten or put to the side due to the class being on the student's availability or how motivated they are to work. If a student is not feeling motivated to work, then they'll most likely put that work off to the side and procrastinate on getting the work done, or just forget about it. A student's motivation to work in some scenarios is based on how much sleep they got the night before, but if they received a lot of work from their virtual classes, then chances are they didn't get enough sleep as they would've gotten if they went to school in person. A student at school can be reminded by other classmates or by the teacher if they had a project due or not, but a student doing a virtual class will have no reminders and will have to be responsible enough to remember to do their assigned work.

When doing a virtual class, there can be many distractions at home. Your parents can be a large factor as a distraction. Parents want their kids to help around the house, such as doing chores and taking out the dog. If you have siblings, a lot of the time they can randomly come into your room and repeatedly ask you questions regarding their own problems. If you're at school, yes there may be distractions, but there is a teacher there to keep you on track with your work. The teacher at a school will almost never try to distract you while you work, because they encourage you to get your work done in a timely manner.

Virtual classes can be tough for some students to do. There is a lot of work to be done, especially if the student is also doing classes in person along with virtual classes. Students need to learn and have a social life, but not one or the other. Going to a school in person is more beneficial to a student's learning due to others around them and the material they have access to. Virtual school can be difficult for some students, and that's how it can be sometimes, but physical school can be challenging too but there are ways to get help with it. School is a large portion of people's lives and it shouldn't be wasted.
