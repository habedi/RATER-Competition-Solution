Google Recently came out with Google cars Or smart cars, Cars that can drive themselves. A few negative aspects are that These cars can crash easily if not used properly

These cars tend to vibrate when backing into an object so they can be a bit hazordous. Many of these cas can be explained to cause numerous amounts of crashings and such so people need to be aware that these cars aren't very good or as you could say that professional, So people should start looking at using normal everyday cars rather than Smart cars because you never know what could happen with cars like this. Many people believe that this car will be easy because you could sit back relax and text or watch Netflix but the cars may not be that Well and Improved so you never know what could happen so you would still have to watch out for other Vehicles, Animals ,Humans Etc.

So what i'm saying is if you get a google car chances are you may not be as impressed as you think so be careful on what decisions you make.
