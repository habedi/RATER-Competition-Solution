In the world that we live in now, many people use cars to get around like getting to work, schooling, and some just go for fun, or the experience of it. In our world, these vehicles are causing a very big issue in our lives. Cars are not great for our enviornment, without them we would be able to be more eco-friendly, be healthier, and keep eachother more safe. Cars are not the only way to get around!

Using cars may help up get around more often, but notice how many accidents people get into. Running into someone`s bumper, not being carefull, and some times even driving under the influence, are all very dangerous ways you can get injured in a car. Vehicles are a way to get around quickly, but imagine being stuck in traffic for hours and only moved a mile because someone was not paying attention and ran into a street light. We were born with feet to walk. Walking short distances to the store, or market, where ever you wish to go is better than being stuck in a pile of reckless drivers. You can get there in a safer mannor than you would if you were to take a car.

There are plenty of way to get around, other than cars suck as bikes, any kind of skateboards, rollerblades, unicycling, there is a whole list. Not only do these help the enviornment, but they give you a nice workout. Most do it for their health, some to help them acheive a goal. A simple walk to the store, can help with a plethora of thing that are very important to your body. While doing this healthy habit, you get plenty of fresh air, with can reduce stress, and help your body in ways that will give you a feeling a peace in mind.

Let`s talk about the world, we know how to stay healthy. Does our world? It cannot take care of itself. The people who live in it are the ones who provide the maintenence. Without using cars, the gas that they realese will not bother our enviornment. As said in source 1, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the US." 50%? That`s half! If these gasses continue to damage our enviornment, our world will be very unclean.

For generations, cars were known to impress. Even now, people still have cars shows, or gatherings to display their vehicles. The better your car was, the more attention you were receiving. On the other hand, many people have chosen to take the better way out of it and find other ways to get out of using them. Car pooling is another option. Not many people do it, but when its is absolutly needed, that is one option. Keeping everyone happy and healthy, including this planet, is a very important thing that we can do.
