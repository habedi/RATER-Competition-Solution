I think that community service is a great way to keep our city strong, clean and organized but when it is assinghed to people for legal punishment it gives people the wrong idea about it, For an example if your riding your bike and you noticed some prisoners on the high way picking up trash would you want to do that no because it gives people the wrong mind set about it making them think that its a horrible job to be picked to do. To make some one do something is to make them hate it, to incourage some one to do some thing is to make a posibility. community service shouldn't be about punishment it should be about helping out without getting money or rewarded, because in the end it helps us all financualy and community wise but offcourse you don't have people jumping up and down for it and because of the simple fact as its not looked as helping out our community its looked as a singh of punishment and allways have been. people have no problem avoiding something especialy when it comes to work. so why not try to explain how it will help us and benefit our needs for the future. If more people recycle their would be less pollution in our atmosphere and we wouldent have to make as many things as we do over and over like plastic bottles. and paper,because paper comes from trees just like our oxygen which is very important if we keep cutting down trees we wont hsve any air, which is how we breath.
