The use of technology reading facial expressions can be good and bad, so i cant disagree with this or agree with this. I say this because the good side of technology reading facial expressions is that it can help students who do school work on they computer which is stated in the story. It could help students lik me who do there classes on computuer by helping us stay into the lessons. It can help stay focused by if the computer see that we are bored or angry it could change the lesson by making it more fun. It could also help with ads that are played when your going threw the internet. It does these by showing a ad, when this ad is showed it see how u react. If you dont like the ad it will show something diffrent next time but if u like it would show something simliar. But the reason i say it is bad because it could have no use for some people who only use there computers for communication with other people. Byt at the end i can say it wouldnt be a bad idea for them to make computuers that can tell your your emotions because im a student who do classes on the computer
