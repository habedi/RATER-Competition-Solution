Dear Principal,

I believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.

Look at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.

Sincerely,
