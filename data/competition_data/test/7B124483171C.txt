A classroom with the use of this technology would be a classroom of supieriority. This new techonology could greatly improve students´ abilities to learn. Often students are protrayed as being happy or content during a lesson, but really, they are confused. The FACS, Facial Action Cosing System, is an advanced piece technology that can help students with their school work and can be very valuable in the classroom.

The FACS is a computer coding system that allows computers to be able to read the facial expressions of humans. According to the passage, the process in which the computer recognizes the feelings of a human begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face. Each and every muscle movement of the face can detect the exact emotions of any person. For example, the zygomatic major, a muscle that begins at the cheek bones, lift the corners of the mouth when someone is genuinly happy. The FACS system is incredible at calculating any person's emotions and can cause the computer to adapt to anyone's liking.

It is not unusual for a student to "fake" their way through a lesson just to make it seem like they are "okay" when really they are misunderstanding everything that is being taught. According to the passage, this new techonology system is able to recognize the facial expressions of students as they work through an assignment on the computer. It interprets if the student is understanding the material or not. Through a slight frowny face or a confused face, the computer can tell that the student is not able to comprehend what is going on. In return, the computer program may change the lesson to make it slightly easier on the student until it detects a content face. This face will trigger the computer so that it is able to recognize that the student is now understanding the lesson. The program can act as an individual instructor for each student in order for the student to meet their needs.

From this technology, the student will not only have an advantage, but the teacher will as well. Instead of individually tying to speak to kids if they need help, the computer can do it for them. Sometimes, it can get tough and frustrating for a teacher to try to meet the needs of each unique student. With the help of the technology, students can obtain their specific needs on their own. This will relieve a great deal of stress that teachers may carry on their shoulders, and would be very beneficial towards them.

The FACS is a valuable piece of technology that can assist many in the classroom. Lessons will be adapted to meet the students needs when they are confused, becasue the facial recognition program will pick up on their moods. Also, teachers will no longer need to try to teach the lesson several different ways for each different student to understand it. This program greatly advances the students´ learning and acts as a helping hand for teachers.
