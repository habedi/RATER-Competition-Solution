The article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" makes me claim that this technology should be used to read students emitonal expressions to help them with their learning. In the begiining of the article it talks about how the new software can detect emotions of others. At first it sounded weird to have your face scanned to see what your emition is. But it later makes sense later on why you should have face scanned to see your emtotion.

Later in the article it talks about how the facial reconition can help you through out your life. For example paragraph 6 sentence 4 for says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could moditfy the lesson ,like an effective human instructor." So when I read that it makes more sense to do that becuse not all teachers will not know if a student will understand a question or lesson. Or some students are scared to say they dont understand a question or lesson because they might be scared to speak up. But with a facial scanner no student will not need to be scared to ask if they don't understand a question. Plus not all student's learn the same way, so if a student doesn't understand something becuase the way its being taught the Facial Action Code System can scan their face and find another way to help slove the problem.

In conclusion I find Facial Action Coding System as a postive impact for students. Its the latest tech so its not an old system. The scanner can tell if a student doesn't understand a problem. And find another problem to help them. Also knows your emoitions on how you feel about certian things or if you need help on something.
