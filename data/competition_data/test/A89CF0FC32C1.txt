Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have been informed that you will be reviewing and choosing one of two policies regarding the subject of cell phone use in our school. The first is that you will permit students to have their phone in school to use them while they are at lunch and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The second policy is that you will not permit students' cell phones to be at school at any time. I respect each policy and see the positives and negatives of both, but I believe that the first policy would be the better decision and benefit our school the most.

Although the world got along just fine without them before, cell phones have become a vital part of society today. Using a cell phone is a fast and easy way to communicate with others from anywhere around the globe. During school, sometimes you need to be in touch with someone about meeting up at lunch or what your plans are after school. Without cell phones, you would not be able to text or call this person, and it would be hard to make plans at all. Sure, some kids may just be texting their friends about some gossip, but that should not stop cell phones from being allowed to be used at school.

I know that I find myself needing to contact either one of parents about a ride home from school or a game being canceled often. There are land-line phones in classrooms, but teachers seldom allow you to use them to call home or another line unless there is an emergency. Without a mobile phone, you could not get in touch with your parents regarding an emergency or just something they need to know.

Finally, something that is very positive about the first policy is the last part, stating that all cell phones must be turned off during class time. I understand that phones can be very distracting during class when students are texting and not paying full attention to what the teachers are saying. Although it is fortunately rare, some students even text each other the answers to worksheets or tests and get away with it. This is completely inappropriate and should not be permitted in our school. That is another reason why I believe that the first policy is the better choice.

I believe that the first policy regarding cell phone use would be the most beneficial to our school and the students and teachers in it. Cell phones are important for contacting people such as peers or our parents during school. But, they should not be turned on during class time, as the policy entails. I think that most of my peers would agree with the position that I hold. I hope that you will consider my ideas and thoughts on why I believe the first policy is best.

Thank you,
