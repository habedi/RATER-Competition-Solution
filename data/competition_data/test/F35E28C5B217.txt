Dear,senator

I think you should vote on abolishing the Electoral College because it's obviously dumb.

First of all,they can be anybody which i believe is just wrongIt should be somebody who wants to be in it and works hard to do so.

Secondly,it makes zero sence what so ever that bigger states get more electoral votes because it's not fair to the other people in the state who want the other guy to win but that doesn't matter if it's the winner takes all syestem. Winner takes all system make no sence at all either. You shouldn't go by that if it's not what the people want. For example,in the year 2000 Gore won the popular vote or the vote the people wanted,and Bush lost. But since Bush won the electoral vote he became the president.

So what you are trying to say is that the peoples vote doesn't count when choosing the person that will help run this country? That is terrible! Instead of going by how big the state is and how many electoral votes they get it shiuld be the popular vote or the peoples vote!

Sincerely,

Chris
