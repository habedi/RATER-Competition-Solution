Even though Venus has been said to be uninhabital, the author supports his idea of studying Venus enough that would want to make people study it.

The author uses logos to prove that Venus is worthy of being studied by stating factual evidence from NASA. NASA is the best place to get information of planets like Venus and thats what the author did and he got that Venus is, "[a]t thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"(5). The evidence would help perssuade people to do it because it shows that Venus used to be exactly like Earth, and we would want to explore the planet and find out anything about what happened there and how we could stop earth from doing that.

In conclusion the author would defently be able to perssuade everyone that Venus would defently would be a great planet to explore and find more physical evidence about Venus and what has gone down with it and how it could of all happened.
