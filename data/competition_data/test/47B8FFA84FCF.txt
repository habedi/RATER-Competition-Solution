The author explains venus very well. he describes the atmospher on the planet and the tempreratures on the planet as well. it would be very difficulet to land there because it is very hot. i have seen images from the planet and the ground is very valcanic looking and you cant see very well cause of the atmospher. The planet gets very hot during the day and very cold there during the night as well. its kinda neet to look up at night on planet earth and see all the stars and planets out there. I have seen venus a couple of times and the author is right it is very bright. The reason we cant land their the author sates that it has sulfiric asid for the atmospher and the author is right. A prob was sent there and it only lasted a few hours. The author done a good job at studying veuns and its a good idea to pursuit it.
