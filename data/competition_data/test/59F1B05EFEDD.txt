Imagine finding what looked like to be an alien monument on a different planet. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, Cydonia, and taking photos of possible landing sites for Viking 2. The spacecraft took a photo of a landform that looked like a human head. NASA sent out the image for everyone to see and it got a lot of attention. People have started making assumptions as if that proves there is life on other planets, it was an Egyptian Pharaoh, and many more. NASA proved that there was no alien monument, but not everyone agreed. The landform on Cydonia is not an alien monument.

Many people think that this landform on Cydonia is an Egyptian or alien landform. The text states,"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added."So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" NASA concludes that the landform is just a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. Jim Garvin compared the landform to the Middle Butte in Idaho. Garvin found that they were about the same height. The face is a landform that has shadows casting on it to give it the form of a face.

In conclusion, the landform on Cydonia is just a mesa with shadows casting on it that make it look like a face. NASA has taken many photos to prove this evidence and has compared this to other mesas on Earth. Many people still don't believe the proven evidence and still believe they are alien monuments. People believe the markings of aliens were hidden by a haze, so NASA took photos on clear days to prove that it is just a mesa. The face on Cydonia is just a mesa and not an alien monument.
