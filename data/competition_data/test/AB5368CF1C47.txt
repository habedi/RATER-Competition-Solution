I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join because you could be helping the lives of the lives of thousands of innocent people whose homes where destroyed in the wars. One of the interesting things of joining the program is that you can see a amazing sights from all around the world.

It is an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Helping these people you can get the benefit of going to China and Europe and their famous landmarks. If you go to Italy there is a chance you could ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. When i was in Crete is saw an excavated castle. On your way to China you can marvel your eyes at the Panama Canal. If your not in the mood for sight seeing you can go downstairs with some of you co-workers and play some baseball,volleyball,fencing,boxing,reading,whittiling,and Table-tennis to help pass the time while on board.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me and was vey grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of peolple in other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me for along time. It lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. If you had any job or chore working on a farm then this job will be great for you.

When your on night watchman duty be careful when it rains. Because when I was on night watchman duty it was raining cats and dogs. I was climbing down a ladder when my foot slipped and I fell in my side. I nearly slid stright off the deck. But before i could fall i grabbed on to a piece of metal before i could fall off. I couldn't work for a few days because of a few cracked ribs. But if you do join just know that your co-workers are there to help you with injuries.

In conclusion, I think that you should join our Seagoing Cowboy program.

Not only will you be helping us by joining but you will also help innocent lives of people who were harmed in the war.
