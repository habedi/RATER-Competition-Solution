Well the author is saying that Venus is the most like Earth than any other planet we have seen. Venus has oceans covering a bunch of the planet. The author also explains that there could be various forms of life that could be living on Venus, but we don't have any information because Venus is a super hot planet and when we send something down to land on the planet it melts or gets destroyed just because how hot it is.

Since Venus has a possibility of life I think we should keep investigating this extremely hot planet to see what it has to offer. If there is any life on Venus we need to keep exploring the planet to see where the planet leads us and if we don't find any signs of life then I say we move on to another planet and just keep exploring. NASA is saying that they are looking for ways to further investigate the planet and take notes on what they see.

So therefore, Venus is the most like Earth and NASA is trying to figure all the ways to find information about the planet and see if there is any life or it's just a dead planet. This author has kind of the same mindset as me and what I think we should do and figure out things.
