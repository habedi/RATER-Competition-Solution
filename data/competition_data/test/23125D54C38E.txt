In today's society, technology is used everyday all over the world. Teenagers are glued to their smart phones. Since children use technology so much, why not make them use it for educational purposes? If they could use their devices as educational resources, they would learn so much more. Many schools are debating whether students would benefit from taking their classes from home using their computers or other devices. Students would benefit more from taking classes from home rather than school because, they can learn at their on pace, be in a comfortable environment, and it teaches students more then just the curriculum.

To start off, teachers in schools teach at a fast pace and continue without the year whether all the students understand or not. By being able to take classes online at home, students will be able to take their time to really understand the curriculum. Most students cannot retain information in a ninety minute class period, moving from topic to topic without a check for understanding. Failing grades and test scores are a result of the lack of understanding the material. Today, most students do not fully learn; they try to do enough to just pass. Allowing students to take classes at home will not only improve their grades, but make schools bout learning again.

Secondly, students would be able to learn in a comfortable environment. It can be hard to focus on learning if a person is not comfortable in the room they are in. Most schools are older which means the classrooms are not the best. The rooms are small with dim lights and little to no windows. The dirty cement walls and moist air makes it harder to focus. While at home, students have fresh air and decorated rooms that they feel comfortable in. A person's environment can change their mood and thought process. A good, comfortable environment, in which people feel safe in, expands the mind and eagerness to learn. A good learning environment is critical to education.

In addition to the previous statement, taking classes from home teaches students more then just the curriculum. For example, by taking online classes from home, it teaches students how to prioritize and manage their time better. Students would have to make their own schedule and plan when they will get their assignments done as well as having a personal life. Students will learn how to use technology for more than just social media and games. It gives insight on how life will be once they graduate and have a career. Online classes give them control of their education which prepares them for life outside of school.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why students would benefit from taking online classes. Most students would love the opportunity to be able to take their classes from home. It is more convenient for students and families who need their child to work or take care of the household. This is a great way to prepare students for future careers and life in general. Technology is advancing more and more everyday. It is time we use newer devices in the education system to better the learning experience for students.Â
