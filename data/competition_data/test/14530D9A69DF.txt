I think teaching how to do this to students is a very good idea. Because if we teach this to students we can tell if a person is having a dad day and you can help them out or not. You could also tell if someone is happy or sad. You could tell if they are havin g a dad day and you could try and make them have a good day. You could tell if someone was having suicidle thoughts or is just joking. If you see someone that is happy you could try and keep them happy all day. The author also tells you could not do this with your home PC because it coundn't handle the complex algorithms that you would need for this to work. He tells you what muscles to look for that are bieng used if you try this on a lab partner. He tells you what muscles that are needed for a genuine smile and what muscles to look for on a forced smile. Like in a real smile the person would be using Zygomatic major(muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. But in a false smile the person would be using the muscles called the Zygomatic muscle and the risorius muscle also.
