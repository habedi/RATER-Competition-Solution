Many students today do not participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are very common, but many kids do not participate in them. Participating in extracurricular activities has many different benefits and can help a student in many different ways. After school activities should be required in every school. Extracurricular activities can benefit a student in many ways it can teach students responsibility, it can help students make new friends, and can help students gain a hardworking mindset.

For example, learning how to be responsible is a life lesson everyone will need. Therefore, students should be required to participate in some type of after school activity because while participating in a sport you have to be responsible enough to have all your equipment ready for your practice so you are prepared. Participating in a club will also teach a student responsibility because the student will be responsible of knowing when and where the meeting is. Another big responsibility students will have while participating in extracurricular activities is time management. While participating in other things besides school being a good student will always be first. Students will have to be responsible in managing their time right so that you will still have time to complete their homework and any other things while still practicing daily for their upcoming games or being active in their club.

Another reason extracurricular activities are beneficial to students is because students will have a chance to meet new friends. Many kids find it difficult to step outside their comfort zone and meet new friends. Clubs and Sports can help students meet lifelong friends. Personally I have met some of my closest friends on a softball field or in beta club. Extracurricular activities can help these kids fell less overwhelmed about making new friends while also participating in after school activities.

Lastly, after school activities can benefit a student by helping them gain a hardworking mindset. In sporting activities athletes always want to be able to beat there competition but to do this they have to have a hardworking mindset. Athletes also always want to be one of the best on the team but to do that each individual athlete will have to have a hard work ethic to practice, study the game, and improve. A hardworking mindset can also be gained in clubs because while participating in a club you want to be able to win at any of the competitions you participate in but to do so, you have to work to improve and work to be the best. A hardworking mindset will also be beneficial in the classroom because hopefully students will have that same mindset towards improving and getting good grades. Overall a hard work ethic will always be needed to accomplish any goals in life.

In conclusion after school activities should be required. kids can learn responsibility, meet new friends, and gain a hardworking mindset all while participating in after school activities and being active. Participating in at least one after school activity should be required in all schools. After school activities will always be beneficial in many different ways, whether you are participating in a sport or a club it will still be very beneficial to a student.
