In some schools students are required to do projects over summer break to ensure their students are still learning. While most students will tell you this sounds like the punishment of the century, there is a way to make this experience fun for students. If they can design their project it gives them countless opportunities and ways to succeed. Most students enjoy learning when it is something they're interested in the subject. If students are given the freedom to design their own project, then they will be more interested, have the freedom to be creative, and have the opportunity to complete the project by learning in a way which is most effective to them.

Having students design their own projects gives them the opportunity to learn about what they're interested in. To some students going to a museum may be super fun and to others it may be getting lifeguard certified. Both are terrific learning experiences, but display completely different interests. Students overall are more likely to do their work and be invested in projects they are interested in. It can be argued that giving students control over their projects will make them much harder to grade. While this is true, giving a student a chance to do a project on something they are passionate about is a much better learning experience than having them write a research paper on information that is not applicable to their life and does not interest them. Giving students the ability to design their own projects lets them research things they are interested in, making learning more fun for them.

Everyone learns in a different way. This is information schools have known for years. Giving students the opportunity to design their own projects provides freedom to learn however is best for them. If they learn best from lectures, they can take a class. If they learn best hands on, they can go out into the world and do whatever they choose for their subject. The possibilities are endless. Many would say it is much easier to standardize these projects, and while this is accurate, giving the students the freedom in this project will give them the opportunity to experience new types of learning and comprehend the information they are receiving better, because they are learning in the way best suited for them.

Giving this choice to students provides them with the opportunity to design their project in a way that highlights their strengths. Students are very creative people whether it be in art, writing, sciences, or any other subject. For example, if a student is interested in chemistry, they could do anything from creating organic sunscreen to baking. This not only is more engaging for the students, but having fun while doing the project makes the chances much higher of them retaining the information they are learning. While this would not be very organized, the goal is to have students retain the information and learn.

If one of my teachers was to tell me I had to do a project on my summer vacation, I would be furious. However, if I had the opportunity to design it myself, that anger would turn to acceptance fairly quickly. If students are going to be forces to do a project on their vacation, they should have the freedom to design it. This would keep students interested and invested.Â Giving students the freedom to design their own project will result in more interest, more creativity, and the opportunity to complete the project by learning in a way which is most effective to them.
