One ordinary day my friend Don Reist invited me to be a Seagoing Cowboy in Europe. I couldn't say no to that getting to help people and getting an opportunity of a life time. While over there I realized how bad those countries are and how many Seagoing Cowboys they really need. For me the answer was an immediate yes, because there's so many reasons to be in the Seagoing Cowboy's Program.

While I was on the cattle boat trips I got to see Europe and China. Not only that but I got to see the Acropolis in Greece which was so amazing to see and probably my favorite. A gondola ride in Venice, Italy with the city streets made of water. I also had the opportunity to tour a castle in Crete, and saw the beautiful Pana Canal on my way to China. All this beautiful sightseeing is only one of my reasons.

I didn't just go over there for that, I went over there to help. Yes, all those magnificent sights were a blast to see. Yet as an affect of World War ll, there were people with out homes who needed help and food. As a small town boy I only got to have few choices of work, but as a Seagoing Cowboy I went everywhere and got to help people. We helped them by shipping horses, mules, and young cows overseas because they had lost all there animals. While helping I got to sail across the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice. Knowing everytime I sailed across either ocean I was helping someone in need. Which made me feel good and not so much like a small town boy anymore. Lots of Seagoing Cowboys are needed and as you can conclude there are many great reasons to join.
