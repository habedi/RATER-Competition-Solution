Dear Principal,

Well, since the school principal is deciding whether or not to raise the grade average for sports is actually good. Although many students have a grade C average, I would say that if they were to put as much effort as they do in their sports, YES, it would be a good decision.

That is if the students that are on the sports team want to be on the team that bad.

Despite all the anger that may rage through all of the student body, i have met people who do sports and maintain a straight A average.

So in saying, it is never all that hard to maintain a higher grade average, as long as you have the time, to do both, the time management, and mainly, the skills to do any of it.

As long as you have all of those things, then you don't have to worry about much.

I'm stating that, if students currently have a grade C average, then they should be able to put that extra work into it for their own benefit, not the benefit of the school.

Realizing all that could be done with such a step-forward, if this were to go to let's say, all public schools, then there would be students that would walk that extra mile.

If students would decide they really want something, just think on how much the national report card would rise.

Everything involving school would be effected -- in a good way.

Despite all of the controversy that may rise throughout the student body, it's for their own benefit, and for the nation's benefit as well.

So my answer is, YES, this would be a good idea. Though i would suggest the schools rise the average slowly, such as C-->C+-->B.

In that type of way, so the students would be able to accept what is happening more clearly.

This would be a huge benefit in almost everything, ranging from the stock market to the nation.

This would also call for more responsibility, and overall, more genius flowing through the veins of this nation.
