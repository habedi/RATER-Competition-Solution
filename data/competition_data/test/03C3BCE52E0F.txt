Self-driving cars use to be considered a thing of the future, however the future is now and companies such as Google, GM, Audi, and many other are realising that. It might just be time for the public to realise that as well. Driverless cars are coming and that is a great thing. Driverless cars would not only help the ederly and disabled, but also those who cannot, or do not, want to drive themselves.

The need for an alert drivers suggests that maybe these cars should start off as some sort of public transportation system such as taxis, "This means the human driver must ramain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires" (paragraph 7). There may even need to be training for the driver to know how to handle such an advanced vechicle, "They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents" (paragraph 7). the delveopment of such vehicles, while slow, could help many elderly and disabled. If a man in a wheelchair needed to go to the store he could simply call someone and a Google Car would be over quickly, with a driver to take over should anything happen. However, saftey is the main priority, so sensors should always be up to date and a well trained technician in the feild of Google Cars should always be present. The technician on hand should always be alert, also. The sensors need to be obvious and creative enough that said technician can easily distingush what is happening and what to do should an incident arise, "GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and oher heads-up displays" (paragraph 7). The saftey of all passengers, other vehicles, and all padestrians is key to the advancement of driverless cars. For now, however, the creators of such cars should focus on making them legal, "Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars" (paragraph 9). Once the companies that are trying to create these computer-driven cars get past the legal barriers, the advancement of self-driving cars will boom and a new future for public and private transportation with emerge.

Self-driving cars could help many people such as the ederly, the disabled, and those who just don't feel like driving today. Computer-based cars can no longer be caled a thing of the future, because the future is now.
