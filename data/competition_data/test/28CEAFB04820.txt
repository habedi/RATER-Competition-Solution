Hey Luke here, in your childhood have ever wanted to be a cowboy or wanted to sail the seven seas?

Well why not be both with our Seagoing Cowboys program. I did it and it chaged my life forever.

You can enjoy being the best of both worlds while helping others.

It may be dangerous, but so is everything else. People need us, but we need you to help us.

You may wonder why should I help people I don't know? here are some of the things I saw and did that you will be able to do too.

You can see many parts of the world like China or Europe.

Also you may see Acropolis in greece or take a gondola ride in Venice.

Maybe even Italy with sreets of water, or Creete with its Panama Canal.

Also if you are 18 or older this counts as military service, and when it comes down to it it's more safe to deliver suplies on a boat than be in the battle lines of war.

Plus You are helping people around the world by delivering important suplies like horses, young cows, and mules. Though you will have to feed alot of horses you'll be ok. I fed 335 horses and I was ok.

In concusion that is why you should be a seagoing cowboy. You will see parts of the world you never seen before, you'll be serving your country, and you will help people around the world. Join and you won't regret it, I didn't and you wont ether I promise. We need more Seagoing Cowboys for our program.

This is Luke Bomberger saying will you be the man or woman to anwser our call?
