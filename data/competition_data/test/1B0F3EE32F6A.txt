I feel that the idea was outgoing but you cant hold technology forever or always profound it as good yes I can be valuable and a pretty cool equmeint. But to say if this facial action coding can be relibel and give you accurte resluts is hard to believe. because just cause a machine tells you one thing doesnt mean its ture one can be happy and it can show the person mad. I just think for a fun a silly thing to try or do yes its valuable. But for something to speak on as if it acutlly works and did work and is giving accurte resluts no its not valuable. Like he said " she was 80 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. Yes you can have a lot of mixed emtions but to have one after another by a machine telling you come on now. it then again could be ture but I couldnt see that unless she presented that to us her self how she was really feeling at that moment and time.
