No I don't agree with this decision and here are a few reasons why I disagree.

Some student may not have time for these activities. For example, if a student needs extra help or a tutor they will have less time to get the help they need to succeed. If the students are required to take these activities it will consume their time to learn. This will eventually cause their grades to drop and possibly fail classes.

Another reason is they will have less time with their family. Family is very important especially as a child, but extracurricular activities may give them less family time. If a student has is on a sports team and has late practices this will tire them and they will not get to interact with their family as much. Which may cause the student to be antisocial.

My final reason is the workload. Students already have tons of work to do but they will have even more with the extracurriculars .Some students may have so much work to do they can't really get it done. This work will continue to pile up and may cause unwanted feelings like stress and anxiety. This can mess up the mindset of the student and they may want to move to another school or drop out.

These are reasons why I disagree with extracurricular activities being required.
