Dear Principal,

I think that to participate in sports or other activities you should have to remain at a grade C average. C is the average grade for a student. Some people have trouble maintaining a grade C average and still like to participate in sports or other activities.

A grade B is above average for students. Many student may have trouble keeping up with there work for grade

B average just continue to sink there grades down. A higher average then a grade C is just not necessary for these students.

A study club would benefit both ways, either a grade C average or a grade B average. A study club is a chance after school for students to get help on there work. If one students grades are bad because he is having trouble understanding his work, a study club would help with that because then teachers could help him after school to get his work done and handed in on time.

My last reason is that students do not need to be pushed that hard to be able to do what they love to do. Most school you have to have a C average to play in sports. Considering that is hard for some students to make, so a B would make it almost impossible for certain students. Most of the students also play sports or participate in other related activities.

In conclusion, I would say that maintaining a grade C average is already enough for students. Most of the students now have a grade C average and a couple have a grade B average. I would say that a grade C average suits are students just fine.
