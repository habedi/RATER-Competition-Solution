There are many ways to explore Venus with the challenges on the way and some of those ways are how Venus is covered with atleast a 97% carbon dioxide, and then finally how Venus is sometimes refered to as earths twin.

The author states in the story called " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" that there is ways on being able to explore and learn more about Venus. Venus has a lot of carbon dioxide on it that its as thick as a blanket. In paragrapgh 3 it states that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. In this quote " Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." This quote means that Venus has a lot of information to offer the people if they want to learn more about Venus and how thick the atmosphere is also how the atmosphere of Venus has sulfuric acid.

In the story it states that Venus is refered to as one of Earths twin since its close to the planet earth. Venus being called Earths twin is a way of saying how Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. This quote, " Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds." This quote means that the reason why Venus is refered to as Earths twin is because it has a lot of things in common with other planets like Mars, and Earth itself that are also refered to as Earths twin most of the time.

There are many ways to explore Venus with the challenges on the way and some of those ways are how Venus is covered with atleast a 97% carbon dioxide, and then finally how Venus is sometimes refered to as earths twin. So that is what evaluates how well the author supports the idea that stuying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Also so people can learn about the planet Venus more but to also be able to explore the planet aswell after they have learned about it so they can try to stay out of danger while being up there on Venus.
