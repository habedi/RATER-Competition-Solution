Have you ever seen an ambulance or two with a few cop cars rushing by and thought what's going on? Many people who are caught up in these types of situations do it to themselves by using their phones, causing accidents and injury that shouldn't have happened. This needs to stop, maybe even be helped if it can't be stopped.

Many people get upset when new rules coming out trying to limit phone use while driving. This shouldn't be the case though as they are just trying to prevent any unnecessary injury. This could also mean time in jail for the driver for being on his or her phone in the first place. This again causes unnecessary problems that could be avoided. The person who was using their phone would also have to pay a fee for the damages to the vehicle or even the person.

Another reason people shouldn't be able to use cell phones all the time is because there's always a time where and ambulance is driving by or even a cop. Most people would pull to the side. On the other hand, if your blasting and unaware of your surrounding because your using your phone you wouldn't be able to hear them unless they were right next to you. This could cause injury to whoever they were rushing to get to. If it was a cop It would be bad for the driver blasting music too. Not being able to use the phone keeps you safer and out of trouble.

A way to make it somewhat safe for phone use however is to have a Bluetooth connection in the car. This is a pretty good compromise. People can just use their car to control phone needs. All calls can be answered and texts can be read without looking at a phone. This will keep the person safe and make looking at the phone less of a problem. This however wouldn't stop all problems which is why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in capacity while driving.

In conclusion driving around in general isn't the safest thing ever. Adding an extra distraction that makes driving even more dangerous isn't smart. People shouldn't be mad at laws made because people make bad decisions while driving. Laws are made to keep us safe so if a law to not let people use phones it would help stop accident and other unnecessary injuries or problems.
