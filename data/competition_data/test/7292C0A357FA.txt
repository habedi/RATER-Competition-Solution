Should cell phones be used at school?

Should cell phones be used? I strongly suggest we use the first policy because at lunch or snack is our free time and we should be able to use our phones. My first reason for this believe is because students can text other students instead of walking across the whole quad just to talk to your friend. people may think its a bad idea because phones will be ringing but that's why the cell phones have vibrate or silent. Teachers may argue about phones going off in class but they can simply tell the students to check their phone to see if its off and if it rings in class the teachers can take it away.

They should have a small rule like if your phone rings 1 time in class then its a warning then if it rings again a different day then it gets tooken away and given at the end of the period or end of school. The third time means you cant bring your cell phone to school anymore but only for that person. People may say that it will be a distraction but i still think that it is a great idea to use cell phones at school during our free time.
