Dear principal,

I am 100% sure policy 1, as my view as a big texter, will be the best. Do the teachers need to be offended if it's lunch period, and someone's texting? No, they should not be offended if that happens. How about in the hallway? Once again, no.

Think of it like this, you got a test back, 105% (because of extra credit) you cannot wait to tell your family. The bell rings. You go out to your locker, grab your phone and text your parents. They are so excited their child turned out bright. Well, I have gotten tests back where the score is up with the other students' high scores, out of my grade. And I want to tell my mom, so bad.

The cell phones would only interrupt free periods, and lunch. If that even makes sense. Which it doesn't really. Or how about this scenario: You told your friend, who we're going to call RELATIVE_NAME, who lives in a different time zone. Your friend thought RELATIVE_NAME's story was just awesome! RELATIVE_NAME sees the email, (about it being a great story. She's home, at the time) and you're at school with your friend who said it was awesome! Oh Gosh! She wants your friend to see her "thanks" so bad! She emails your phone (simple phones can do email functions) you're in free period and get a text/ email saying: Thanks, and other things about how happy she is, about it. Your friend sees the text and gets happy, as well.

I wish I could do that, because my friend, RELATIVE_NAME, would love to say thanks to my friend, who wanted to text her last night because the story sounded really good. And she's almost out of school, now, and I am at school. Also you will be remembered as the principal who let cell phones be used during free periods and lunch.

Those are the reasons, I believe policy 1 will be best for everyone. Also with the fact, you will win the students' hearts, with the fact they can text during school hours.

P.S. Let MP3s and ipods be allowed in school, just for

Sincerely.
