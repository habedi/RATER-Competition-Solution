Dear principal,

I'm not ok that students have to have a B in there grads to be in sports because some kids don't have good grades and they might feel bad because they cant be in sports. and other students have higher grades and some of them don't like sports. They could be in other activities like in after school club like art, help after school. And that not good that they have to have B. Why cant they have C or other grade? some students love sports and they could be allowed to be in sports. Can they be another activities? A lots of student like to be in others activities just let them be in sports or other things.

Just give the students a changes to get there grads up. And let them have fun with the sports and other things. some times they could stay after and study with the teacher and get there grads up so they could be in activities. That's all I have to say .

your friend,
