It is said that some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the student continues learning during their break. I think that these projects should be student-designed. I feel these projects should be student- designed because it gives the student more to learn about due to it being their ideas, it gives the student more independence, and it allows the student to be mor creative as well. Allowing student-designed projects be possible, gives the students a chance to think for themselves. Giving student this opportunity opens doors for more creativity and descision making.

Being able to create and mold your own ideas, gives students more confidence in their work. Though some students prefer teacher-designed projects, they aren't allowing themselves that chace to come up with and give theirown thoghts and ideas. For example a student who's teacher says they can do a favorite place in the world project would have more excitement and come up with so many different ideas fot he projects, verses a student that is given a certain place to do the project on. Each individual student has their own mind. Allowing these students their own minds and creativity to be used with the projects would show their special abilities.

Another reason students should be allowed to do student-designed projects is because, it allows gives the student the ability to learn more due to it being their idea. Now-a-days students with teacher-designed projects can copy and paste the information. This does not give the stuudent the chance to learn about the information being given. One example would be me being given a teacher-designed project,copy and pasting it without reading one word about what the project was based on; Or being given a project i was able to read about on my own and learn more information about due to my mind being used. Even though some students do not want to think and just think of just giving in the assignment, they are not using their own ideas just ones provided.

The last reason students should be allowed student-based projects is because, they should be allowed the independency to make their own choices and think for themselves. Allowing students to think for themselves prepares them for the real world and choices tthey would make in the future. For example I am being given a chance to either work on a project according to how I want about any topic I want in my class, but my classmate decides to take the teacher-designed project to just get it over with. That classmate isn't allowing themsleves to think on their own and have their oen mindset. Students in the head space of just getting things over with, miss out on alot of opportunities in life because of it.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to express their creativity and reasons for them. Not all students want o be confined to what the teahers allow them to do, especially when it comes to projects. Students showuld be able to show that they know more then hat the teacher does. All in all students can rise to more then the standard of what the teachers think is acceptable. Teachers should allow the students to be creative and expand their minds beyond just projects as well.
