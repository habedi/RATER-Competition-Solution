I believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home through online and video conferencing. Majority of students would say the same thing because they dislike school to some degree.

Students that have anxiety, unease or any other forms of fear would truly benefit from attending classes at home. It would not only make learning more progressive, but it would actually make learning much more fun. The ability to be free and be in place where you are comfortable in, would only make you have more motivation to want to understand and learn that criteria.

Students would also benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that they do not have to get dress or do things to get ready for school. They dont have to waste the parents time or using in exponential of energy walking to school. The amount of time you spend getting ready, switching between classes and going to school can waste a precious amount of time.

Studies have shown that students that have anxiety are prone to be unable to focus during class. The lack of focus would cause the student to be behind in the class and you wouldn't want that. Studies have also shown that students that have anxiety are one of the most talented beings. Albert Einstein and other intelligent beings that we acknowledge, were known to have some form of anxiety. Being alone and learning the criteria in your own pace only makes it easier.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home through online or video conferencing. Students that have anxiety would make learning easier and more efficient. The amount of energy you use when walking to go to class will not be used.
