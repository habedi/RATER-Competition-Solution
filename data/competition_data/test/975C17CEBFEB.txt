In the story Venus is sometimes called the ''Evening Star'' is one of the brightest points in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargaze to spot. The nickname was misleading because Venus is actually a planet. Often referred to as Earth's ''twin'' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus is sometimes around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. On the planet's surface,temperature average over 800 degress Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own plant. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Long ago Venus was maybe or probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Studying to meet the challange presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The author wants to know everything about Venus and will do anything to get the information he wants.
