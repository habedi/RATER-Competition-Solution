The Challegene of Exploring Venus

Venus, sometimes called the "Evening Star" is a planet similar to ours. It is the closest on similiarities to Earth and scientificis plan to explore it. However, it could be a bad idea because it has a lot of pollution, high temperatures and weather problems.

One reason of why exploring venus is a bad idea is the pollution. The text says "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus". It means that there is a great pollution that humans are not able to stand. If people tries to go to Venus they could probably die.

Another reason is that venus has higher temperatures and weather problems. The article says " temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater." It means that the temperatures are stronger than what we can stand. Humans are not used to it so it would be difficult and risky.

One more reason is the weather issues. The article says "Additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthqueakes, and frequent lightning strikes to proves seeking to land on its surface". The weather is a great issue since they could destroy everything. It will be so hard to explore, not even machins would be able to stand a strong weather.

In conclusion, exploring Venus would be a bad idea since it is risky for humans. If you still think that scientifics should explore Venus, you can look for more information on internet.
