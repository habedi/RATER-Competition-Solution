Dear Principal,

I have all of my averages in the 90s and above.

The new policy doesn't affect me but I must say that I strongly disagree.

Many students cannot keep up with their grades, and look towards sports as an answer.

Some people have a natural talent for sports, but their grades aren't as high as a B.

I have played soccer my entire life and other kids my age have been the same with other sports.

In my household, my parents do not tolerate anything lower than a 90% .

I do not know about anyone else, but some people, allow their grades to be in the 80 range.

I find it unfair for a new policy to be at hand because there are kids in this world that are mentally challenged.

What if they were not able to keep up in their class work but they loved to play baseball.

Would that be fair to them?

Would it be fair to not let them play the sport that they love just because they are in the C range?

I understand if they were failing all of their classes, but I feel that raising the standards to a B is kind of harsh.

I am a soccer player who plays for the NJ Stallions.

My team went to the 2010 North American Super-Y Nationals, in Tampa, Florida.

It took a lot of effort and time to get there.

We practice every single day of the week.

Most of the kids on my soccer team have a B average, while the others had a C average.

If that was the school soccer team, the players with the C average, wouldn't be able to go.

What if they were the top goal scorers on the team?

Would you want to be responsible for making the team lose?

Sincerely,
