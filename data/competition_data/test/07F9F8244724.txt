If you waych the news chaces are you probelly hear about cars weither it be from car accidents, to drunk driving, to pollutents from cars. And everyone is in uproar about how do we stop all this stuff from happening well it could as simple as using cars less often. This maybe sound shocking to most people who drive but maybe if we use our cars less there would be less accidents or drunk driving and not to mention less greenhouse gasses. Did you know that 50% of greenhouse gas comes from cars in car-intesive areas in the United States. Thats right 50% of those greenhouse gasses come for your car. I'm not saying we should stop driving cars in general but make an effort to use them less. Like in Bogota Columbia they have a day dedicated to not driving cars and instead using public trainsportation. From doing this they improved there sidewalks, reduced traffic and even upscale restaurants and shopping centers sprouted up. And every year everyone is happy and very ethustiastic about the day. Not only does the less usage of cars make people happy it also makes the likelyhood of car accidents very low since there are no cars on the road.
