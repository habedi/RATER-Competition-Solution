Dear Principal,

I think your idea is a very good one. Our community needs help, and its up to us to fix it.

Kids my age are able to help others and they don't. I think your idea will not only benefit for others, but to the children who make it come true. It could not only make us feel good about ourselves and others, but teach them a valuable lesson needed in life. Let me write more to explain about my opinion.

A lot of my friends like to relax, be with friends, play video games and watch television. Most of that listed can rot our brains. Why couldn't we be with friends while picking up trash... its called multitasking! They could be making new friends by helping out at elderly homes. They could broaden their horizons while having fun. Just because i use my time for community service doesn't mean that they do. Your idea will help them help other people. Why make homemade brownies that are just enough for yourself when you can make more for the homeless shelter? Why not teach our children of America to be more kind? These are questions that are asked and can be improved by your idea, especially if you decide to follow through with it!

Also, a big problem is if they want to do community service but don't know how. You could be assigning projects and organizing times, dates, and places for my friends and the student body. Rewarding the children for doing the jobs would also be a good way to get them active and started. Everyone likes to be praised for doing something right or having good morals. Why not also feel good after a job well done?

Helping our community could make it such a better place. Robbery, theft, and crime could be put to sleep! you never know if these things could influence other people to be good and kind as well. It could make our communities or districts look almost like a utopia. People would feel better, our environment would look better too! Helping others in our communities also helps us.

Overall, you need to follow through with this idea. Your school could also be part of students community service projects. You would be known for helping others in life, this is why it is so important, not only for us... but for others to learn something!` I hope that you take my opinion under consideration. I think there are benefits in it for all of us!

Sincerely,
