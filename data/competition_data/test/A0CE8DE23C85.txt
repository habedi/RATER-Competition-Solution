Dear Principal,

Helping others and our community is a very important matter, but some of the people I associate with disagree. Should they be required to perform community service, or not? I believe that benefiting others by providing a service to the community is a great and honorable achievement. All students at our school should be doing community service and benefiting society.

To further explain my opinion, I will provide an example. My friend does not think that he should pick up any litter that is not his that is on the ground. While my other friend cannot stop picking up the smallest bit of trash in her gated community. She is providing a service to her community and the animals and insects that live in her area. It is important for those animals not to eat or consume any of the litter left on the ground we walk on. Therefore, it is important to those animals to stay alive and be healthy because she picks up the trash and disposes of it in the proper way.

To conclude, community service at our school would benefit students and prevent a dirty campus, tripping, and lazy students. If every student in our school had as much determination, persistence, and concern as my friend, our school would be a great learning environment. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
