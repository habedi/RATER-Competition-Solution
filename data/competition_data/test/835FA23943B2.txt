"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents".

My Claim: Venus is one of the most earh like planets.

Explantion:The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes fimilar features as valleys , mountains , and craters.

Venus is really an earth-like planet thats why researchers are interested in it most. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes fimilar features as valleys, mountains, and craters. Many reaserchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long on venus , so that we can explore more of the earth like features it has. sum things from venus have been took before for testing but didnt last long so reaseachers are also studying on how to make equiment from there last longer. Numerous of factors contribute to venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study,which it is but very worth it. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.(high pressure and heat). venus weather presents additonal impediments like erupting valcone's, powerul earthquakes, and frequant lightning strikes to probes seeking to on it surface.

This is why reachers want to study this earth-like planet It has many features that others don't and maybe if one day they could find the answers there could actually be human life there.
