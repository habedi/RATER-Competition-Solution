Will this technology be of any value in the classroom? This technology seems cool and all but will it really help? If this technology can read facial expressions then it could be a good thing but this is why it would not help.

When you are in school do you ever feel bored? We all do sometimes that is just how things work. Now do you think that if our computers could tell if we were bored that it would make the lesson any more exciting. The lessons that we are taugh are mostly given to the teachers or the teachers make it. If our computers think that we are bored of the lesson it wants to change that. How does that happen? The teahcer would have to make more than one lesson to teach the class. There are also things that are just completely boring at school there can not be a way to make them any better.

Then there is also one or two good things about it like if it were able to detecte if someone were not feeling very good about themselves. They might need help but not come out and say it, this technology could help with that. If you put this in a school you would just get a lot of stressed out faces that have to much homework to do while still trying to have a life. But is this taking things to far is this a violation of peoples personal space. Sometimes people want to keep their emotions to themselves. If this technology is used in schools then there goes all privacy that we have.

This might be a good idea for advancement in technology, but is it the right thing to put in schools? This technology seems pretty cool it could be used in other places but should not be somewhere like a school. This would just be one more thing that makes school not a fun place to be in. There are some lines that do not need to be crossed and this is one of them.
