Dear Principal i agree on the policy 1 because it is better for student to have their phone out but if they have it during class then it wouldn't be right. Also if the principal let us have our own time to use our cell phone then student wouldn't have to argue about it because if we student can't have our own cell phone out then the teacher or staff shouldn't either because it wouldn't be unfair to some student who have cell phones cause they can't check their cell phones. If we have lunch time to use our cell phone then student would really be glad and thankful to the principal for letting us do this kind of stuff. Cell phones are a good help for us because cell phone can remind us if we have to do any home work or check online for anything that we cant find, and the computer/laptop would take a while to load up and start the program but our cell phones would be faster for us to look for some of the home work or school work that we couldn't find. If we turn off our phone during class and only use them for a certain amount of class period then it would be good for us student and what happens if our parents have an emergency for us and we didn't check our phone, sometimes it might be a big emergency for them to text or call us because what if someone in our family broke a bone or pass away, cell phone may be a big help if we need them. Also cell phone can be a help to check our phone or call our parents to remind us things we need and maybe our parents can remind us to bring home some books or some home work for our younger brother/sister to do when they are absent . Cell phone is a really big help but some teacher or staff thinks its just a distraction for other people because they might think different, and they might also though that the person is just using it to text or play with it for a while when the teacher is giving important information. As I write this letter this is my own personal idea about what I think should happen and just let it stay the same for a past couple years. Finally this is my letter to the principal about if you should allow the us student to use our cell phone during lunch time or etc and have it turn off when class start or when we go to class.
