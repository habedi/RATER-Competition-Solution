If everyone does one extracurricular activity then we wouldn't have after school activities like art club, homework club, and cooking club. People might think that they should chose witch extracurricular activity they could do and ,not one given to them by force. But some also might say that its great practice for the real world and, we should get used to it. Not only that we should also be prepared for extra work in some jobs but we also need to be more active. Why do we have to do one not by choice but rather by someone else.

Why do we go to after school classes because you might be struggling in classes or its a after school club. For the after school clubs we might need help with English or, help with math but the extra activities might make you struggle more from less time to do homework or study for tests. For instance when you have a sol you need to study and prepare for that but if you have a extracurricular activity you will have to do that first and then study it doesn't seem like a good way to prep students for a huge test. Not only that if they choose to add more time for these activities then it would be easy for after school clubs but students will hate it.

Adding more time to school will make most people unhappy and maybe even stressed out from too much work. Whenever more time is added to school it means more classes and usually its more than just one class being added its most likely two or three maybe more. When people find out there is more time in school they will try to change it to less time in school because people hate change. Not only that people hate more time they will not get more time for lunch and lunch is important if you dont have food then you will starve or you will be super sluggish. But also you have no choice for the activity you have been given to you.

You might be struggling in public speaking but you were given work with people in drama and try to go over the script for the next play. This is why there needs to be choice in the matter of activities you are apart in. Someone also might want a specific job but might have a skill that has no indicators that it can work with that job you want. So it's a draw from the hat situation basically and if your unlucky enough you will get something other than you wanted.

Everything comes down to what do you like not what the person that makes the rules thats their opinion and you dont have to like it. Adding more time just makes the days longer and tougher but one day everyone will get used to it. Not only do people have not being able to change things they don't like not making a difference they want to see their dreams come true but life isn't like that. Why dont we have a choice and we dislike these changes so why are they made?
