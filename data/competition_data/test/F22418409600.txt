Dear Principal,

I agree with your newest policy because of how low our student grades have become. Our students shouldn't be able to play in sports with such low grades. They could be focusing on their grades rather than playing sports by doing extra credit, studying, or even doing homework instead of practicing for the big game or any other sports event. Most of the students at this school could be doing extra credit instead of going to a game. They can easily ask all their teachers for this simple way to raise their grades. it may not be much but it may be the line between most getting to play a sport or even not passing at all! Most of our teachers give extra credit and most of the time it is substantial! This simple way is a easy grade raiser. These low grades could easily be raised by studying. All we have to do is do thirty minutes of studying and we could raise our grades and test scores instead of practicing for that game. Most teachers even make it so we don't have a game and a test at the same date. They even tell you what you must study in order to get the best test scores so we don't flunk the class. All students at our school could have good test scores and still be in a sport. Some of our students don't even do most of their homework! They could do their homework in as little as twenty minutes and then they have the rest of the day to do anything they want. if they don't understand the homework all they have to do, for most teachers, is ask questions or even schedule a lesson with them at lunch or even after school. Some of our teachers even let you correct your work and get the problem correct and yet some students don't take part in this opportunity for our grades to go up. All the students an our school could have good grades and participate in sports and yet most don't. Your new policy will get them in line and doing extra credit, studying, and doing all of their homework to stay on the team. Please create this policy for the sake of
