Phones and Driving

Cell phones, we all have them, and they have become a necessity of daily life. This innocuous invention is close to cars in how much we now rely on them. There isn't any problem with this, but, these two great inventions are known for being dangerous to use together, leading to death for many. While cars already have many things to distract oneself with, from stereo to air conditioning to seat adjustment, cell phones have been the only thing to get so much attention for distracting drivers. The question is whether drivers can safely use phones while driving, the usefulness of cell phones in cars, and who usually uses their phone while driving.

To start with, drivers can safely use phones in cars, with a few caveats. First off, eyes should be kept on the road, so if you can use a phone hands-free, more power to you. Obviously, this excludes things like texting or video chat from being used, but voice calls need no such limitation. Since voice calls aren't really much different from talking to somebody else in the car, except you don't ever swivel to look at them. Then there is GPS, which can be used, but the destination and settings should only be changed while stopped, so there is no danger to oneself or others. Ultimately phones are safe to use in cars, as long as you remain conscious of yourself and your surroundings.

Cell phones are useful for so many things, such as GPS, communication, or simple entertainment. You might carry out a meeting over the phone, or find the directions to a hole in the wall restaurant. Phones can also be used in emergency situations to notify others of your location. Phones definitely have a lot of use to someone in a car, and they are fine to use.

Normally young people are most credited with using phones while driving, and while this is technically true, some thought is necessary. While young people have grown up using technology, and are much more used to using their cell phones, they have also been inundated with messages about texting and driving throughout their childhood. A fairly common occurrence, however, is that people relax their caution while tired or otherwise influenced. Just by eliminating regular distracting situations, chances of crash reduce dramatically.

When the right precautions are put into place, such as not texting and only using GPS while stopped, using the phone while driving is not too dangerous. Ultimately, it becomes the individual responsibility of people to stay safe while driving.
