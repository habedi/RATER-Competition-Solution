If students are required to complete summer projects, than it should only be fair that their projects are student designed. Student's can be able to come up with better creative ideas and are far more likely to complete their assignments if there are such topics student's can be expressive with and even relate to as well. Teacher designed projects' are often based on what teachers believe students should be learning but what some teachers can seem to forget about is all the colorful ideas students can bring to life when they're given the chance to. constantly doing old routine projects causes students to not participate and fail; furthermore, giving students a chance to work their way can make a lot of students cooperate and finish their projects.

I believe that students can easily find so much to write about when they have free time and the opportunity to let it be done their way. They can do projects on where they traveled to and what they learned and seen, some troubles they might go through or even letting them go to the zoo and do a project on their favorite animal. While sometimes teacher designed projects can be fun like letting them read a fun book and completing a time line on it, showing their cultures, sharing their talents and more. Giving students textbook work and big packets will most likely get lost or students choose not to complete it. Providing students with great ideas and topics will guarantee more students to wanting to complete their assignments.

As a student myself, I can understand how students work better when they are given more manageable and exciting assignments. Students easily get so bombarded with unnecessary work when there is so much more to be learned and taught that can be useful in your life later on. We often do the work but sometimes can't follow the instructions or completely misunderstand what we are assigned to do.

In conclusion summer projects shouldn't always be based on what our tecaher or professor chooses to assign us to complete. Students should be able to come up with resposible and fun idea to complete for their summer projects without doing teacher designed tasks. While some assignments can be manageable for students some are just not what we would chose to complete over our summer break.
