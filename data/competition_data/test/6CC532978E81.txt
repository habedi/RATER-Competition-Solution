Dear Principal,

Community service takes time and lots of effort. Time many students don't have. Not only do we have loads of homework we also have family things to do when we get home. We have so much to do as it is adding more requirements will only add stress to both students and their parents.

Students are scrunched for time as it is and adding another thing to the to do list won't help. As a student I know how quickly a day flies by because of lack of time. I go home do my homework and then clean. After that I get ready for bed and then I relax and calm down. I do that by watching TV or going on the computer until nine o'clock, then it's off to bed. We wake up get ready for school and do the same thing all over again.

Plus, there are the students who play sports after school and they have to get homework done as well. We simply don't have time for much more than we already have.

When students are at home it is there time with family. Family is important for most students and some juggle so many different activities it wouldn't be right to make them juggle even more and then have them not be able to see their family as much. Students need a break to relax at some point. Family time is important to a child's development. If a child grows up without seeing their family they won't learn necessary morals and relationships. A family teaches a child almost all that they need to know when it comes to behavior and communicating with others. Family is very important.

If a student wanted extra credit maybe that could be offered to them for doing community service but it should not be mandatory. That would add stress to parents and students alike. Stress could cause a student to not sleep much, be angry or to develop habits like biting there nails. The same applies for the students parent's. If a student doesn't get much sleep how are they going to concentrate and get the grades they normally do. They might even fall asleep during school. They maybe more uptight than usual and lash out at other students. Any result of stress would not be good to the students' health, therefore you shouldn't add to their stress. It may harm the student and others around the student.

Sincerely,

A worried student
