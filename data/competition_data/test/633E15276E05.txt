Dear Principal, I think kids should do community service because it can really help the community and make it a lot safer for kids to play in and not have parents worrying about anything terrible happening to there kids. Also you can help younger kids to have a better education by going to there schools and teaching them how to make good decisions in life. Another reason is it will keep the kids out of trouble if they do community service and have them doing something productive. Lastly doing community service can help you get into a very good collage and then you can get a good job when your done with collage. Then you could be so good at that you can get a job at it and help out struggling community's all over the united states. Principal that is why i think kids should do some community service in any way to help kids the elderly or the community that you are living in.
