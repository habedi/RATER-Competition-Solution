Global warming is a huge concern, and most of the blame is on cars. In

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , and Elizebeth Rosenthal's

The End of Car Culture;

they explain everything happens in areas where they suspend car usage, regulate it, ban it and seeing trends of areas where they just do not care about cars. Limiting the use of vechicles can have a emormous benefitcal impact.

One reason for a minial car usage, is that people tend to get stressed with cars in order to do errands or go to work. Following with Rosenthal's article, she mentions a media trainer with two childern named Heidrun. The mother states "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." In Vauban, many people move there with having sold a car; that particular area has 30% of families using cars. Many people want to worry less about having to errands. It is much easier to have things closer to you instead of having to go far.  Continuing the essay with Selsky's article, in Bogota, Colombia; they have a car free day where everyone avoid using cars. Selsky quotes a businessman where he says " It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." In this particular day, he has a day to experience no stress and having the positive mind of knowing that this benefits the environment as well as himself. Therefore, limting the usage of cars relives stress even for a day.

Another reason is pollution, this is a huge problem around the world and many are trying to find solutions to less the effects of global warming. In Duffer's article, Paris takes a huge step in reliving their smog problem. They have banned cars, not exactly, they are regulating them by having odd number license plates go one day then evens on another. This limits the use of cars for people, in which later in the article it relieves the smog so they also relive the ban. But in other areas, people do not seem to have an interest in cars like America. Many of America's young people are not really interested in cars. Rosenthal explains how it would have many positive effects, " If the pattern persists- and many sociologists belive it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. Thus, having less people use cars can be a solution to pollution.

In conclusion, benefits to limiting cars use is less stress due to not having a car and lessing the effects of pollution. All this is a major impact leading into a better world.
