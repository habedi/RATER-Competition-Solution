The Creation of Recess

______________________________________________________________________________

Dear principal TEACHER_NAME,

I'm aware that you are attempting to improve the GPA of the students by taking away sports from those with a c grade average. Well you should know that won't work. Most of the kids don't even go for the sport. They just do it to hang out with one another to chat and gossip. They will just find other things to do, so they wont have to boost they're grades.

Plus most of the kids at this school don't even play sports. The students actually have jobs and chores to do. Others are occupied by things outside of school, that don't necessarily have to be good things. they could start doing things with one another that were trying to prevent.

Principle TEACHER_NAME haven't you heard you will attract more bees with honey than vinegar? Instead of taking something away why don't you offer ? Maybe you could offer them time to like I said previously, chat and gossip. I would work harder for goof off time than sports. Instead of retain, why not recess?

your friend,

STUDENT_NAME
