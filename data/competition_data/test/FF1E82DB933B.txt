Many students participate in extracurricular activities. Students participate in these activities because they want to have fun with their friends, study with their peers and meet up with people who share the same interests as them. This is done by many of the student's own choice, and they can decide the pace of their learning. This also should be a choice of students instead of being required by the school. Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because forcing a student to take an activity causes them to lose interest, students already have large quantities of homework and studying to deal with and many students don't have a method of transportation to go to or get home from extracurricular activities.

Students should not be forced to take extracurricular activities because it causes them to lose interest in them. When students are given a willing choice to take activities, many of them choose to do it. For example, many kids will try out for their school's football team or Debate Club. They can decide the pace they want to do it and they can decide if they need to stop to focus on something else. When a student is forced to take an extracurricular, they might lose interest in the activity because they are being forced to take it. For example, if a marching band student does not want to participate in a club this year to focus on schoolwork, forcing them to take an activity could hurt them negatively mentally and academically. Students should be allowed to decide if they want to participate instead of the school so they keep their interest in the topic.

Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because they already have large quantities of homework and studying to deal with. Many students take high level courses, including IB or AP courses. These courses hand out many hours of homework each day. If a student is forced to take an extracurricular course while working on hard classes, they will arrive home late and not be able to finish their homework. These courses also require large amounts of studying to pass. Many students spend hours and hours studying for tests and might not have time for an extracurricular activity. They are better off taking no extracurricular activity so they can pass their hard courses. Schools should not force students to take extracurricular courses so they can deal with homework and studying.

Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because many students don't have a method of transportation to go to or get home from extracurricular activities. Many students who come from school get home through bus because they live too far away to walk or their parents cannot come pick them up. Many schools around the world do not have an option of after school buses. Many extracurricular activities, like football, require students to meet up at fields miles away from their school. This makes it a problem for students to get to extracurricular activities. If an after school activity is held in school, problems will still arise. If an after school bus is not provided, students will be forced to walk or get a ride from their parents. This is a problem for many parents as they work far away and don't have the time necessary to drop off their kids. Students should not be forced to take extracurricular activities because they do not have a method of transportation to go to or get home from these activities.

In conclusion, students should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity because of interest loss, quantity of homework and studying and lack of transportation. Many students already take extracurricular activities without being forced, like Football Club, Debate Club or Science Club. Forcing an activity would cause them to lose interest. Students also get high quantities of homework, as many students take high level classes that require hours be spent studying and doing homework on them. Many students also don't have a mean of transportation to get to a certain place for their club or to go home from the club, which would cause problems for working parents. Extracurricular activities are meant as options for students if they want to participate in something they enjoy and they should remain optional.Â
