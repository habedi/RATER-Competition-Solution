When looking at the face it look baerly looks like a face, it could be literally anything just for the fact on how unfocsed and brod the shape is. When looking at a face you see all the details and diffrences but in this picture its just three smuges in the shape of two eys and a mouth. Also when looking at the photo you cant really see how large it is but its way to big to be the size of a face, its more the size of a building or larger. You can see its a rectangle shape that appers to be some sort of hill natrully created by the enviorment so saying it looks like a face is really dumb because if you saw a really blured picture of a rock with dirt in the formation of eyes and a mouth, would you call it a face?
