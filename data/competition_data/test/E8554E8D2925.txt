I agree with this change. I think that our principle should change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Think about it, if you were a parent would you really want your child paying more attention to his or her sport than focusing on his or her education? i sure would not.

If the principle changes the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average the students will try their hardest to get their grades up if they want to get into a sport or other activity. Now if the principle doesn't change this the students would not care for their grades as much, especially if they are an athlete.

They would just be waiting for the bell to ring so they can go play more sports.

The principle should also change this school policy because if she does this the students will be learning more. Instead of playing any sport or other activity they can be at home, library, or any other place studying. Focusing on their school work.

Furthermore, the principle should change this school policy because the students will actually be getting their homework done. I am sure that if this C average school policy stays the same, most students will not be doing their homework, but if you change this their is a better chance of them doing this. Why you ask? well because most students will go home, drop their book bag on the floor and run out of their house again just to catch their practice for the sport they play. if this changes their would be a better chance for them to do their homework because if their not playing their sport, they will take the time to do their work.

Now, don't you think that the principle should consider changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average? The principle doing this will have so many positives. For some doing this will influence their grades and the students will do their hardest to get their grades up. Also, students will study more. and lastly students will get their homework done. Now doesn't that sound great?
