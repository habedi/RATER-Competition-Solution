Children shouldn't have to at least have a B average just to play a sport. That's like bringing kids down. They shouldn't mind grades because kids wont be able to be active, cant make new friends, make them want to just go home and watch tv.

To start with, kids wont be able to be active. They only want to do a sport because they can have fun and loose weight for free. Sports are something kids should be able to enjoy at school no matter what. And because you wont let them play they will be very upset. Being upset will lead them to eat more play less. Adults always want us to be active might as well let us be good grades or not.

Continuing, they wont make any new friends. They wont have anybody to be there for them. Some kids don't know how to make friends but if the play a sport they will be comfortable with themselves and have more confidence. Some kids who have bad grades probably don't have anyone there for them, maybe if the play a sport they could find a friend that could be there for them. All because you let them play a sport their grades could get better.

Lastly, not letting them play will result them going home watching tv. The television rots kids brains and that's not going to do their grades any good. If only they could play a sport and get all ready and active their grades will sky rocket. The television has cartoons and all that bad stuff. If they were playing a sport they would be enjoying life and not laying on the couch.

So if the kids can play they would be in good moods. Letting kids play will get them active, get them new friends, and they wont want to watch tv that much. All because they played a sport.
