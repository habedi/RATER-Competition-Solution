What if you went to school without actually stepping foot in the building? It is reasonable to assume that your life path would have been much different. Some schools are offering a way for students to attend classes virtually by video conferencing. In theory, this may seem like a good idea, but it could end up causing more harm than good. Giving students a way to attend school online is not a good idea because students need to be able to socialize with others to grow, and it would be too difficult to manage.

A vital part of growing up is socializing with others and making friends. School is a great medium for children to socialize and interact. Not being at school in person will give students the opportunity to avoid human interaction all together. People underestimate the importance of social contact at a young age. When I would miss school, I would mainly miss being able to spend time with my friends. By allowing students to attend classes from home, it takes away the chances to truly bond with others.

An important aspect of this decision are the difficulties with managing it.

How exactly would you determine who is allowed to use this and who isn't? How would students move from class to class?

It would create extra hassle for teachers to set the students computers up every class. Students would also have the ability to leave class without any repercussions. There are way too many problems with this idea for it to be considered viable.

Some people believe that students would be more inclined to do work given this freedom. This is completely false. It would be impossible for teachers to tell if students were paying attention or playing games. With no way of keeping kids on task, they have free reign to do whatever they want. Giving students a way to take advantage of the system is never a good idea.

In conclusion, it is a bad idea to give students the option to attend class from home because it is too difficult to maintain and it takes away in person contact. Most students would love this idea because they dislike school. What they don't realize is that with this idea, they would miss out on valuable time spent with their friends. This would cause an influx of adults who have trouble talking with others. In the end, this would waste both the schools money and the schools time.Â
