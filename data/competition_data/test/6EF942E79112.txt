Dear Principle

Every student have to participate in a after school activity. i don't agree with this decision. Because everyone does not have the money or the time and grades for that. Also it would be harder on coaches if a lot of people try out for the team because he is cutting a lot of people from the team. Then parents are going to be mad because there son or daughter is going to get a bad grades just because they didn't do a after school activity. i disagree because people dont have time or money or don't have the grades foe the activity.

People barely get free lunch how are they going to pay for trips and a hotel rooms if they have to go places for that after school activity. Also how are they going to find time to do homework. kids need free time to so they can live there lives will they still got it. Also there might not be a sport or activity the kids like cause the club or the sport might go till the school year is over and don't want to be stuck doing something you don't like. Also that's disrespect full if you force someone to do a after school activity.

Parents might not like having to pick there kid up everyday after school. Parents also might not like there kids being stressed over school work. Kids all ready have to stay at school for 7hours a day if they stay after its like 9 hours a day. Also as you get older you get tired easier so them 8th grade kids are going the go to sleep when they get home and forget about there homework and they might not even eat. I think parents would like to see there kids at the dinner tables and not sleep all day.

Now let me tell you how this all adds up. First you have to find a activity then you get cut from sports and you cant find the right club. Then you finally find a club but turns out you dont like the club and you have to do it all year. Then you come home all stressed out because you dont like the club and have a lot of work to do and you tired. So then you get to sleepy so you take a nap but you sleep to long now you didnt finish the homework that you were going to turn in the next day. Now you have a bad grade and your mom is on your case about your work now your even more stressed. Then you quit the club because you so stressed out. Now when sols come you have a NHI in the grade book cause you didn't do the club.
