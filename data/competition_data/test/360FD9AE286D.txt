In the Article is says that "The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too." this shows how it can makes animated faces have more expressions such in Video games, Video surgeries, and classroom lesson.

This essay shows how the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can be useful in a classroom and to better the future of our students and schools.
