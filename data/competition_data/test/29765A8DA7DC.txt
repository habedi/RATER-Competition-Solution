Dear principal

You should allow students to brings cell phones to school because you never know what could happened to them. Because something could happened to them or to someone else after school and there's no way to contact for help. And so like if there ride ain't coming after school they could call them to let them know.

Another reason why they should bring their phones to school is so they could have there own time like during lunch. Because during lunch is when they get to talk so why just not let them use their phone. And so they could know about everything and no be in class looking through their phones trying to know what's going on. and like if the teacher gives them free time that will be a good time to let them check their phones. And let them use them before school like in breakfast. And if they get caught using it during class they should get a warning next time.
