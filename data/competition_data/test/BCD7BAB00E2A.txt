Disgusting pollution in the air! Terrible, but also deadly for our atmosphere, animals, and of course ourselves. As seen in paragraph 17, car emmisions arn't only destroying our enviroment, but are also polluting our air to the point where Paris was covered for days in complete smog. That is why biking, walking, running, conservative driving, etc are very needed in these days where everyone belives gas powered vehicles are our way of life. While people drive in cars constantly it creates more carbon emmisions destroying our air and environment, but on the other hand more biking causes less traffic build up, healthier, and more businesses open up in walking distance because of the magnitude of participants walking/biking.

To begin with, driving in cars isnt only extremely dangerous, it pollutes the air we all breathe! It makes our lungs become more weak and suseptible to disease and sickness. People may argue that giving up our most widely used transportation vehicle in the U.S. and very profitable vehicle industries, is too much. But I argue, that giving up something that will later in time completely destroy us and our earth is worth it. Pollution is a very serious problem that most people can't seeem to wrap their head around. It's a deadly chemicals and waste being put into our air we breathe every second, yet we chose our vehicles over our precious air?!

Next, understanding what more walking and less vehicular trnsportation can do for the world has amazing effects. Not only is it a healthy alternative to walk instead of driving because of our obseity issue here in America, but it cuts out pollution which hurts us and animals. More walking will create less traffic and more businesses and restaruants in walking distance, causing a better community and economy.

In conclusion, more walking and biking is a much better alternative to driving cars constantly. Communities come together more, less traffic, more safety, no road rage, etc. These are all things that could come from walking instead of driving in vehicles.
