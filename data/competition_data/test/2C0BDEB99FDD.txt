In America, the summer break is the longest break students will have. It is usually three months, June, July, and August. In this time frame, most students do not keep with with outside, extracurricular class so, it is a period of no learning. As a result, students forget most of what they have learned in the previous years. A direct effect is some schools requiring students to complete summer projects. A question arises if these summer projects should be either teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, it allows for freedom, allows for creativity, and the student is more likely to place more effort.

Summer projects should be student based because it allows for more freedom. When a project is assigned by a teacher, a student may not put the effort they are capable of because the project bores the student. To solve this, the projects should be determined by the student. This allows for more freedom to choose and the student has an urge to complete because they had chose it. This may also take off a burden for the teacher, who has to develop a project for the class. If a students has the freedom to chose their project, they will be more likely to complete it.

Student-designed summer projects allows for creativity. Students are allowed to chose their projects on whatever they like. Whether it be math, science, english, history, or any other subject the student is interested in. As a result of this, the students are allowed to direct the project in whichever way they wish. This direction will make the student more interested in their project, as it is one of their interests. When students are interested in a certain topic, they will be more likely to complete it faster and put more effort into it. Student-designed projects will have more effort placed into it.

Lastly, if summer projects are student-designed, the student will be more likely to place more effort. Alongside grades, this gives the student an added incentive. If students design their own project, since it will be their interest, they will be more likely to complete. There are several students who place minimal effort, or no effort at all in projects, especially if the topic does not interest them. This can be solved if the project were student-designed. Summer projects, in which were designed by the students, will have a higher chance of being completed and having more effort placed into them.

Critics may argue, saying students will abuse this and make the project as simple as possible. Although this may happen, it is the teacher's job to provide guidelines on the project. Such as how many slides, if it is a presentation, or words, if it is an essay, or minutes, if it is a speech. The teachers will be in control of the format of the project. This disallows the student to simplify the project.

To conclude, schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed, because it allows for freedom, allows for creativity, and there is more effort in the project.Â
