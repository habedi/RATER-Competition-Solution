I agree with the principal because students can spend they time doing something. In this days kids play with technology and don't pay attention to the imporant things. That's why they should be in a activity that the school is offering.

To being with, they can spend time with there friends and they can even make new friends. Other thing is they are having fun and not worried about school and tests. However, some students don't like doing does types of activity because they are shy or maybe they don't like to socialism with other people or do sports but the point is having fun and meet others students. For example, if you are alone or you want to know new people in the activity you can find new friends or you just go and sign in with a friend.

Futhermore, having activity in school is kinda having free time because sometimes you get field trips. Other thing is you can share you idea to the people and they will understand you. That why teachers put the activitys to us. However, there are some students that do not like to talk or do sports but at least we are having fun. For example, having like a type of activity in school it's like having a break to school, work, test, because you are something that you like.

In conclusion, having activity in school it's more fun and we can make others students to like sports and don't be afraid to talk.
