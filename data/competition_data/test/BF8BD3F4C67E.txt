Many schools require students to complete summer projects in order to keep them learning over the break. These projects are usually teacher-designed and are assigned to the students at the end of the year. Some students argue that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed since it is taking up their summer fun time, but many disagree. Summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed because students will receive a premade rubric, projects are likely to be more organized, and projects can still be based off the students liking.

Some will argue that summer projects should be student-designed due to the fact that it is taking place during the students summer free time. Students want to be able to create the project themselves so then they can create it how they want to create it but that makes grading very difficult for teachers. Letting students design summer projects also has a high risk of unorganitzation because students may have the mentality that they can do whatever they want and still receive a good grade. If students do what their teachers tell them to do, then they will already know what to do from the beginning.

Most teachers and parents would agree that a rubric should be given to the students for them to follow while completing projects. Rubrics allow students to have a guideline to follow while completing their projects, essentially making the projects easier. Rubrics also give students a checklist that helps them stay on track and makes sure they are getting everything done that they need to get done in order to get a good grade. If students created their own rubrics, that would make grading projects extremely difficult for the teachers and most students do not understand how hard it is to actually create a rubric. Therefor, rubrics should always be given out by the teachers.

If summer projects continue to be teacher-designed, then students are more likely to be more organized with their project. Students will have gotten an explanation on how to complete their project and will have been informed in a way everyone understands on how to complete the project to the best of their abilities. Organization is key when completing projects and the best way to stay organized is to allow the teachers send students on the right track. Most students to not think about how easy it is to become unorganized and turn a great project into a ball of confusion. They need the teachers help to make sure they do the project right.

Summer projects may be teacher-designed but that does not mean they can not be based off of the students opinions and liking. Students can still receive a rubric and be told what to do and still have a high level of creativity involved in their project. Before school comes to an end, teachers can ask the students what they want to do most. having that information allows teachers to create a project that is easy for them to grade and is still fun and enjoyable for the students who are doing the project. A big factor in school projects is making something that the students can be happy and proud of and not something that they forced themselves to finish and are unhappy with. In order to keep both teachers and students happy, summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed.

Once summer starts, students become independent and are on their own with the project they are assigned with. That is why they should be given a guideline on how to complete their project, ways to stay organized, but they should still be able to complete their project with a smile on their faces. If summer projects stay teacher-based, then all three points can be addressed and improved upon. Students may believe that they can do everything by themselves but they will never succeed without a teachers help from the beginning.
