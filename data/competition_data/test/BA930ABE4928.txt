Online school has become more and more popular in the past years, which is possible today due to the evolving technology. Teachers upload the material and video chat with the students to teach, and the students submit their finished work for the teacher to grade. This seems like a great way for students to learn at their own speed and to attend school even though you might not have a way to get to school.

Every student has their own learning speed and way that they learn best. I usually understand things pretty fast and do not have a lot of trouble learning at a fast pace, many other students need more time to understand a topic and more explanation. When in a class room there is only a limited amount of time to ask questions or for the teacher to explain again. Every student also has their preferred way of learning. Some keep most information when they write it down over and over again, some are more visual and need graphs or pictures, and others have to try ore build things to learn. This amount of individuality is often not possible if you are in a class room with twenty-five other students.

When I was in eight grade we learned about Australia in English class, and how the kids who live in he middle of the outback use online school and video chatting to do their school work. Australia is not the only place where that would be handy; students here in the US live very rural sometimes too and take a very long time to get to school. If they could do their school work online they would not have to go through the trouble and could to their work from home. This would also come in handy if you have a severe illness or injury and it is impossible for you to attend school for an extended amount of time. The student could do their homework from home or a hospital and not miss months of classes and possibly have to redo the entire year.

However this is not a fit for everyone. Some need more help and assistance that can not be provided through a screen but has to be done in person. I like having the opportunity to talk to my classmates about the topic or ask questions directly to the teacher. I find it easier to understand, especially difficult topics, when they are explained to me face-to-face.

Online school may not be something for everybody and I believe that everyone should decide for themselves personally if this would be something for them. I prefer going to school and learning in a class room because I get easily distracted and would not actually learn anything if I was at home. Today, it is almost impossible to not use any kind of media and technology in your day to day life and it makes learning a lot easier. We have to find a middle point between not using at all and too much.
