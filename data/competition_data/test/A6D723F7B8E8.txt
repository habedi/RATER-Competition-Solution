Dear, School Principal

I believe that students should have the first policy. Students should only use their cell phones during their free time. During class they should be turned off so that they won't distract other students. We should have cell phones at school because if after school the buss left or an emergency and no one is around well you have your cell phone and you could call your parents. Some people think that's wrong to have a cell phone at school but we think it's okay. If you don't use it during class that's okay. Some students use their phones during class. If students just would use their cell phones and other distractive things only during lunch or in their free time it would be less distractive to everybody. Another reason why we should have cell phones at school it could be because what if your mom or dad ain't home and after school you don't know where to go or what to do. That's a reason why some people take their cell phones to school. Not everybody takes cell phones to school. Some parents think taking a phone to school is wrong. But we give the same reasons why we have cell phones to them. I hope you change your mind and you can give us a privilege to have are cell phones in school but not use them during class time. If you see someone using their cell phones during class time you should take them away and don't give that person any other privilege. Thank you for giving up your time and reading my letter.

Sincerely,
