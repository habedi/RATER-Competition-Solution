Dear, Principal

I am writing to you on behalf of your decision on requiring community service for all students. I think community service is a great experience for all people. Although, I don't think it should be required. When something is required to do something it feels like somewhat of a chore. Also, when you are doing community service you are doing it to help people or the environment not just to build up a grade in class. You simply can not make some one do community service. There are ways for you to get more people into doing community without forcing them. For example, a lot of people want to help the community but they have a hard time finding services to work on. So what you can do is set up a bulletin board up in the school that displays all of the possible opportunities. I would also advise you not to reward the students who do community service because, again community service is not about rewards but, giving out to the community. Please take these words into consideration.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
