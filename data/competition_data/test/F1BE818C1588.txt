Have you ever wanted to see other things in space like our "sister plant" Venus? In this article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author was supportinhg his ideas of why we should go and explore Venus our "sister plant." The author explaied why he thought exploring Venus was a good idea and why we should keep looking into it. In this article the author does support his ideas in exploring Venus. Scientists are finding new ways to vist and test Venus surface, scientist are talking about what Venus has to offer, and Venus is so much like Earth.

First, Scientists are trying to find new ways of testing and even visting Venus. There have been a couple of approaches on studying Venus. NASA has been working on this "simplified electronics" that are made up of "silicon carbide." NASA even tested it in a "chamber simulating the chaod of Venus's surface" (the challenge of exploring venus 7). The simplified electrons had lasted up to three weeks in the simulation.

Secondly, Venus is just like Earth. A very long time ago venuse was covered largely with oceans and some scientist think that Venus was able to support diffrent various of life forms, and still today Venus has some features that are "analogous" to those on earth.

In concluison Venuse needs to be explored becasue it has some of the charticsts that Earth has and it will help us expand more and have us venture out further more in or solar sytem and more.
