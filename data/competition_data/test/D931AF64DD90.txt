Is the face on mars a natural landform? I see that the face is just a natural landform. The face is just a natural landform to some others think its artificial. There are many reasons why it is just natural.

In 1976 a photo that was taken on mars was perceived as a face. Since it was 1976 the photo wasnt that great, but then again in 1998 and 2001 more photos were taken and they showed that it didnt resemble a face anymore due to better cameras. From the pictures in the article it looked like a face at first but then the next pictures add a bit more detail and removed some of the shadows, thus it did not look like a face. NASA also put in the caption of the image " huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." ,this means it was just an illusion given by shadows. NASA also showed the people just to bring attention to mars and they have scientific research on the face being natural.

In conclusion the face is just a natural lanform. when you compare the photos you can see the difference in shape and detail. Some research in the article states the picture shows a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American west. Scientist state all it really is is a martian mesa.
