Can you imagine being forced to do something that you absolutely hate, well that's what my principal is doing to every student at my school. He's making it a requirement for all students to participate in sports or to work on the yearbook or student council. The students have no other option though, because even though its no fair at all , the teachers and staff dont care what we have to say. So I'm going to change that, but I'll need a little support.

I have to inform the principal what a bad decision this is for the health of all the students attending my school.

If all students were required to participate in a extracurricular activities that they don't want to, then it could lead to depression or suicide. Students have a lot of stress and pressure as it is as a student already, but imagine the students with even more, and that could lead to an increase of the amount of kids with depression and suicides. Some kids might not even be good at the sport they sign up for and and get bullied from the kids who are better at the sport and have more experience than them, and they feel pressured to do better and feel scared to make a mistake.

Therefore kids might feel like they arent good enough and give up, and everyone will think of them as the "quitter".

That can cause the kid to feel ashamed and as if he let everyone down on the team and most importantly himself.

Also there would be an increase of injuries if more students were participating in sports. There will most likely be more concussions occurring in the school year due to the danger of sports, and that would be sad if a student was seriously hurt and damage their body and have to live with an injury they got from doing something they really didn't want to even do initially. With all these new teams being made, there is going to be more little friend groups that wont be accepting to all the others. They wont except the fact that people might have interest in something other than what they are interested in and that all the friend groups are equal and that all sports matter equally. When it comes to sports most children become very competitive and feel like they always have to win everything, which is good when it comes to playing the sports with confidence but can get very annoying at school when they act like they are better than all the other students and become bullies to others. These extracurricular activities could also affect the health of the students by them getting overly stressed, over exercising, head injuries , and causing them not to be mentally healthy.

Most students barely get a chance to spend time with their family because of school, and most parents only send their kids to school to get an education but they dont send them there to play sports because that should be the kids decision if they want to participate in something or not. Plus we only have one childhood, so why would we waste it spending time and lots of effort to a extra curricular, that we dont enjoy and is no good for us or for our health, when

I could be at home cooking and baking at home in my lovely kitchen with my beloved family and one day remember as a good memory. Rather than me having a bad memory of a evil principal who forced all the students to participate in a extra curricular that they never wanted to .

The principal should just consider his decision again and think about all of this information and possible effects that can be caused by this decision. Also if he decides to go through with his decision then he should be prepared for the parents who dont agree with the new decision he has applied throughout the school and the angry kids who have injuries and who are mentally unhappy. Some parents might be so unhappy they might transfer their children to other schools.

The school might suffer financially because they would have to buy new things for each sports and uniforms for the students to wear. They would also have to support all the activies by paying for their parties and fieldtrips they go on and also the events they go on that cost alot of money to attend. So this decision ould effect the schools future and he has to keep in mind that we only get one life so why spend our time and effort on something that we are getting forced to do.
