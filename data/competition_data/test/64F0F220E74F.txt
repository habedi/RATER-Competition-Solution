Hello, if you have goten this, then please continue to read this. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because one, you get to help animals get to a safe place, two you get to travel over seas, and three you could have some fun here and there.

Through the time I've been here I've already helpped many animals get to the place they need to be at. Since I helpped out my aunt Katie on her farm it was easy to help the animals on bord. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys program I could help you with anything you need, that involes the animals. If this is the only reason why you're sighning up, then you're in for more than what you expected.

Travel over seas and vist many places that include Itly, China, and many more. Even if you almost go over bord it's still worth being on the boat, unless you grew up around baots and can stay on bord if it's a bad storm. It's hard being a Seagoing Cowboy believe me I know, but it can be fun no matter what happens.

You can have fun with the others when we are on return trips we can play many sports that we want, since we don't have the animals. Even if we have the animals we can find somethings that are fun on the boat. To me it's fun already with or without the animals, because there are always people by your side, and you never get lonely.

If you do join there will be plenty of fun things to do I can't count them all, but I'm sure you can find something to do.

I hope you do end up joining very soon I can't wait to see all the new faces on bord. Even though there are plenty thing to do, it can still get very boring here. I can't wait to see all of you being part of the Seagoing Cowboys.
