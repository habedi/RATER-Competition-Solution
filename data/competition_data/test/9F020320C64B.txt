Dear Principal,

I know that you're considering to let us students use cell phones during free time, and lunch. In my opinion that is a great idea. I think it's a great idea, because it gives the students what they want in some ways and it helps parents too. Sometimes parents have to contact their children, because maybe they have to walk home or have something very important to do. This would give parents time to contact their children so they can give them that information. I think its also a good idea that once they get to class they have to turn off their phones. Turning off their phones is good because then students can't complain how they can't use their phones during school. Which would be a lie if they said that. It would be a lie because they can use their phones during school, just not in class. They should be turned off in class because we students have to learn. We won't learn if we keep texting in class, because then our grades would start dropping, and parents wouldn't be happy about that. We students have to have our phones, our phones are our life technically. Being able to use them partly during school would make us a lot happier. It wouldn't let us fully use our phones during school, but atleat we do a little bit. Students and even me wouldn't complain about turning them off in class, atleast i know i wouldn't. Also if you just ban phones entirely from the school then students are going to use their phones during class, and as i mentioned before, that wouldn't be good. Letting students use their phones sometimes would be better then never letting them use their phones because then they will sneak around with them. I just wanted to let you know what i thought about that choice, and i hope you take this letter into consideration.

Sincerely,
