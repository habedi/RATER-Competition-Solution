Student's should not benefit from attending classes at home because learning at home can be more of a distraction than school. First, students would most likely lose focus of their assignment and tend to other unimportant things. For an example: My teacher sends homework online for us to do while we'll home; a majority of our classmates do not finish their work because of their lack of their attention span.

Second, attending classes at home will cause you to stall because you don't want to do it. Example: A project was due in two days and I had not started on it yet, the cause of it was I kept telling my self I was going to do it later cause I wanted to do other stuff. A lot of students aren't responsible when it comes to picking and choosing what is important and what is not.

Finally, parents or siblings can distract you from completing your work by needing you for something or messing you up on your work. School has less distraction because it's more of a controlled environment and more of a disciplined place.
