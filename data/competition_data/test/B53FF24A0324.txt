Have you ever wanted to go around the world. Or maybe do something that not everyone gets a opportunity in there life to do. Become a Seagoing cowboy and help others in need. Seagoing cow boys are pepole that go on ships with animals such as horses,mules,and young cows that were shiped over seas because of war.

One of the reasons that you should become a seagoing cowboy is becasue when do you ever get a chance to go all around the world for free? As you aborad the ship there are some resposibiltes such as feding and watering animals,and pulling up bales of hay and bags of oats from the holds. Because of war the animals have to be shipped to many places like China,Italy,and Greece. Sence your on the boat with the animals you also get to vist these wonderful places. Its like a opportunity in a life time.

On the way back you may think there well just be a whole bunch of vacant spaces full of hay. You also may think a vacant area is usless,and boring without animlas living in it. But this is not the case. On the return we fill in the vacant spaces with fun activites such as volleyball ,baseball ,boxing ,tabeltennis, reading,and Whitting. So this makes the way back as much as fun as it is on the way there.

Take seagoing cowboy Luke Bomberger for example. As he gradutaed high school his whole life changed when his fellow friend Don Reiest asked him to join the UNRRA.The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation. Of cource Luke said yes becasue it was a opportunity of a life time. How could he have said no? He got to vist famous places like the Acroplis in Greece. And on his way to Chona he got to vist the Panama Canal.

These are the reasons of becoming a seagoing cowboy. If you are asked you should go you would like it. Traveling the world and you would not only be helping pepole,but helping animals. Take the opportunity be a seagoing cowboy.
