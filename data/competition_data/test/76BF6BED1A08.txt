I disagree with my principal on the topic of extracurricular activities. They should be a choice if someone wants to join in on these activities, not forced onto the students. People also have other things to do in their life such as Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, homework, tutoring,and dealing with family matters. Its important for kids to do things outside of their school because they get to learn about the world around them and the things they have right in the palm of their hands.

If you say "You have to do this" to a kid . They arent going to want to do it. It would seem like a chore to them and not many people like doing chores. But if you say "You would benefit from this and it will help you in your journey in life" the teenager may want to do it. Its like forcing a baby to walk; they will do it at their pace, yes you may have to help them at first but if you demand that they walk they wont even try. Kids just want to have fun and enjoy life before its too late and forcing us to do stuff is not going to help us live our lives. If someone wants to join the student council thats great! But if you force someone to do it they many not see their gift in politics because they did not enjoy it when they were a kid.

People also could have a lot going on in their lives. They may have just had a death in their family or a medical issue come up. You never know so they may not have time to do extra stuff and if your forcing them to do it, it could potently become an issue for the student. There are so many different things that could be going on it would take me a long time to list them all. So by forcing this on them you could mess with something you dont need to mess with and that could turn into something really bad.

So by making kids join a club or student council you could do a lot of damage you didnt intend to cause to students and their families. Kids should not be forced to do anything they dont want to do because it could stop them from liking something that could have made them successful. I think the principle should rethink his new rule and reverse the it for the sake of the students.
