Dear Principal,

Kids today are playing sports because they want to have fun and maybe even loose some weight. Many of these kids must maintain a C average in order to play the sport in which they are participating. However you are trying to make it a requirement to have a B average in order to play sports. This is wrong and unfair to kids who play sports and can only maintain C average.

You ask these kids to earn an B average, which means above average, and yet they can only earn a C average. If a student earns an C average that means they are still passing their classes and are an average student. Now I know you may say that a student should try to be better than average and study a little harder in order to earn B average and to play sports. However some kids study every day as best as they can and still earn a C average which is passing. These kids should not be forced to be above average if they are only average.

Kids today play sports sometimes in order to loose weight. If these kids earn a C average and cannot play the sport they want to play then they will become obeast. You can disagree with this statement because you can say they can exercise on their own time. In reality though, these kids only want to loose the weight by playing a sport because they have fun doing it and remember some of them can only earn C average.

Thank you for taking your time to read my letter and please make it so that kids have to earn C average to play sports.
