I think that this image of this face is very neat. Although I think that the face is real, but I dont think that the aliens did it though. I think that it was just nature made. Just like how if we are outside sometimes in the woods or just out in the yard you see like a heart shape or any shape on and object. You think its really neat and all but it doesnt go through your head that a strange living person made it. I know that it is on a diferant planet, and that we are looking for life some where else, but personaly I do not think that it is made by aliens.

Just because they think that there is some other life out there doesnt mean that that life made this. If there was other life out there they would have been able to see the life moving around. Like us in the city or something we have monuments and statutes and they are all in or very close to the city. We dont just build somethng and have it we out where no one will go. There all in the city. So dont you think that the aliens would be out around admireing it, and looking at it.

This is what I think.
