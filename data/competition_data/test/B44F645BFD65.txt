Why We Shouldn't Use FACS Technology in Classroom

FACS technology shouldn't be used in classrooms, and there are several good reasons as to why. Some of the things that people value the most are their money, a good education, and privacy. Implementing FACS technology can disrupt all of these things that people value.

First of all, the author of this article, Nick D'Alto, never even mentions the cost of this technology. Seeing as this technology isn't even fully developed yet, it would presumably cost millions of dollars in research to even get a fully developed working product. When new technology comes out, it is usually more expensive then anything else on the market. A school is the last place that should be using its resources for an emotion reading system. Most schools are lacking funding and resources, which is leading to cuts in many music and athletic departments. Another pretty well known fact is that schools spend less money on cafeteria food then JAILS do. If a school is getting additonal funding these are the types of things that they should be spending it on, not useless emotion readers.

This goes into the second reason, which is effectiveness and practicality. How do we know that what this computer is saying is actually correct. Sometimes, there are some things that advanced technology just cannot solve. A computer may sense a sad or confused look on a student's face, but that doesn't necessarily tell you WHY they are sad or confused. Dr. Huang from the article says that based off of the look on your face, the computer could modify the lesson. First of all, if a teacher is teaching a lesson, it probably wouldn't want a computer modifying what he or she wants to do. A teacher shouldn't modify the whole lesson for the entire class, just because someone has a certain look on their face, for reasons that may not even be school related. Modifying a lesson for students who aren't even struggling could potentiall ruin the way they learn, and how quickly and effectively they learn and understand concepts. If a teacher senses that a certain student is confused or not paying attention, they could always talk to them after class and fix the problem, which is a much more effecient and effective way of doing it.

A third reason that this FACS technology shouldn't be implented is for privacy. While the author does list some useful applications for this technology, such as surgeries and video games, common computers for everday use is not where it should be used. One reason that people fear this advanced technology in their own computers is for privacy. Many students probably don't want a camera in their school laptops constantly scanning their faces to see what kind of emotions they have. Many students would see that as creepy and intrusive, and would probably complain to the adminstration to remove it.

People value many things in life, but some of the most important are their money, a good education, and and their privacy. Having this FACS technology in schools can ruin all of these things, which is why using this technology in a classroom is not valuable.
