Community service. A benefit of students or a benefit for the school-board and government? Opinions may differ on making community service mandatory. However, in my opinion I believe when a student is credited with schools by serving for his or her community it is something that should be mandatory. This is because I believe, it will open doors for students who need a better image to the school of their choice, it can help their community be a better place for them, and others, and last, I believe it gives a chance for a student to organize their time and make their time better planned if not already planned. Although my belief is that, yes indeed it should be mandatory, at the same time I believe it cannot place a student in a type of lock from a personal life.

The opportunities for helping others is endless. School that look at community service hours can look at a student that has contributed to helping their community and see a student with a good image to helping their community. For example, a school that may require a student to have a certain amount of hours of community service can allow a student to have that requirement addressed because the community service was mandatory anyways. A student can have a good image to applying to a school and will have a good deed done to their community.

Helping a community although seeming dull or as an unrewarding task can help a student or person make a better place for which they live in. A student can be helping the place they live in become a better place. They can, in an example, show others that planting trees or cleaning litter can make their community a better place to live in and look at. Helping a community that one resides in can make a person happier about living in that place and happy about the idea that they have contributed to their community. It can also help a person's course in life.

A person can organize their time better when they are put in a situation that can change their life style. For example, with the mandate of community hours being served a person can be self educated on how to organize their time better. When a person has nothing to do at all they may give that time to a better cause, this being, community service.

A person may want to do other activities but they may not contribute to their lives very well. Community service can give a person the effort they need to be person that is well organized and that can have a good time doing so. Helping others is rewarding and the individual doing this just cause can raise the level of integrity.

Committing an action that is mandatory is something to get used to. The students that are mandated to do community service may get used to doing this service anyways and may start to enjoy it especially to do this action with friends. The opportunities, helping others and becoming a better person all seem as nice rewards from doing community service; and even so mandated, these rewards can still exist.
