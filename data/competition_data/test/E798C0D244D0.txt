Unmasking the Face on Mars

Introduction:

[The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was formed over the years. It could of been made by an alien, but that is so unreal.]

The Face on Mars was common around Cydonia, but the only thing is this face had a unusal shadow which made the face look like a Egytian Pharaoh. Over the years that have passed the Face has become more like a rock shape then a actual face. The face look like a rock that resemble a human head in some sort.

We really don't know what made the face or how the face was formed. The face was "formed by the shadows that create a illusion of eyes nose and mouth". - Unmasking the Face of Mars

Also over the years the face has become more of a pop icon that was for most popular stuff. Honestly how could the face be created by an alien when it was such in human formed, but the over the years change rock like. The Face has been compare to some of the Earth natural landfrom. It look like Snake River Plain of Idaho. I think that the face is an artifact that was formed over years ago from its natural landform and hasn't been seen into now.
