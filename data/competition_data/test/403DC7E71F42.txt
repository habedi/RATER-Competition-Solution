Imagine the last few days of school when you're just about ready to enter summer break, but you remember that you have summer projects to do over the break. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they will continue learning during the break. Knowing they are school related projects, most are teacher-designed but since they're given to students over their summer break, they should be student-designed. Students could include their interests, in relation to some educational topics, and they would be most likely to do it. Projects over the summer seem like a waste of time and effort, but would that thought change if students created and designed them?

Summer projects could still be educational with involving the students likes and interests. Kids and teens around the same age have common interests, they know what they enjoy and what they don't. Since they have friends they were planning to spend time with, they could create group projects to complete them with and it would start to feel less like school work. Some students were probably looking forward to break and no school, but didn't have any big plans for the summer. The assignments could be a big help to those to enjoy and better their summer by having some sort of fun and enjoyment. With their interests and likes in mind, student-designed summer projects would encourage students to actually complete them. They could see something in the directions of the assignments that can potentially catch their attention. Most projects are a learning experience and there are some students who aren't good at paying attention or listening at school. While they're completing their projects, they could come to the realization that they enjoy learning new material and other school related things.

Although student-designed summer projects sounds like a good idea, teacher-designed projects could be a lot more beneficial. They could help us prepare for the next school year or grade level and give us a head start. Teachers include more useful information and content in their assignments and of course they know what is best for their students learning wise.

Closing my take on this position, I greatly believe that summer assignments should be student-designed. Teachers are the ones creating the projects now, but students are not enjoying or completing them. Teens and children could still be receiving their learning experience while involving their interests. It could also increase the amount of students completing their assignments. Teacher-designed summer projects could be a little more helpful; however, students deserve to enjoy and have fun on their break.
