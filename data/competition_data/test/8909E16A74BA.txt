I am against the development of driveless cars. It is risky driving regular cars today. You have a lot of careless drivers. Then there are still accident going on currently. Also there could be problems with the driveless car we might not know about.

There are a lot of careless drives out on the road. It wouldn't be such a good idea to put a careless driver in a driveless car. It could cause danger for that person and those around them. Lots of people would take advantage of a driveless car, and wouldn't be aware of the dangers that follow. Before anyone gets into a driveless car we need smart drivers.

There are still many car crashes today. Berfore we begin to make cars that can drive by itself we need to figure out how to stop car crashes now. In the article it says that if the car is in danger, or coming across a contrustion zone whatever the case may be, it would alert the driver to take the wheel. But shouldn't it be the other way around some drives might panic or won't know what to do. Since it is a "smart" car it should be able to handle situations like that. Drving is very easy anyone can do it. I wouldn't consider a car being smart because it can drive on it's own, it's different, just not smart. A smart car will keep you out of danger if any comes your way. It would make sure you are safe.

In the article it says that the cars are

"computer-driven cars". Computers freeze, glitch, slow down, and much more. Since these cars are computer-driven it wouldn't be safe if glitches happen. It may put your life in danger and those around you. Computers still have problem,and a computer-driven car would just add on to the problems.

I am against the idea of driveless cars. It is a very risky thing to do in the future. We have careless drivers, car crahes, glitches, and other things that need to be solved before we have a computer-driven car driving on our roads. It may be an interesting idea, but we want safety for our people. Driveless cars is really something to think about.
