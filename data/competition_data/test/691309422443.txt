Trophies, medals, awards and praise, our school could use a lot more of these and you could too! Why not make your contribution by joining an extracurricular activity? Coming home to too much free time and nothing to do is something we all suffer from, so is simply not being included. Our students should listen to our principal and solve this lonely epidemic of too much free time while doing what you're good at and what you love by joining a club, sport or any extracurricular activity! Students should all participate in an extracurricular because they have the opportunity to feel included in a team, be acknowledged for their talents, and improve their skills.

Feeling included isn't something anyone can just make happen, and the cliche "just talk to people" isn't very helpful in a school with thousands of other students. It is hard for one to put themselves out there. However, when in an extracurricular, students are surrounded by people who chose to be there because they have the same interests as them. When there are people who are just like you by your side, you can easily find a common interest to bond over rather than talking about nothing to someone who you know nothing about, a stranger. Students have peers within that group or club also need them for that extracurricular because no matter what they are apart of, an extracurricular makes a team! No one can be excluded in a team, because every member works together and relies on each other. Being apart of a club or sport means students are surrounded by their friends who all are doing what they love together, almost like a family.

Imagine, a student is out there and doing what they love most and what they are best at, once they're finished, students are rewarded with trophies, medals, and praise! it's almost everyone's fantasy, so make it reality! students should not daydream about what their life could be and what they want it be when it is a very real possibility to make happen! Our students deserve to be acknowledged for their amazing talents. There is always something for everyone. Join an extracurricular activity to get credit where credit is due.

No one can ever be perfect and there is always something one can improve of themselves. However, no one may never be able to improve and build their skills if a situation does not present itself for one to realize what their weakness is. It is hard to meet such an opportunity if we never take risks and "play it safe". An extracurricular will help us improve those weaknesses and even our strong ones to be the best that we can be by presenting us with a new challenge everyday. Those skills may be related to our athletic or mental capabilities, but no matter what activity students may be apart of, it is certain one can improve their teamwork and cooperation skills. students are also working with their peers who may have more experience and can help guide them through obstacles and can share their wisdom on how to improve their skills.

Taking risks and trying something new is always scary. However, there will always be an excuse not to do something and we will never know what we are missing out on if we never even try. we could surprise ourselves and others by going beyond our expectations and being able to tell the story of the time we tried something new. Students may just be alone and feeling excluded with the push needed to encourage them to get them outside and into the open. An extracurricular will always lead students to new opportunities like being apart of a team, building skills with those around them, and being praised and rewarded for what they are best at.
