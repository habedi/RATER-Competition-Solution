If you become a seagoing cowboy like me then you will never see the world the same. You travle to all these places like Greece,Venice,Crete,China and The Panama Canal. I have been to all of these places and they were beutifull. You get to try new foods and meet new people. You can wander away to explore in your free time. You can even see famous buildings and landmarks.

By helping people you will feel better about yourself. Your making the world a better place every day. Your giving people food and water. Your also helping animals. You learn how to take care of cattle and horses. You have to feed,clean,and make shure they have enough to drink. It may sound hard but its fun with all the friends your doing it with. Sometimes you have to work other jobs on the ships like being a watchman.

On the ship you have some free time. You can play games like baseball and volleyball in emptey holds were animals have been kept. You can play other games like table-tennis, fencing,and boxing. Reading,whittiling and games like checkers or chess also helped pass time.

Being a Seagoing cowboy was somthing more than an adventure for me. I got to see so many new places . Im so gratefull my friend Don Reist invited me to go to europe ono a cattle boat. I couldn't pass it up becase it was the opportunity I would never get offerd agian. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people recover from World War II. I was aware of people and ther needs. My faimly hosted international students for a number of years. I really hope you consider becoming a Seagoing Cowboy after reading this.
