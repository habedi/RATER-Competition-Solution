Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Teaching methods have changed a lot over the years. Advances in technology have allowed many new teaching methods and ways. Students can take classes without actually being in a classroom. Opponents incorrectly believe students would not benefit from taking classes at home because of distractions and no social interactions. Although some believe students would not benefit from attending classes at home, it should be known students would benefit taking classes at home.

Furthermore, students would benefit taking classes at home because of time management. A student would benefit from online classes with time management because of a job. A student may have a job while in school. If a student is working during school hours they will not be able to attend school during that time. When taking online courses, the student may be able to fit in a session within the time they are not working. Students would benefit from attending classes at home because of making up work. A student may miss a day and have to make up missed work. If there is an emergency, and a student cannot attend an online lesson or session, the missed session could be recorded and viewed again. A student could view a whole day of lessons they have missed. Students would benefit from classes at home because of more time to practice and study. In a person's spare time, they could study and review online lessons from before. If a student is struggling with a subject and a lesson was recorded, the person can review the lessons associated with the subject. A student can be more successful reviewing lessons.

Next, students benefit from taking classes at home because a student could work more efficiently. One can work at their own pace. A student can work at a sufficient pace they are comfortable with. If a person works at a slow pace, they do not have to be strapped for time as much at home rather than at school. A person can get work done more efficiently. Taking classes at home could allow a student to get more done because of work environment. The atmosphere of an area could affect a student's work. If a student is in a comfortable and familiar environment like in their home, they could get more done. Working at home can benefit a student because there is no peer pressure. A student will not be as pressured as they are while in school. A student may present a project and they are really nervous about it but, while taking online courses the student would not have to worry about peer pressure. A student's confidence and focus could be benefited.

Even though others think students would not benefit taking classes at home, it should be known students benefit from taking classes at home. Opponents wrongly think students do not benefit from taking classes at home because of laziness and lack of organization. However, students benefit from taking classes at home because of managing time like catching up on schoolwork online when occupied with a job, making up work and reviewing lessons during spare time, and reviewing weak subjects in an online session at home. Additionally students benefit from taking classes at home because a student could work more efficiently as a result of working at their own pace, working in a comfortable environment, and no peer pressure. People need try new things they will be comfortable with. People must not hesitate on interests that will benefit them.
