Dear Mrs. Principal:

I am writing to inform you that in my opinion, all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year. I think that community service can improve character and also encourage students to help others. Many schools across the country have begun to require a certain amount of community service hours as part of their final grades.

As far as improving character goes, I believe community service can be a huge help. If a student volunteers picking up trash, they will have someone in charge of giving them directions for where and when to pick up trash. They will be required to respect this person and obey this person's instructions, which is what students must do in school very often. I believe that students are purposefully resistant towards teacher and administration figures, but if they have someone outside of school teaching them respect and obedience, their tendency to respect authority figures in school will be stronger.

I also believe community service can build character because of the impact that it can have on your life. Some children have never experienced the feeling of accomplishment when they know they have done something to help another person. If you choose to volunteer in children's hospital, the reactions from the sick children you are helping can be truly inspiring. I think this teaches kids to be grateful, thus building character.

In conclusion, I believe community service can only benefit students in this school. I believe the overall school behavior would improve and I believe we would grow stronger as a school community. Therefore, I think all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year.
