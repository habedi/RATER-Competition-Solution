I agree with policy 1, I believe that if you have your phone of in class then you are ok cause you have no distractions. Other than that I think that you can have your phones out at lunch and free period cause you are not learning anything at those specific times. During lunch you are already socializing so why not let our phones be out cause that is socializing to except it is on a phone and not talk to your friends and passing note to them also. Almost every one has phones what is the point of having them if you can not use them out side of our core classes and related arts. If we are in free period and lunch I thing the should be expectable. We learn all day and sometimes we just need a break. I think that our phones relive stress cause you are thinking about your phone not what is going on like drama and grades. I am one of the people that always keep their phone in my locker unless it is a field trip or you are able to have our phones out.

Some of our teachers keep their phone on and out on their desk.

If we are not aloud to have our phones out in class they should be aloud to do it either. It is like taunting us like saying we can have our phones out and you can't over and over. When they use them during class really irritates me because they are supposed to be teaching and we are supposed to be listening and learning. Half of my teachers do this and I wish they wouldn't cause if they are not at school to teach then why are they here wasting my time and wasting theirs too? That is a concept that just blows my mind. So just allowing to have our phones out during lunch and free periods will take our mind of all the stress and drama that goes on thro out the days at school. Whether it be at home with home work or at school I think we should be allowed to have these devices out for a less stressful day of school don't you? Cause most of the kids at school would highly agree with me just telling you this thought. Just take a gander at this and if it doesn't work then go back to having no phones.
