Should summer projects be students or teacher designed? Students should have the option of being able to create their own project during the summmer because more than likely they will do what they have in mind rather than the teacher. Although students would most likely do the projects if its optional for them to do, teacher assigned projects would be more edcational for the students. If students are allowed to design their own project they will be more interested into what they are doing. Giving the option of allowing students would be more diverse in opinions and amazing different ideas. If the teacher assigned the summer project they may no be so much interested into what the project is on, but if they are able to come up with things it will be easier.

Students dont have alot of decison making when it comes to educational purposes. Students should atleast be able to design their own summer project, which of course would be educational related. All school year, they have to follow the directions and go by what their teachers tell them to do. So therefore, they should have the option of coming up with their own project idea. During the summer their are alot of adventures the students overcome, making a projects out of the cool things they did over summer would be a great summer project. Students dislike projects, but if they are given the option to free hand, they will be more than likely to participate. They will have a little more leadway and more options to base off of. School isnt fun and projects arent either, so make things better and let the students have the option to create their own summer project.

Teacher designed projects are not always so fun and interesting. School projects are usually "one for all" meaning everyone is assigned the same project. Futhermore, letting students design and present their own project would more rational. There will be more diverse opinions,so all the projects wouldnt be the same. It would be a variety of different project ideas. Nevertheless, while the teacher is grading this projects,he or she, wont be grading all the same thing, you will see different point of views and more creative ideas the students have come up with. Asigning a project on what the students did over the summer, or just letting them come up with things by themselves would be interesting for the teacher grading instead of grading the same thing over and over. Since students attend school all year and the only break they have is summer, they should be allowed to design an project for themself.

Student projects desinged from students will be more convincing to do. If students hear their teacher telling them she or he is asigning a prject they wont be as excitied. No one like projects, so therefore if they are giving the option to take it upon themselves to create a project they will most likely participate. When students think of projects, they think of dreadfulness, so letting them do a free project will be more interesting to them because they wont have to think about the if its right or wrong, its based upon them. The summer design project is an good idea for the students to do because most likely they will engage more since its more orientated with them and not the teacher just assigning a project to the students. For example, say if you are in school and your teacher says "you all have an project coming up on family speices " versus " you all have a project coming up and you will be able to do anything on it as long as it is school appropiate. Which one sounds more interesting to you? Furthermore, the students have to be engaged to be able to want to do something. School isnt fun, thats why teacher and administrators should help the school be more interesting for the students.

Students should have the option because they are more than likely to do what they have in mind rather than the teacher. Teacher projects are not great all they time but letting the students have the option is more helpful to them. Students dont like school projects, but if they are given the option, the teacher would probably see more grades increasing and more particaption reports. You never know what students are capable of, but giving them the option of designing a project on their own would be great to also see their talents or on how smart they are. If you were a student would you rather have a teacher present a project to you or would you rather create a project on your own?
