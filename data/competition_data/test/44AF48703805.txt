To TEACHER_NAME:

Community service is something that I believe that we should all be helping with at some point in our lives, as it greatly benefits the community, of course, and it can help us feel better about ourselves. I know that some of our friends would think it would be a waste of their precious time to even pick up trash instead of going about with their comfortable daily lives, but participating in community service can and does have its benefits.

I know that you are already debating on whether or not all students should participate in community service, but maybe a few opinions from some of the school's students might influence your decision, if you haven't already made your decision.

I do believe that we both know not all students will want to volunteer for community service the first time, as what I did the first time I was given the option. Community service includes tutoring elementary school kids and clearing the streets from litter. It's some form of assistance that benefits the community and will pave the way to a better future, and even though I don't necessarily agree with the idea that all students should be required to participate in community service, I think that the option to participate should be given.

A simple example would be to pick up trash and litter off the streets. That keeps the place looking clean and it keeps the city life forms healthy (By that I mean the small animal and birds that hang out in the city.) Cleaning something should be something that we all know how to do, and picking up litter would satisfy the people who are new to community service.

Of course, voluntarily participating in any even tor activity means that you want to do it on your own time and accord. Not all people would want to participate, but for those who do, it helps the city in a huge way. After all, one person alone can't do all the jobs and work that is required for many people to do.

Sincerely,
