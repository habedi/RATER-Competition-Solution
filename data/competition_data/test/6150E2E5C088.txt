Luke was a young adult who just graduated from high school and became a Seagoing Cowboy with his friend Don Reist. (Yeeha) Being a cowboy must be exciting for him I imagine. After World War II was over, many countries were in ruins. 44 nations picked in to help the countries and they needed Seagoing cowboys to help the animals that were stuck in sea, so Luke and Don signed up to help.

They found a bunch of horses first with a number of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town," Luke says. He toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama canal on his way to china.

It took a month to get to China, but they finally got there. Caring for the animals they rescued kept Luke busy. It was more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world to him.
