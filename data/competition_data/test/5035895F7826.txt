Technology is a semi-new thing, therefore using it to benifit peoples learning is a major aspect of technology. Technology is used for entertainment, and creating ways of excitment in people. However technology is also used as a weapon in negative ways, like look at the internet for example; this form of technology is used for positive reasons and negative reason. However when used in positive ways the internet is and can be used a an amzing source of positivity and a benifital tool to those who use it.

Classrooms in america are getting more strict and incressing in difficulty mainly, due to the amount of difficulty it takes to master areas in which people want to succeed; like the job field for example now days jobs are harder to access therefore schools are tying to give their students an upper hand in this field.

Monotorying has always been a thing ever since it was possible, there are positive and negative sides to this phenominon. There are companies who use monotring as a negative thing; like say spying on an employs dailey activities besides work, however companies can use this form of monoturing on checking to see if there is something a employey has problems with a spesific thing at a job site.

Overall I think that technology along with it negative aspects can be a positive tool twards benifiting peoples lives, just like educuation. Educational staff are only seeking healty lives and suitiable jobs for those they teach and support. So therefor teachers and staff using technology is postitive ways can be a benifical tool.

Emotion tracking technology is a new advancement that could weave into a new direction and form of how our schooling sysetem works. this could be a very good thing for us a society as a whole. I personally thing that is a great idea for students that have near given up on schooling and the system itself.

Technology is used for entertainment, and greative ways of exciting people. Therefore in conclusion i do belive that using positive forms of technology to help further students learning and productivity is a major step in the right direction. Collages nowadays are only accepting students that are determinded and not afriad to go that extra step for themselves and others, and if teachers use a form of technology can futher those skills, then this can be a very good topic of disscusstion. In conclusion i would like to see a new and improved form of technology that will help teachers and staff get the knowledge to kids and young adults in need for a better life than say not having the new and impoved technological advances we have as a society now.
