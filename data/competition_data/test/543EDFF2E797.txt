The idea of limiting car usage is a outstanding plan. Because of this idea it helps out everybody in a way so that there are good advantages. By limitig the usage of cars the air will have less polution and that means better air for us to breath. In france diesal makes up 67 percent of vehicles, witch is definately not helping the polution problem. If people use their cars less that means that they save money on gas. Ovcourse the proble is the smog in that country so that os why they want to limit the driving. Like it says over the past two decades they want to make the cities denser, and better for walking in the suburbs. In the suburbs make i more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less space for parking. All the development since world war II has been centered on the car. David Goldberg said a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the united states ... who are promoting new communities that areÂ less dependent on cars. That will be a good thing because it is an advantage of less polution in the atmosphere. So that is all of the advantages of less car usage.
