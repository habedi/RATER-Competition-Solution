"Do really think the face on Mars was created by aliens?"Chloe said softly. "Yes", said Jeannie. "Jeannie how in the world could you believe that?" Exclaimed Chloe. "I have always been told that and I truly believe that!" said Jeannie. "Maybe one day you will know the truth ,or I could tell you about the truth now if you want?" "Sure lets hear it" softly said Jeannie.

"Well the face on Mars was created naturally because aliens are not real." Chloe quoted. "Yes they are" arrgued Jeannie. "If they are real then where is the proof." Shouted Chloe! "Well you see there really is no proof I just know the face could not have been made naturally." quitely said Jeannie. "Exactally, I have proof and you do not, so I think I am the right one in this arrgument." Fastly said Chloe. "Where is the proof then if you acctually have some?" Snobbily said Jeannie. "My proof is right here. You want me to read it out to you?" said Chloe. "Yeah go ahead", said Jeannie. "Okay, in the story "Unmasking the Face on Mars" paragraph 3 it states that the face is a huge rock formation and the eyes, nose, and mouth are formed from shadows." Claimed Chloe. "Well how is that proof?" asked Jeannie. "The scientist that wrote the story is the one who gave me the infomation from the book. You see the aliens could not just make a rock the shape of a face." Stated Chloe. "Oh I kinda understand where you are coming from Chloe, now to think about it, my story sounds kinda dumb." said Jeannie.

In the end Jeannie really starting understanding me and was less naive towards the world. She kinda realized the rock face was not made by aliens and she kinda led herself to the truth! So it all worked out and we are not arguing anymore about the face on Mars. Acctually in June on the sixteenth day of the 2016th year we are going to Mars to see the face. So I hope you and your people can get through arrguments like we accomplished.
