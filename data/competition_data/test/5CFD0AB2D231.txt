I think that making students have a B average to be able to do sports or other after school activities would be a very bad idea. Mainly because many of my fellow students and I have a C average and some maybe lower. My friends and I love to do sports and we do work hard to keep our C averages. But if you take away our chance of doing sports that would be like taking away our motivation to keep learning and actually trying in school. Especially when we are in the eighth grade and our sports skills as well as our school skills are starting to really blossom. I also believe that when kids are in a sport or any after school activity end up doing much better in school.

Plus think of all the hard work students have put in to really getting the chance to play a sport or participate in an after school activity. Remember back when you were in school how hard it truly was to keep your grades up? Also think of the kids that need sports or activities to stay out of trouble or to have that extra motivation to keep their grades up. This is when students start realizing whether they really want to do this or not and some may possibly become famous at their sport or activity. But if you end up taking away that chance by changing the rules that would be crushing someone's hopes and dreams because of how hard they worked to keep their C averages.

Also I think our schools sport teams are small enough as it is, and by taking out those students with a C average we wouldn't even have girl sports and the boys would end up having the numbers that the girls used to have, which is barely enough. Plus think of all the other thinks they can do now but wouldn't be able to with the new rule.

I believe that you would just be trying to help but in reality all you would be doing is hurting us. Many kids also need sports to stay in shape. I think our country is overweight enough already and without kids being able to do sports they would easily gain weight. Also think of the students with troubles at home and do these after school activities to stay away from the drama at home for as long as possible, but would have to suffer through it even longer all because they have a C average. Is that something you really want hanging over you shoulders? I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was doing that to some poor innocent child. So I'm sure you wouldn't be able to either.

So i conclude that even if all you were doing was trying to help, your outcome didn't turn out that way. All you would be doing is taking away a kids hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. So please from my fellow students and I we ask you and strongly advise you with all the hope in our hearts that you will listen and DO NOT change the rules. Thank you for listening and I hope that I changed your ways of thinking.
