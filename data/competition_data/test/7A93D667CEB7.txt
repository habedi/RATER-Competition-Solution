The author supports this idea because he brings it up more than once. For instance in the beginning of the passage the author mentions that the spacecraft has used cameras and other robots. The sad part is they didn't survive more than a few hours."humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours."

The author gives details on certain things that we should be aware of. He doesn't just release it with one fact and stay with that. He tells the people about stuff we already know about or things that aren't healthy for humans. "A thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atomsphere. On the plansureface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;" As humans we know what nhow our bodies will react to tempatures like that. The author isn't sugarcating anything for humans.

My conclusion to this is that the author he is telling the truth despite the dangers like possibly dying before coming within two feet of the atomsphere that Venus is a worthy pursuit the only problem is how can we pursuit it if we have nothing that can make it past it. What the author does here is really let us know the dangers then explain why it's like that. That really helps because if i didn't have that i'd be confused out of my mind.
