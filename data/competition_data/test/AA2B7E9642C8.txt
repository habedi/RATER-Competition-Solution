Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do like the fact that people have been doing community service at the school but some of my friends think that its great and some think its not so great. Personally i like the fact that people are helping out their community and really the people that are helping it will probley pay off in the long run when they go to apply for a good job or even a good college. The people that aren't helping their community it will probley not pay off at all cause they are not doing good things to get ready for big things in their life.

Maybe the next time you have kids come and help out at the school you should have them clean up the play ground like pulling weeds or picking up trash cause sadly the play grounds are not well maintained. Also with all of thoughs kids getting sick maybe clean off all of the equipment to help make sure kids are not getting the flu or even the cold. Also with all of the good things to come and go in these kids lives I personally don't think these teens should be required to help out, it would be nice if they did but some of them may be bad influences on all of these kids. I think that if they want to help out let them but if they don't, don't make them.

Inclunclusion if these aren't wanting to help out with their community then don't make them cause its their future let them be in charge of it. If kids want to help then so be it cause they must want to have a good future, cause they are probley working hard in school and obviously are willing to do what ever they need to be successful in life.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
