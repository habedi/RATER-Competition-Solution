To the Principal

I believe the better of the two choices is policy one. I think students should have the opportunity to at least to be able to have a cell phone during a school's provided free time. It would make a lot of more people more prone to like going to their school better anyways, because they don't feel imprisoned within the school walls, like another school could make you feel like but if it were to happen in most schools some kids would take it as an excuse to use their phones during class. But if they were put on a trial period they could see who the more responsible kids with their phones are and make some sort of requirement to be able to use their phone in free time at all. Because some people don't have to work for anything and they just get it handed to them rather it would be by a rich parent or grandparent there comes a point where the hard working people should get rewarded. If you can find some responsible students then great and try it. But if you can't then you shouldn't even bother with it and use policy two.
