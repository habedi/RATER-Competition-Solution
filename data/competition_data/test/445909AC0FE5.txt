Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my honest opinion i think we should we should use policy 1 because its great idea. And its also reasonable how we have to turn it off during class time is good too cause we need to focus on our school work. Many students in my school would like for policy 1 to be accepted.

We should be able to use our phones during lunch periods and other free times because if teachers get to do so then we can't us students either. I think that's not very fair because the rules should apply to everyone at the school don't you think? And teachers not only are able to use their phones on their free time but do it other times too which really isn't good but i think this isn't fair how they get to use their phones on their free time and we don't.

I think its a great idea how policy 1 said we can use our phones in lunch but need to turn it off during class time. Education always comes first so that rule i truly respect but it isn't a bad rule anyway. I know like 90% of the students in the school would so follow this rule because the fact that we have the advantage to use the phones during lunch periods and other free time they would follow this rule just so we are able to use phones at lunch.

Probably about 70% of the teachers in the school will highly agree to this policy because since the students are able to use the phones in lunch time but would have to turn it off during class time would be a very good thing they would have against us. Like for example if a student is caught using their phone during class the teacher would probably write them up so they would get after school detention but then the vice principal would also get involved and what if she said' s we lost the advantage to use phones during lunch just because one student from the entire school but that mat happen if this is happening to many students.

I know for a fact if this policy is accepted for the school mostly all the students of the school would love that and take advantage but good advantage. And I know they would respect the rule that we can't use them in class because the fact that we will be able to use them on our free time and lunch would just be awesome for us students. Now if this policy is accepted you wouldn't regret it because as class president I would even give a speech and heads up to the students about this.

Your Student,
