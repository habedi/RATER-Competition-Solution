Facial Action coding is not useful i don't think technology can read someone's emotions because in paragragh 2 it states that "how can a computer recoginize the subtle facial movements we humans use to ezpress how we feel" so how can we technology read someone's emotions.

Can the Facial action coding really read how humans feel like how can you read how he/she feel just by looking at them in paragragh 4 it states that "each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)" if the computur compares your face to another one how do it really know how your feeling how is ti getting the presentages and is it really right about how you feel.

The computer can tell you how you look or how it looks like hoe you feeling but in a picture it probably look like how you feel but how do the computer really know how you feel after or before you took the picture. what if you just did a regular smile but you felt sad would the computer read that you are sad and not happy.

In the Mona LIsa it looks like she is happy in the first paragragh it states that "she's 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearfuland 2 percent angry" how do the computer know that she is angry how can a computer read the perfect percent of how you are feeling.

I think that people don't need a computer that can tell them how happy,sad or mad because that's their feelings so how do they know that they are feeling that way. In my opion only one person can tell you how happy or sad and mad you are is your self because those are your feelings and some people choose to express their feelings but some don't.
