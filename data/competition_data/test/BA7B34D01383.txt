Schools have started to allow students to "attend" school from home, claiming that this benefits students as a whole. While these tools may be useful in cases where schools are closed, such as winter days, I do not support School at home.

Firstly, school provides a learning environment which homes do not have. School is used for the sole purpose of learning during the daytime. This means that when you go to school, you go in with a mindset of learning. Homes do not offer this same kind of head spaceÂ for a student to learn, as they are used for many other activities, such as sleeping.

Secondly, schools have structure. You go to certain classes at certain times, you see different teachers on different days, lunch is at a set time of the day, these are all examples of structure that a school provides that you would not find in an at home learning environment. Structure helps keep students on task, focused, and listening, without this structure a student may lack or fall short in one of these areas.

Lastly, schools have peer focused learning. When you go to school, you see all your peers there for the same purpose as you, this reinforces you to be like others and focus on your school work. The "group mindset" at school is that of learning and obedience to teachers. When you are taken out of that group mindset, such as by studying from home, you lose the mentality of staying on task like your peers do. So you may choose not to do your work at all because there are no examples of others doing work.

A counterargument would be that if school was accessible from homes, students wouldn't have to worry about their attendance. However, I think that attendance is mandatory for students as it provides more structure to learning and provides them an example of what it will be like to go into the work force in their later years. As when you start a job, you must attend you job. So we should teach them this from a young age to paint the floor before they hit it. Because in life, you got to show up.

In conclusion, schools shouldn't move to a more home based learning style because schools provide a learning environment, structure, and peer focused learning, which homes cannot provide. This benefits the student in his or her learning career and prepares the for the world after school.
