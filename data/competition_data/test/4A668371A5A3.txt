Students should not be required to do a extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities are time consuming and not all students have that time. If the student has a job that is very time consuming and not understanding at all then they could possibly lose their job. Losing a job is very bad considering it's already extremely hard to find a job and on top of that they lose their source of income. If the student is making money to help out with bills or buying food they can't anymore because they dont have a source of income.

When students start doing extracurricular activities then they start to lose time with family and loved ones. When the students start losing time with family it can impact them mentally. If their family member is sick or is hardly home and they miss out on getting to see them, that can be very hard on that person. If the student has sibling they need to watch or take care of they can't anymore because they aren't home, having to do something else they might not even like. What if the student can't get rides from their family they can't just keep borrowing rides from other people

Student might have family that run a business that the are required to work at. when the student has to start doing other things like sports and clubs, they won't be able to work and help out as much with the family business anymore. This is why i think it is a bad idea to make it mandatory for students to do extracurricular activities. It will cause problems in the students life that wouldn't be there otherwise. Students should not have to be required to do extracurricular activities that negativity impact students and make life just more difficult for them.
