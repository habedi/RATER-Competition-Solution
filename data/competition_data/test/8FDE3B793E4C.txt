Dear principal,

I think we the students need to help the community. I think it is right to help people in need. My father, my sister, and I help two homeless people. We get food, cloths, and give them tents that they can sleep in. I know this is right because my uncle that's an Indian taught me to help people in need. I tilted my head when he said that. He said " You do not remember when a pack of dogs attacked you?" I said" no i do not remember." He told me what happened. He said " we got out of the car and started to go inside the house. You heard a noise and looked around to see where the noise came from. I turned around and saw you laying on the ground with a pack of dogs ripping your cloths and biting you every where they could got. I ran out towards you. The pack of dogs ran away and I picked you up. You had your eyes closed and were barely breathing. My wife called for a doctor and the doctor came. He fixed you up and said" that was a good thing that I came running to your need for help and that you need to be watched until you wake up." I stayed right by you and my wife got mad when I did not move from your side. She would come in to see how you were and saw me crying and praying that you would live." The week from the attacked happened, You started to come around. I ran to you. The doctor came to check on you and he said" she will start to act different so do not worry." I sat in a chair, holding your hand. Your eyes started to open. I yelled " hey come here everyone." They came and gathered around me. Your eyes were opening slowly then they opened fully. We smiled. You got up and tried to walk but fall. I said to you " stay in bed and rest." you did what i told you to do. I give you breakfast in bed. You started to act like a wolf so the doctor came and saw how you were acting and how hard my wife tried to stop you. He said" Its useless." My wife said " why is it useless?" the doctor said" the bites she got have made her think that she is a wolf and she will be like this for life but she will act like the way she is acting right now under a full moon maybe when under a full moon she will act a lot like a wolf and dogs will come running to her then she will run with the dogs that came to her." I get up and when to my tribe. I made a necklace for you and put it on you. I said" if it is removed you will start to go all wolf but the necklace must stay on your neck." You where okay with that.
