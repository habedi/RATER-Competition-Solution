My grandma always told me that students should be able to create their own projects, because they get to work on things they like instead of being forced to do what the teachers want. Students should design their own projects because they get to have their own freedom and pick things that excite them.

Students should get to design their own summer project, because they get to pick whatever topic they want. For example students learn more when its about something they like because they don't have somebody always telling them what to do and how to do it. This also gives kids the opportunity to be creative, get out of their comfort zone, and to explore new things instead of learning what the teachers want them to learn. This proves that students should be able to come up with the summer projects instead of teacher.

Some people think the teachers should design the projects because teachers know more than students, however they're wrong because that sets a bad example for the students because they're going to think everything is always going to be handed to them and they'll never know how to be independent. For example some kids work and do better when doing something that interestsÂ them which will motivate them to want to keep learning about it; the students also would also get to express themselves through it.

If you think students should be able to do their own projects then you should switch it up here and there so they can do things on there own to show that they're responsible and don't always need a teacher to do everything for them.
