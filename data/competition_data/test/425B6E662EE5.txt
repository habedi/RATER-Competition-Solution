The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to idenify human emotions. I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a clasroom is valuable for these reasons.

In the article it says that," Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness." Then he will associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscle. Another reason that I think is valuable is when in the article it says that." In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by look on her."

This is why I think the use of this technology is valuable. So that we can test which of the six emotions we are in. The second reason is that we human are already perform the same impressive calcauation every day.
