Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. I think this because students won't be so anxious to text in class or use their phone during class at all because they will just wait until lunch time or passing period. I also think that it would be much better because the students won't even think about texting in class. But if the teacher or you find them texting in class just take their phones away and have their parents come and pick the phone up. Also if it gets out of hand just change Policy 1 to Policy 2. Then again you never know if the student is texting in class for good reasons like if he/she forgot to write down the homework and they're asking a friend in an other class what the homework was. So those two policies are a tough argument but I hope my letter tells you something.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
