I believe that the use of this technology would be valuable, as long as students sign off or allow their emotions to be detected by this software. It could be valuable to find learning plans and lessons for all students, so their learning is more interactive for them and more interesting. It could also help detect things such as depression and try report that to a parent or counselor to try and improve their situation. Eventually the software could become so advanced that it could detect suicidal thoughts, in which case, could save lives. But alas, students would have to be okay with this technology being used on them, otherwise it's an invasion of privacy.

A professor by the name of Dr. Huang at Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois is working in collaboration with Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang taught a computer what facial muscles equal what emotion. If this software was implemented into school computers, I wouldn't see a problem with that. By implementing this software students could have a more interactive learning environment or a more interesting learning experience overall. But there are still flaws in this software, a student would be able to manipulate the software into only teaching them about a certain subject that they partcularly like. So the software needs more advanced fake emotion detection, and needs to teach things that "seem" boring because its still vital information humans need to live. If someone were to dislike math, but really like science and they were never taught math at all, the person would be unable to succeed in life due to this software failing.

If this software is implemented, it should not be used often. Although it can help the learning environment it can also hurt it. While I support the software being used in a learning environment, I do not condone this being put onto personal computers for financial gain or marketing purposes.
