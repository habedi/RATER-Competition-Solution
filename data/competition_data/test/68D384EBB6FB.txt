Response to Policy Change

Dear principal,

I think that your Idea is great. I don't think students should be able to engage in after school activities , unless they earn it. Making them have to get a B or higher is what students need so they can set goals for themselves. This will make both the students and the parents of the students happy.

Having this system will make students try their hardest in the classrooms. I think that all schools should enforce this policy so students can do better in life and pursue careers other than sports. Working harder in school will make the teachers and the parent of the student happy. Student may not like this rule at first, but later on they will be happy about the progress that they have made. This will then show them that they can do anything if they give it their best effort.

Another reason we should enforce this rule is because a student should be making at least a B average anyway. So this policy will get every kid involved in school. Doing this will make the student and the school look better. This rule is kind of like setting a goal for everyone in the school. I can understand a student being unhappy about this rule, but it will really help you become a successful adult.

The last reason is this; Why would any kid go to school and not try their hardest. You have to go to school anyway, so why not try your best. It is pointless to go to school if don't try to get at least a B average. You will get nowhere in life if you don't try your best to succeed.

This rule is a great idea and I think it should have been enforced a long time ago. This will push kids to try their hardest in school which would make parents and teachers happy. I believe that any student can get a B average if they try hard. In order to play sports you have to earn it. This rule will make kids earn it and I think it should be enforced everywhere.

Sincerely,

Anonymous Student
