I do not see this how a great idea because how this is going to help us?, probably we do not even want to know if we are sad or not or a computer telling if I am sad,happy ,angry,or whatever.

Unless if they saw me that i am confused when i am taking a test or doing something that i do not,they are not going to help me and that is for sure.

That is why i think its innecessary.

How can u say that this is true or this would happen? "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" maybe in the future this would happen but it is not going to help me because,my teacher is not going to change the questions because he see that i am getting confused or anything like that.

In conclusion inneed a computer can tell me if i am happy, sad,confused, or whatever but it noy going to helpe me to feel better so it not going to work.
