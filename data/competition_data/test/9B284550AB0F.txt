Dear principal,

About your community service preposition, I believe that it may be a good idea to you but you always have to think about the children that struggle in school and need extra help, just imagine how much time your taking away from them and how your going to be the one held responsible for their failing grades, and how they are now going to spend more time trying to catch up then be up their with their fellow students who with be in more advanced classes now and learning more now then the ones who are falling behind.

Which may also lead to those who may also get held back just so they can now start over on the work that they were struggling on in the first place. I think that the ones who are getting their work done, completing their task and getting their things done should be the on ones who do the community service and take time out of their day and help those who are behind. So you can now worry about those who need more help then others, and the ones that are capable of doing the community service.

Sincerely, your student
