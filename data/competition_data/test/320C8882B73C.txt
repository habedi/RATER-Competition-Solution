Dear Principal,

I strongly believe that you shouldn't change the policy for students to participate in sports or other activities.

I feel that getting B average or higher is a great thing. However, letting students participating in sports or other activities will allow them to share their thoughts to each other, teach each other different things, and also can learn from their own mistakes.

Students can talk out the situation with another person they trust.

If that person is feeling stressed before they attend the sport or the activity they can talk it out. For example, of a student has multiple assignments after school and feels stressed or overwhelmed ,that sport or other activity can or will allow them to not feel overwhelmed or stressed. This will really help them overcome their emotions of how they feel. Also, if you discuss it with someone, you can really solve the issue or make you forget all about it.

In addition, at practice of what ever sport you play or at what ever other activity you are at, you can teach other people you know or have met something and or you can learn something or multiple things from them.

Going to the activity or sport will really help you not be stuck or annoyed with the situation you have. Being at that sport or activity with all of your friends or people you really know and trust. Students who feel stressed or overwhelmed about something will soon suddenly realize how much it helps to go at that sport or activity.

Attending at the activity or sport will makes you feel different after going. You realize that going today helped a lot: talking it out, and playing with other friends. Students who feel stressed or overwhelmed and go to the activity or sport then, coming back feel different and some what proud of themselves because of what they have done and gone through. I think it's just feels amazing to me if I felt stressed or overwhelmed to talk it out with my best friends or someone I really trust.

Not changing the policy for students to go to sports and activities whether it happening in the afternoon after school or at night, will give them the chance to communicate the situation over about how they feel, share their personal thoughts to one another; in addition, to also give them the chance to learn what they've achieved; what success or victory that person has found. Therefore, I hope you understand and commit to all of the following things I have stated above.

Sincerely,
