Dear Principal,

While I understand what you are saying, it is highly unreasonable. A B would be a nice grade to maintain but, many students may not be able too.

Some students who are having trouble with comprehending the material, even with help will not be able to maintain a B average. It may be difficult and put more pressure on them causing stress. Do you want your students to be even more stressed out than they already are? I don't think you want a whole bunch of stressed out kids running around your school.

There are also some students with learning disabilities. They may be having a hard time maintaining a C average. A B would just drive them crazy.

While some students may not play sports or do other school related activities, those who do are mainly there to have fun. They may not be able to have fun if there stressed out because they have to maintain a B.

Look at your students grade before you make a decision like this. Think about your students. Think about all the stress you'll cause them. Please reconsider this rule. It would really keep the students life balanced.

Sincerely,

Student
