Dear Principal,

I have noticed you are weighing two possible alternatives for cell phones in your hands.

You might think turning cell phones off will help studying in class, but if someone needed to call their parents how would they?

If you were already in school forgot something at home or had to stay after, would they use the school phone or would they be stuck there and left?

As a non-phone user it would be very difficult to contact any of my parents or sisters to pick me up.

If you give students time during lunch and other free time you and us, the students, will get what we want.

If you don't give students phones at school they might still use them anyways and say that

"it was an emergency."

Phones do cause problems so I see if you disagree, but students hardly change.

Students are always trying to communicate no matter what you can't stop that.

Limiting students is going to be better rather than telling them "no phones."

That would make them more susceptible to try to disobey school rules.
