Dear principal,

I think that the students at our school should be required to do community service.

It is a very positive way to get us to engage in our community.

It's a great way to help our society, it makes others happy, and it sets a good example for others.

Firstly, it's a great way to help our society.

One way to help is cleaning up the side of the road.

By doing this, the walkways are clearer and it looks better.

It might be a big task for one or two people, but if everyone helps out, it will be done in no time.

It only takes a little bit of help to make our community a better place to live.

Secondly, doing community service makes others happy.

For example, we could tutor elementary school children.

It won't be hard for us since we already know the stuff they are learning.

It also makes them happy because it makes them feel smart, so they won't get stressed out and have a tantrum.

They will receive better grades which will make their parents proud of them.

You could also help run a daycare for little kids.

It would make the person running it very happy since he/she won't have to do it by themselves.

Lastly, it sets a good example for others.

If we do community service which makes our community happier and cleaner, others who think it's stupid will want to help.

If everyone is doing it, surely others will want to join so they won't feel left out.

If we want to set a good example for our peers, we should start as soon as possible.

In conclusion, making community service a requirement, will help our society, make others happy, and set a great example for others.

With all this put together, we could live in a better and happier place for everyone.

It only takes a few to start something big, so why not start now?

Sincerely,
