Dear principal,

I am not here to argue with you but I do not agree with you that there should be a policy change that you have to have a B average to play a sport. Sports and grades are two totally different things in my opinion. Kids are already having a hard time getting a C average just to play a sport. Even some kids can't get a C average to play a sport so they can't do it. I think it's ridiculous that you have to have a certain grade average to play a sport. Sports are a activity; not getting homework in on time or studying for a test. Those are two totally different topics to me.

If you changed the school policy so that you have to have a B average to participate in school activities or school sports you wouldn't have as many kids in sports or you might even have kids moving to other schools. Kids would defiantly try harder to get their grades up but teachers may not understand how hard it is to do those kind of things. Changing the school policy so that you have to have a B average is not understandable to me. Other students may not agree with me or you may not agree with me but people that want to play sports will agree with me 100%.

Like I've said before, school grades and sports are not the same thing in my opinion. Sports are handling a challenge with another team or learning how to play the sport and grades are understanding life and the history of everything. Learning how to write stories and learning how to handle a ball are two totally different things. I would just like to end this with you should not change the school policy so that you have to have a B average to play sports or be in activities but you have the total control over it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
