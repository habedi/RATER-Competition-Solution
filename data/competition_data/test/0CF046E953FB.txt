Dear Principal,

I think us students shouldn't perform community service.

But for those people who wants to help community should. Not all students have time to do community service because of their after school activities, even though they want to. Some students doesn't want to do community service because they don't think that it isn't very important. For those who want to should sign up and for those who doesn't want to do it should give a different task.

Some students, like me have after school activities. But doesn't find time to help the community to do so. I think having students community service is a great idea but some people just don't find the time. So I'm thinking that for those who want to, should just give donation, or the school should have a field trip making all the students do community service. So everyone helps the community.

For those people who doesn't want to do community service should be a given a task that involves the community. Like having students help around school, helping the teachers or cleaning around school, or go around or ask their family to donate money for a community. Simple things help the community in little ways. By just picking up trash looks a little different, but it is a big help.

For those students who has time to help should sign up for after school, or during school activities, like go to elementary school and teach children how to read, or count. Some people could help the mailman deliver mail to people so the mailman doesn't have to go around a lot.

Students could gather around the park and clean up, also help those elders who needed help.

Others could help the librarian to put the books in the right places. Have students do a car wash to help support school supplies, so each students in the school don't have to share supplies.

Sincerely,
