Students after a long and rested summer break usually come back to school in August forgetting what they learned the previous year. To assure that students continue to learn over their break they should be able to make their own project instead of having a teacher designed project.

Summer projects should be student designed as it provides more creativity and freedom in their work, as well as it shows that they understand the given content by the teacher, but the project may not be easy to understand and complete compared to a teacher designed project.

A student designed project over Summer break creates creativity in the students because they would have to break their boundaries in order to discover what they need to create in their project. Students will also have more freedom because they will be able to chose their topics based on their own interest. This allows students to be excited to learn during their summer break; for example, if they are allow to choose what their project will be based about they will be more productive and continue to learn more as they will have an interest in their work unlike a teacher designed project that students might disagree on and become less productive to a topic that creates no satisfaction towards the students. That is terrible for the schools when students arrive back to school over break as they would not have learn as much because their topic was not interesting and maybe some would choose not to complete the teacher designed project because of the topic.

Allowing students to create their own project also visualizes that they understood their teacher content, by taking their teacher content and combining it to their own ideas into a project that shows the teacher that the students still remembers what they learn over summer break. While a teacher design project does not show if a student fully understand the content because every student will all have the same ideas and will be unable to show what new content they learned over the summer.

Because student gets to work on their interests which may be different then what they learn in their school year, they would have to do research to learn new topics that they never could have done with a teacher design project. A teacher project would not need to research new topics as they would just need to revise on what they learned over the school year. Thats why a student design project is better for learning for when they return back to school they would've had learned new content.

A teacher designed project is the least choice for a summer project. Although, it does have its own benefits such as being less stressful on students to work on this project because they will already know the basics and what to do for the project. They would be able to work together helping student understand the content more; for example, they would look over each other work making sure that they understand that they are doing the project correctly. Teacher designed project allows student to refresh and review what they learned during the school year over Summer break, that a student design project will be unable to accomplish due to the fact that teacher designed project is mainly about what they already learn instead of expanding into new topics.

In order to allow students to learn over their Summer break they would need student designed project to allow them to learn new things while also giving them more creativity that will help them out when they return to school. The student design allows for opportunity for the students to choose what they might want to do in the future and interest while a teacher design is not fully capable of doing the same. Allowing student designed project will help schools and student grow and learn while they are on break so that they don't come back to school forgetting main topics and having to waste time relearning such topics.
