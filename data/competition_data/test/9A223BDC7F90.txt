The author says a lot about studying venus. there are many examples of what venus is like and how it compares to earth. NASA wants to send people to venus to study it. But going to study venus could be very dangerous for many reasons.

as used in paragraph 3, the author states that

"the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide" . He then also sates that " on the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Also that the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our on planet." i believe that NASA shoudnt send our people over to the planet because it is way to dangerous.

in conclusion, venus is a earth like planet that NASA studies. i believe that we shouldnt send our people to study because its to dangerous. Also at the same time it would be a great project to study. NASA is going to continue to study venus. its going to be a hard and dangerous planet to study, but they will get the job done.
