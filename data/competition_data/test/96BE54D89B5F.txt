In my opinion I believe that the use of this technology is great because in the text it was stated that "a classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored" and since mosts students dont like to speak up maybe the teacher can ask them after class if they understood the subject or the lesson that day.

But everything has an opposing side. This could also not be a benefit because maybe if someone has a private feeling saying maybe like a crush and the computer states something like "in love" maybe thats something they wanted to keep for themselves. well mainly that would depend on the teacher you have or if she/he will tell anyone but id doubt it.

Some feelings are also really difficult to understand like maybe the computer can bring the wrong emotion or mis calculate how you are feeling. " the facial expressions for each emotion are universal," according to Dr. huang.
