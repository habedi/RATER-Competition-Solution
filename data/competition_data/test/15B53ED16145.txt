Though Venus could be very dangerous doesn't mean it shouldn't be explored, like the author is trying to say. The temperatures are very deadly and very dangerous to be around but nothing is impossible.

It could be possible to try and make sometype of ships to travel to Venus but then again there might not be a way in getting much evidence that anybody actually made it up there and came back to Earth alive. It's very unsafe and peoples skin is just very sensitive to heat. Like the auther said, "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth." There isn't much you can do to fight back very high temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

The challenges are only going to make people wonder more about Venu until it is actually explored. Until then nothing is impossible and there will be creative people out there that find a way in making the trip to Venus one to remember. Nothing should be limited by the dangers and doubts of meeting goals.
