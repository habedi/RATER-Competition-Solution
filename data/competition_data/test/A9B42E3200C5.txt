Venus has had a lot of research put into it . they ave put spacecrafts of many kinds on it ,but they can not last on there for more then a few hours. some belive it is because ofthe high heats on that plant ,also it might be because of the pressure in the air and it messes with the craft. scientest are still not 100% sure as to what it is quiet yet.

Earth and Venus are a like in some ways. they are the closest alike within all the plants in the solar system . they both have large bodys of ocean on them and creatures on them . NASA wants to maybe someday have someone land on Venus ,but that would be way to dangerous becasue of the heat . also venus has almost no oceans anymore . another thing is that they have really thick and heavy clouds on them and that may harm them.

NASA is testing diffrent types of spacecrafts and putting the min chambers that are simaloar to Venus . some last up to a few minties till a few weeks for others . it all just depends on how it is made. a lot o fpeople are fasanated by venus and how are solar system works . because venus and earth are so close to each other but venus has such high temputures and it is weird because earth is not like that. another thing is sometimes earth is closer to mars then it is to venus , because of how the earth moves.
