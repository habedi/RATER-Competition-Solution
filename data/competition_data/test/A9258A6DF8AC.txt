I disagree with the decision that the principle made with having that every single student has to take a extracurricular activity. Why i choose to disagree is that there nothing far about be force to do something that you do not want to do. "Ian you know what the principle did"."yeah I know every single student in the school now has to take one extracurricular activity in the school year and it so unfair that we are force to do it too."You know Generic_Name the reason that I disagree with the principle is that I lose my time in and out of school also I think that we should choose if we should choose to do a extracurricular activity now my final reason is that some of these extracurricular activity I can not make to plus we were force to do it to."

My first main reason that I disagree with the principle is that I lose time. my first reason is that if one of the extracurricular activity after school then I can not do home work until later in the after noon also it be harder for me to get things done at home because I will have to do things at home like clean and other things so I would just lose more time. Another reason is that if it in the school day then I lose time to learn and it will be harder for me to to the work because it going to take more time to learn it because I will have to stay after school so I can under stand what I should have learned in school that day. My final reason is that the time you lose you cant get it back so the extracurricular activity makes it harder for people to get things done with other things in school plus after. If you are doing something after school already it going to be harder to mange your time and not waste it because you have the extracurricular activity to do and now you have to worry about other things at home and if your doing out of school sports or anythings else that could relate.

My second main reason that I disagree with the principle is that we should be able to choose if we want a extracurricular activity or not have it. One reason is that not every single student will cooperate and want to do the extracurricular activity and will most likely miss behave in that particular activity because they dont want to be there or they do not enjoy the activity and they were force to go and do it to. Another reason is that only a certain amount of people would like to have the extracurricular activities and others won't also people would like to chooses what type of activity that they would enjoy to do and would have the most fun in and not be board or miss behave. My final reason is that we should pick when the extracurricular activities because it would help and see what the students would have in common also we should have the right to picking what time they should be and what days they would occur on and what the topic we can choose to pick and see which of them are appropit.

My last and final reason that disagree with the principle with the forcing of the extracurricular activity is that we dont have time to do it. One reason that I would not be able to make it is because I have other things that occur after school like my soccer practice would have to choose to go to soccer or go to a extracurricular activity that I was force to do and did not get a choice that if I did not want to do it. another reason that I would not be able to make it to my extracurricular activity is that if it in school I would rather go to class then the extracurricular activity because class is more important and more of a grade then the extracurricular activity and I do not want to fail a class over something that I was force to do then if I chosen it. My final reason that I would not be able to go is that I was force to do something that I did not want to do so I would most likely skip it and go home or to class if it in school. Also if it had interest me maybe I would not skip but, it does not interest me at all and if I had a say in it and I would be in a extracurricular activity that I would feel better and would enjoy more.

"Hey Ian what you told me was right it is unfair for every one of the students to do a extra curricular activity that they were force into and did not have a say and did pick if they wanted it or not Also the reason that you listed were pretty valid and not just some thing you say that would be a lie."Generic_Name what I said was the truth it not pretty it is valid because why would you want too do something that you did not have a say in and not want to do too"."You know Generic_Name the reason that I disagree with the principle is that I lose my time in and out of school also I think that we should choose if we should choose to do a extracurricular activity now my final reason is that some of these extracurricular activity I can not make to plus we were force to do it to."
