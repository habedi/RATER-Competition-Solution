Dear Principal,

I think that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in school because if we allow students to have cell phones in school then they will be want to pay more attention to who they are texting, or calling. Another reason is that if they have cell phones they are never going to want to listen to what the teacher has to say. And they wont learn anything, and will not be able to graduate nor go to college.

Its a good thing that cell phones are not allowed during school because if they were the no one would know how to do anything or what it meant, because everyone would be to interested on what's going on around them instead of what is really important because you need our education to become successful.

That is why our principal should remain the policy of no cell phone use in school and that they should not consider letting students use them while school hours.
