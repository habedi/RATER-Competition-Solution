Hi! Thanks for reading by Artical! I hope you like it! In this artical i will sow you reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a very good program and you should join!

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a progam where you have to take horses ALL over the world. It could be France, Germany, or even Africa! I know some reasons that might get you to want to join the Seagoing Cowboys. First, you get to see many places! They can be very buitiful, or very nasty. The mystery is what i like about that reason. Second, you can help people in need, like people in africa need food and you can help them get it and you can help plant crops and ots of other stuff! Last, Just HORSES! Who doesn't like horses?! You can take care of them, and you can feed them, and you can pet them, and all sorts of stuff! You also get extra time and you can play games!

Thanks for coming all ths way! I hope you cn get time to read some more about this stuff. If you want to join this than YAY! If you don't want to join it, (No Comment) Lol thanks for readinng. See ya 'Round the sea!
