Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Video conference is when two or more people go online and contact each other through an app that allows them to see each other while talking. Additionally, with video conference people are allow to contact each other from long distances. Opponents incorrectly believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to them not having internet or having technology. Although some believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Being able to attend classes from home would benefit students. One reason it would benefit students is by catching up with their class on sick days. In other words, catching up on sick days is when someone is able to make up assignments or learning new information from online classes. For example, Generic_Name was home sick and decided to that he was not going to miss class today, so he got onto a computer and went to his teacher's website so he can learn today's lesson. By being able to access his teacher's lesson, he was able to learned new information and be able to complete any assignments that the teacher may have given him in class. Additionally, another reason that it can benefit students is by having a one on one conversation with their teacher. To elaborate, the student and teacher are able to talk to each other by themselves and have an understanding. For instance, Generic_Name decided to contact his teacher because he could not understand the lesson today. By doing this Generic_Name's teacher was able to break down the lesson much more easier for Generic_Name to understand it more and be able to remember the lesson. Furthermore, attending classes from home could benefit students is by having the lessons prerecorded. To illustrate, the teacher has a camera that records each lesson they have in class and post it to a website that students can access. By having the lessons prerecorded the students are able to access each lesson they missed and take notes that can benefit them later.

Being able to attend classes from home would benefit self. First reason from being able to attend classes from home is that they can go at their own learning place. To be specific, is that a student might learn at a different speed or level from other students. For example, Generic_Name was having difficulty trying to learn today's lesson, so after he got home he went back to the class website to see the lessons again. When Generic_Name went onto to look at the lesson again, he was able to slow it down at his learning level and get a better concept of it. Additionally, attending classes would benefit self is that the student could be parent and must stay with their kids. To illustrate, some college classes give out online classes for parents who cannot attend the college because of their children. For instance,

Generic_Name's mom was planning on getting her master degree so she signed up for an online college class due to her not being able to leave her kids home by themselves. Generic_Name's mom was able to stay home to watch over her children while she was getting an education at the same time. Furthermore, attending classes from home could benefit self is if the student have a learning disability. Learning disability is when someone is at a disadvantage of gaining knowledge or understanding whats being taught to them. To illustrate, Generic_Name have a learning disadvantage which causes the letters he see to switch around, so he uses the online classes to help him with his problem. WIth his disadvantage there could a teacher that deals with that type of disablilty and help Generic_Name learn the lessons his teacher are trying teach.

Even though many others may believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be understood that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. The opposition wrongly thinks that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because it will make the student antisocial and students might not have access to the lessons. However, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it benefits student so they can catch up on sick days, have prerecorded lessons, and have a one on one conversation with the teacher. Additionally, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is due to benefits to self because of learning disabilities, parents having kids and cannot attend class in person, and learning at their own pace. Schools should allow more online classes for days students miss school and are not able to attend. Also students can acccess the lessons anytime they want and be able to complete work on time.
