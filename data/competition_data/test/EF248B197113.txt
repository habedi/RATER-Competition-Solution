The auther supports the idea of study venus more because the chance of find out the history about venus and if it was a earth-like plant that was once home to life. In pargah 4 they say that "venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth," because of venus includes"familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."

As NASA work on a way to study venus and how to reach it. They have work with "some simplified electronics made slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface"that has lasted for 3 weeks.

As the auther states his last part by say thet "earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."

To sum it all up is that we should stop because we fail we should learn from it and keep push on.
