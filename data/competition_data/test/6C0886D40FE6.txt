My position on driverless cars is that there shouldnt really be driverless cars. If there are driverless cars think of how many more accidents there would be. There shouldnt be a car that can help you pull out of your drive way. The artical states that having driverless cars would be more efficant but what if its not what if there are more accidents in the US due to driverless cars then there is involving humans, it also states that it can help drive its self by accelerating itslef, braking, and steering. Humans need to be alert when behind the wheel. Driverless cars takes that away.

The automotive companies really need to think this desicion more thouroghly, because yes they would be making alot more money by coustomers buying the driverless cars but if the cars truly arent driverless like the artical says then one persokn is gonna think that its okay to fall asleep or something else and then BAM!! You have gotten in an accident and whos fault is it? Its your fault not the cars fault.

Yes driverless cars help with paying more attention but that should not be a reason to just do whatever you want behind the wheel because you thing its safe. The artical states that the BMW auto motive company had announced the development of " Traffic Jam Assistant" the car can only handle driving functions up to 25 miles per hour what will happen if an accident occurs of that speed limit?

Driverless cars should not be a legal thing there is too many things that could go wrong and too many lifes at stake. Should driverless cars be banned? Yes, or, No you decide.
