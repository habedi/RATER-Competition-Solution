To support the authors details,I'm going to use details from this passage. The author thinks that Venus is worthy to pursuit, despite the dangers. Here is one detail from the passage that supports this. "Often referred to as Earth's "twin,"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size." But it would be very challegning only because the conditions on Venus are very rough and must be elevated off the ground at most 30 miles above the ground to get a good look. Plus more details from the passage say "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets surface, tempatures average over 800 degrees. Despite all those dangers I think it is very possible to get a better look at the beautiful planet that we live next to! heres a quote to show that nasa doesn't let little things get in the way."Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imgination and innovation.
