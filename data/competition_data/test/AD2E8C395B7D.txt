You may think it was created by aliens, but can you really support that?

From what scientists have researched, they found many evidence to support their conclusion.

Some people do think it is the work of aliens, but many people have more resonable explanations.

That they can support from evidence they have either seen, watched, or heard about, that make it a valid explanation.

First off, scientists thought it could possible be just another Martian mesa, because they were common around Cydonia.

Most of all they wouldn't send pictures and information out to the public without being possitive about their discoveries.

Escpecialy if they knew how big of a pop icon it would turn out to be.

It has starred in Hollywood fils, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a huanted grocery store checkout line for 25 years.

I do however understand your resoning for thinking it was created by alliens because...

Even though Martian mesa's were common in Cydonia, this one had a unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Many people also thought the allien marking were hidden, because of haze.

Sense it was a cloudy time of the year for the Red Planet.

In the end the scientist concluded that it really was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

Butte and Mesas are also very common around the American West.

Garvin says "It reminds me most of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."

"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"
