Dear,

TEACHER_NAME

I think students should be required to perform community service, because it is very nice and considerate. Students would learn many things about helping people and they would learn about being an adult. When people perform community service it would keep them out of trouble and when they become adults they wont get into any trouble. Performing community service would make a person happy as well as yourself. Community service should be an elective at many schools and be required to graduate, so they can learn maturity when they enter high school and college.

Community service should be required because it helps high school students and junior high students gain maturity. It is very important because maturity determines what kind of student you are and what kind of adult you will be when you get older. Many students who do not have maturity and are often the ones that get into trouble. Community service helps you can maturity and get students out of trouble, because they would not like to distract any one from learning. Community service as an elective would be a good idea because they would like to help people and would care about others.
