Seagoing Cowboys program is a once in a life time oppertunity. You get to be with animals, get to ride in a boat, and also get to see many archetectial designs, such as the Great Wall of China or the Eiffel Tower. If you ever get the chance to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program, I suggest that you do.

Seagoing Cowboys lets you stay with animals when you ride in the boat. When I was working, I got to work with animals such as horses and cattle. There are many animals to work with. There are also many things that you must do for the animals. You must feed them, water them, and clean out their stalls. The animals usually eat oats or wheat. Animals can be hard work, but they can also give you something fun to do.

Seagoing Cowboys program is all by sea. You pick up the animals on land and then, you set sail and hit the water. If you have never ridden in a boat, then I suggest that you take this oppertunity in life. Boats can be very fun. They rock back and forth like a rocking chair and float on water. Boats are proably the most important thing that we need for the journey. If we did not have the boats, then we are out of luck.

If you have never seen any national landmark, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to try to see a landmark. On the trips I have taken, I have gotten to see the Acropolis, parts of China, and have done and seen many other things. One of my favorites was riding in a gondola, in the city of water, Venice. The landmarks are important because they remind us of friendship. For example, France gave us the Effiel Tower to us as a peace treaty? Well, now you know.

The Seagoing Cowboy program lets you be with animals, get to ride on a boat, and gives you the oppertunity to see national landmarks like the Great Wall of China. So know that you know more about the Seagoing Cowboy program and what you do, think about signing up at the age of 18 to participate.
