Considering the fact that more often than not, students get bored in the classroom at least a few times. If their computer had the ability to tell when they are bored, then it can find something that the students enjoy. Paragraph six states that if " 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused of bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' " When we get bored in class a good teacher can usually tell. some teachers will try to make class more intersting for the student. The more interesting it is, the more you are likely to learn. But if you're on the computer, the computer will automatically know when you're bored. Teachers don't always know just by you're face because that might not be something they were supposed to learn. Plus computers would most likely have more resources to provide something interesting for you. Teachers might not always have that at hand. Paragraph six also says " 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too." We already have phones and computers that we can talk to and they know what to do, some smartphones even talk back to you. But they can't read our emotions. They don't know what we need unless we say it. Making computers be able to calculate our emotions could make things easier, for students, for teachers,and for anyone who needs this kind of technology. "So, who really thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions? " Paragraph nine.
