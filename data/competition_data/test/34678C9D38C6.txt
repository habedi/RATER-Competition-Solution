The face was not created by aliens because there is still no proof that aliens or any living thing that lives on mars NASA are still looking for life on mars so how can the face be made by mars. It was formed by shadows giving the illusion of a human head, eyes, nose and mouth. There was no alien monument after all. The face was just made up with clouds and dust particles from Mars. What the picture actaully show is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common aroung the American West.

The picture saying that the aliens created the face is just clouds forming a face on a stormy day on Mars beacuse our eyes can be illusion of what we see. The face was made up of dust and clouds which formed a face. tThe picture that was taken in 1976 looks like a face but doesnt have all thee features as the picture that was taken in 1998. The pictue that was taken in 1998 looks very simlar like a face u can see eyes, mouth, a nose. The picture that was taken in 2001 doesnt look like a face anymore looks like dryed up dirt.
