Despite the risks that Venus poses, the extreme planet is very intimidating in terms of exploration and data collection. In the passage, the author supports the idea well by backing up his claim with real situations that have been close to discovering the climate, geography and other data about this unknown planet. Without being able to know a lot about Venus, the author can make supported claims with the information that has been found about the planet up to this point.

Throughout the article, the author gives certain statistics about Venus and the extremities of the planet. Along with giving the data, the author also seems to ask the reader what the point of exploring Venus even is. With that, he then explains why, even through the harsh conditions, scientists continue to study the planet. He then gives examples of new ways that have been found to study the different things about Venus; showing the reader that he is supporting his claim as to how the planet could be studied even with the extremities of the climate and geography.

While giving different statistics and data, the author raps the article up by saying that the travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts and should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. With this being said, the reader can clearly see that the author is still supporting his claim with the exception of the technology being absent to conduct studies that could land human exploration on another planet.
