The conspiracy about there being life on the moon in this article is not correct. For someone to claim there is life anywhere but the planet Earth needs to provide evidence. Providing evidence is not just having a theory with people backing you up. Evidence is providing proof, proof is pictures lab tests and finding all possiblities that that is the only thing it could be. The article however cannot provide proof or hardly any evidence there are living things on Mars.

The article does provide a picture, but the picture is nothing but a mear misunderstanding. The picture provided is what is called a lava dome, simply shapes creating the form of a face. People like to take little things and make them into something just because they can. Many people are making a large amount of money off of this discovery and that's what people are after now, people care about money and publisity. This scientific breakthrough is nothing but a scam really.

People want to believe what they hear and so most of the time they will. Things can be photoshopped now a days with all the new technology so I suppose you can never know for sure. New discoveries are scary and scientists will keep on discovering the world and even whats outside of our world but there's no gaurentee this is a real ailen artifact. Things form together and make random shapes, this shape on Mars just so happened to be a face, big deal that doesn't mean anything. The image might also be slightly blurred, purhaps taken at an angle at which forms it into a face. Angle is everuthing, angle can make something look like it actually isn't, it plays tricks on your mind and your eyes.

Maybe this is a mark left by an ailen and if so scientists are ready to let out all the truth because the public isnt ready for something new, something unheard of. The only thing the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or a mesa, landforms common around the american west, does this mean aliens are also on our planet? I think not. There is no life on Mars proven what so ever and all that this picture is is a misshaped landform misrepresented. The picture provided is nothing more then a shape that people are claiming is an alien artifact but in the end there still isn't enough evidence to support that claim.
