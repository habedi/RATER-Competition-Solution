"I have a accomplished so much by taking extracurricular activities." said Generic_Name, a student at Generic_School. She believes that extracurricular activities can help out with many things in and outside of school, I agree. Students should participate in them because one can make friends, and it is better than being alone indoors all day. Although, some will say that students might get behind with their priorities.

To begin, in most activities kids will become friends with the other students there. Usually students will start by getting to know each other first. This would be by talking to each other to know who they will be with for the rest of the season/year. Next, as time goes people will start creating bonds and growing relationships with their peers. Friendships that become really close are always something special and should last forever. Once people start becoming friends they might choose to hangout and be together. This adds to the list of things to do when bored, hanging out with friends. Having and making friends is something important, extracurricular's will help with that.

Second, when participating in extracurricular activities it is better than staying inside all day. Most of the time activities are going to require you to interact with new people. Students can get to see the world and a lot of the time, learn new things. If the students' activity is a sport then they will probably be outside. This is good because they will need the fresh air at some point. Most teens nowadays are always inside playing video games. Finally, one will expand their knowledge to more that just school and home. This way their path will not be going from home to school then back. Getting to go outside has many positives that come with it, and it happens because of the activities.

Some may say that if students take part in extracurricular activities they will get behind on their priorities. This may include homework, chores, and anything else. If they are so busy out and about when will they have time? If that is the case the student can choose an activity that will help them. Some options include homework clubs, or AVID. They are meant to help students out in school. It would be an opportunity to further and better themselves.

Students should take part in at least one extracurricular activity. One can make friends, and it is better than being alone and indoors. In addition students can find an activity to better their education. Extracurricular activities have helped me as well.
