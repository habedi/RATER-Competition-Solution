Space is an interesting and confusing large mass of black with so much in it to explore. Who wouldn't want the opportunity to explore it? The author of

"The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is very for the exploration of Venus. Venus is a planet in our solar system. It is sometimes called the evening star because it is one of the brightest points in the night sky or it is called Earth's twin due to similarity in density and size. We also dont know much about Venus because it is very dangerous due to very hot temperatures and many other things. But exploring it would be very worth it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents beacause human curiosity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors, we could get more insight about Venus, and our travels on Earth, and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts.

One reason that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is beacuse human curiousity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Who knows, human curiousity and advancing in technology could lead us to any other planet in our solar system. The more we know about life the more we can explore. In the story it says, " These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus." If we explore Venus we can most definitely explore Mars as well.

Another reason that studying Venus is worthy is beacuse we can get more insight about Venus. We need more information about Venus because it is Earth's sister planet. The more we understand Venus the easier it will be to understand space. In the text it says, " If our sister planet is so inhospititable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface" This could possibly mean we could live on Venus someday. That would be a major benefit if anything ever happened to Earth.

The third reson that studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers is because our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubt. If we don't explore there is no explanations to peoples questions. Everyday we risk our lives because we never know what can happen. We shouldn't limit our decisions and our exploration based on fear. In the text it says " just as ariplanes travel at a high altitude" which means that it wouldnt be anything super unsafe to hover above Venus so why not try and do it.

In conclusion, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

If we explored it human curiousity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors, we could learn more about venus, and our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by our dangers and doubts. Venus is a planet that is very close and similar to Earth why should we not explore it?

So much good would come out of the exploration of Venus. The danger of anything shouldn't stop people from exploring.
