Have yo ever wondered what it would be like without a car in America or anywhere else? well im going to give you a little on how it feels not to have a car.

First, Vauban Germany- Residents which they are an upscale community which they are suburban pioneers with just a few soccer moms or commuting executives. French and Swiss borders streets are " car-free" except the main thoroughfare, where Freiburg runs. Owners must get a larger garage or the must park on a large edge which can lead up form $40,000 just right along with a home. As the results came in 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own a car and most of them like 57 percent sold their cars in order to move where they was from to be down in Vauban's. As Heidrun Walter say " I'm much happier this way" she is just a mother of two and she walks right along verdant streets where the swish of the biycles and the children and adults chattering instead of hearing a loud motor coming up and down the streets where her and two children walk on.

Next, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. They enforced this law on a Monday for even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a big fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates on that following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and according to the Reuters about twenty-seven people had their car impunded due to they got into a phyiscal altercation with the police officers when they was handing them their tickets or they wouldnt comply to the rules that they had made so that they could clear the air. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to about 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to the Reuters. The smog cleared enought Monday for the ruling French party to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on a tuesday with the complaintes from delivery companies for the lost of revenue, while they didnt expect to have a hyrbid cars with only carrying three or more passaengers at that time.

Finally, Bogota, Colombia a capital city where during most days they hiked, biked, skated or even took buses to work during a car-free day like yesterday, leaving their cars on the streets nearly devoided a traffic jam on the side of that street. Just being it's third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Days Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogotoa. " The rain hasnt stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Carlos Arturo Plaze and his wife have rode a two-seat bicycle so that they can help stop the smog. In the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily which lead to that most of Americans either dont have jobs in order to pay to get a new car or that people with jobs either brought cheaper cars which held aleast amount of gas. There was a drop in the percentage of 16-to-39-year-olds getting their license, while most of the older genertation just retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found.

In Conclusion, Having cars in certain places is a dangerment not only to that city or state but to their people and the air pollution which can lead to way more dangerous things.       Â
