In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", author Nick D'Alto talks about the Facial Action Coding System, a new technology enabling computers to identify human emotions. In paragraph six he briefly talks about how it could work in a classroom setting and I believe that this would be a great new idea to bring into the school systems.

In "Making Mona Lisa Smile", Nick D'Alto starts explaining the Facial Action Ciding System by talking about all of it's potential, like how it can recognize even subtle facial movements and how it works will all 44 major muscles in our face. He then talks about all the places where this softwear would be useful like being able to tell if someone , like an important politician, is tellikg the truth or not.

Although he only brings the subject up once, he talks about how in a school setting this softwear would be increadibly uesful to help teach students more by knowing when they are confussed or borded. If teachers had access to infromation like this they would know when a leason is becoming too much for their students and be able to move on or explain it better. I think that this would be one of the most efficient ways to learn properly in school.

Let say a student has been out of it and sudenly realizes he has no idea whats going on during an important leason in his english class, but he doesn't want to say anything to his teacher because he's afraed he'll get in trubble, or maybe he's just to lazy to ask. That student won't have any idea of what to do for the rest of class. If schools had the Facial Action Coding System then the teacher would know right away that the student had not been paying attention and would be able to go back and explain again.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to the learning world. Students would never again have to sit through a class and have no idea what was going on because before they got too confused the system would let the teacher know.
