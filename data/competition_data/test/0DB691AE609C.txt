What i think about using it on students. I think thats they should use it but i also think they should't. Why i think they should use it is because what if something illegal has taken place and someone dont want to say. Then the teacher can tell that the kid knows something but dont want to say what it is. i also think it would be a good/cool thing to show the students. Some classes teach you about tecnology so i think it would be helpful and a good example to show around. Aloso i think that it would be helpful to social studies to because thrn you could use it to see war pictures and see how the people in the pictures were feeling at that time.

Why i think we should not use them for students. I think that if we used them on student it would invade there privacies. I think that some kids would feel more safe if people did not know how they felt. I know that if someone used that michine on me i kinda mad but not that mad because i would think it was kinda cool. there are some pros and cons to the michine that i think would invade some peoples lives that would make then feel uncomfortable to ettend school. in my opinion i think that they should have them in school for school related things not for persanal reasons. and i also think that it would be a cool thing to use if u went to a musium or use them for old pictures you could use them on old family pictures to see how your ansesters felt during that picture. I honestly think it would be a good idea to have them in school for school related reasons but could be used for persanal reasons if the teacher or owner of the device says you can use it for them reasons.
