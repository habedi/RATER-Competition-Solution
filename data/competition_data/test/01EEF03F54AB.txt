The author made many good points into why reseaching Venus is a worth while pursuit. One of the reasons he says is that Venus in some ways is like Earth, in that size and density are the same on both planets.

Though there are many dangers going into the research of Venus, there also are some posibilities. Long ago Venus may have been like Earth, oceans could have been formed suporting sea and other life, and providing water for life forms that may have lived there. Venus has rocks, mountains, valley's, and volcanoes, just like Earth has today.

Since there are many dangers with the studying of Venus scientists at NASA are working on ways to make studying Venus safer and easier. Since the temperature at Venus is usually around 800 degrees, scientists might be using a blimp like vehicle to hover the surface of Venus. Since radiaton on Earth is the same to that on venus' and solar power would be abundant, though life for humans would be hard, conditions could soon be survivable.

Though hovering Venus safely can give a good insite to what the planet holds. It still only gives us limited access to what Venus may have. Pictures and videos are very helpful, but things like rock's, gasses, and anything else Venus has cannot be collected.

Technology has come a long way in helping study Venus, computers today are faster, more powerful, and flexible. Computers today help is detect dangers, and they tend to know the physical conditions that we can take, sometimes more than we could. Machines today can help us make our materials more resistant to the dangers of Venus, and they also help us by using algorithms to discover more safe ways of studying Venus.

The studying of Venus could be helpful, not only by conquering the challenges Venus provides us with, but by also learning about the planet in itself. Dangers should not be the thing that holds humans back from research, but it is curiosity that might be the thing that leads us to conquering more challenges that we face by danger.
