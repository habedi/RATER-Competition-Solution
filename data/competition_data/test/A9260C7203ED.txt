Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home, so students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because school are not safe enough.

I think that students would benefit from being able to take online classes because schools are not able to protect students. Schools does not have enough security guards, and there is only one police officer in the whole school. Also the security recording system has a bad video recording quality and it is are not well located. For example someone stole my friends phone from her backpack, and some of the cameras recorded it, but you can not see who stole it because of the bad video quality.

Another reason I think students would benefit from online classes is because they will develop technological skills. Technological skills are very important now days, Most likely they are necessary to get a job or just in your everyday life.

Some say that normal classes are the best for student; however, I believe that online classes are better.

In conclusion, online classes are the best option because students develop technological skills, and schools are not safe enough.
