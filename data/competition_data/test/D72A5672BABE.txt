I like the idea of technology that can read emotions. It could be used at police staitions and other places. We could use it for lie detecters and more things in that catogory. It sounds really expencive and confusing.

Why do we need a computer trying to figure out our emotions. Its amazing dont get me wrong. Like if you wanted to see if someone was or is holding back a smile you could see it. Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% discustied, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Thats nice to know how a person feels or felt during a photo.

I would use the device on my own picture. Why does it have to make a 3D printing of your face to be able to read your emoitons. Could we use it on multipul faces in one picture? It would be really neat if it could capture three or move faces in one.

I didn't know da Vinchi studied the anatomy. That was probably why he could paint the body so well. The Mona Lisa is supposed to make you smile and i didn't know that. This device is able to see if a polition is liying. Think of how many other things it could do if it was upgraded.

In conclusion i like the new technology. I feel it needs a lil more upgrading before giving it to the public. Its a great device. I would like to see this device do what it does best.
