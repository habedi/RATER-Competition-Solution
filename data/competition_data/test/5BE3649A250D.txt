Dear Principal,

I think that the school should allow policy 1. Every student should be allowed to bring their cell phone to school.

One reason i think policy 1 should be chosen is because the students could use their cell phone during lunch. The student can also use his/her phone when they have free time during class as long as they have permission from the teacher. The student should also have their phone off during class when the teacher is teaching so they wont get distracted.

Another reason policy 1 should be chosen is because we should be able to bring our phones as long as were learning. If were still learning and paying attention in class there's no need to take our phones away.

Those were reasons why i want you to choose policy 1. It may seem like a bad decision but, it could turn out good as long as the students follow this policy.
