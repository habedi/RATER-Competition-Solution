The Challenge of Exploring Venus

Imagine living on a dangerous but not so dangerous planet, would you risk your life on the sake of science? Venus could be a groundbreaking science exploration but is dangerous. The author makes claims suggesting Venus is dangerous but it is worth it. "Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans". Which I agree with the author.

The author talks about how "no spaceship has landed there in three decades" but,"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life". The fact that Venus could've had life could help us find out if other life forms live within us, that seems worthy enough. Although the temperatures do average over 800 degrees fahrenheit scientists can float above the fray. The temperature can get at 170 degrees which is survivable for us humans. "Erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface". Weather conditions may be dangerous but humans will not land on its surface.

The "atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we face on our own planet". Like I said they won't send their astronaunts onto the surface but they will be sent on the fray and will be more secure on the fray. "Not one spacecraft last a few hours". As the years go up our technology gets more sufficient and becomes safer, so scientists will be able to make a spacecraft that is able to land on Venus. "The clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere", astronaunts and scientists will stay on the fray.

I added seven different dangerous facts about venus and all of them were answered by scientists suggesting that Venus is safe for astronaunts to go. I stand with the author which is Venus is dangerous but it is a worthy pursuit. Letting astronaunts goto Venus would be groundbreaking and yes it is safe for astroanaunts to goto.
