I have two different opinions on cell phones during school. To preface them, I want to begin with saying that cell phone usage, as a whole, is of little importance. Teachers seem to be reluctant to enforce the current policies we have, as cell phones do not distract most students, especially if set to vibrate and not ring. And most students have enough control to not use them during a time of importance, like when taking a test. And no student will ever give up their usage of cell phones during class, so long there is a way to use them during class, even if it's against rules.

Both policies have their merit, but I believe Policy 1 would provoke less outrage from students. Not all students have free time at the same time as others. For example, when I'm in my lunch period, which is period 5, somebody else may be in their math class. This matters because I can possibly interrupt his thought during an assignment. Also, students will not turn their phones off unless punishment is severe, and teachers are actively looking out for students using cell phones. Policy 2 would also be fine, with the exception that students will probably be annoyed with the principal, or the Board of Education, or whoever promotes and declares this new policy. To work, Policy 2 would also have to be enforced well. However, students would likely resent Policy 2 more. It's restricting, especially when it pops into place so suddenly. Sudden, harsh change isn't favored by anybody. Even parents may be involved with making Policy 2 controversial within the town, as some feel the need to keep in touch with their child during school, especially after certain security issues happening at them, such as pipe bombs, smoke bombs, and guns being brought and used at some schools throughout the country.

Policy 1 is the better policy, but in the greater picture, a problem posed by something so miniscule as a cell phone doesn't matter. Thus, I'm indifferent to anything regarding cell phones. I do admit to using mine sometimes during class, but I have enough self control to not turn it into a problem. However, if one is to go about changing the policy on cell phones, it'd have to be enforced well to work. This is where the boundaries of teaching and babysitting students blend. If cell phones are that much of a problem to the staff, then teachers likely aren't teaching because they're being told by their superiors to make cell phones a priority. When a teacher is actively looking for people that are using their cell phones during class, chewing gum, not wearing a school ID, etc., they ultimately aren't doing their job, and that is what truly matters.
