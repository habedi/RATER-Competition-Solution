Sure technology is great but, can we really trust it? Self driving cars are quickly approaching, so before they are here we must go over the negative aspects it will have. My stance on self driving cars is, they are unsafe and not perfectly created

A few problems we might encounter with a self driving car is, problems with the law, and technology issues/malfunction.

The law states that its main focus is keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Laws assume the only safe way to acheive that is with alert drivers. How can we trust a robot to drive a vehicle, with no real thought process? What if they malfunction and someone gets injured, then we have discuss whos liable and its a big ordeal. The text states " New laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident." The main message is who is liable for a mistake in the cars accident? The driver or the manufacturer?

Secondly, Computer malfunction and technology issues have been occuring since the dawn of computers. So, whos to say it wont happen to a car? Smart cars are relished to be great and accident free but in the case of an electronic malfunction, I beg to differ. Also, are hackers able to tune into your car and mess it up electronically? YES! By bypassing your cars security system, they will have full access to your car from the inside, and be able to shut it down or cut off certain features. So the smartest move is to stick with manually driven cars for the safety and concern of our people. But they are currently working on these issues as stated " Automakers are continuing their work on the assuption that the problems ahead will be solved."

Smart cars may be a new intuitive way to drive a car, but they need to be more harshly critisized for the safety of young children and adults. Sure smart cars can be safe and effective but they MUST be one-hundred percent proven and out of technological disorder for the maximum protention of our countries people.
