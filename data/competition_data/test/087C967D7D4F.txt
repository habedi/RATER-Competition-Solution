Thomas Huang has created an software that can recongnize your emotions from an computer and I dont think its a good or bad idea. Here are some why its not valuable.

People shouldnt always know how others feel. They shouldnt have to be worried about if a computer knows there sad or not. Most students come to class to get away from there emotions so why would you bring them back up?

Although this computer could be valuable in some ways like helping your friend feel happy. As they said in the passage " it could recognize when a student is becoming confused and bored" which would get them back on track. It also modifies the lesson for you. Making it easier on the person that is on the computer.

So is the emtional expressions of students in a classroom valuable? I would have to save thats all up to you. Some people would like others knowing if they are sad or not. Personally I woud not like them knowing I was sad all the time.
