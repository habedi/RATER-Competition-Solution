Dear Ms.(Name of Principal),

I have noticed that you have started thinking about cell phone policies. I probably would too at a time like this when cell phone numbers increase by the day. I read your two policies that you have now and I think I have my decision as well. Though I do not agree with one other automatically.

I have read the policies/ideas that you have came up with for taking care of the cell phone distraction that's been increasing the last few years. I have an idea though and it ties up with Policy 1; follow those rules and when a student is caught, have stricter consequences for their actions. For they would be allowed to have their cell phone out during lunch and that is plenty of time for a teenager to use a phone am I correct? I mean lunch is about a little over 30 minutes and students should have their phone turned off when lunch is over. I have some suggestions for the consequences if a student is caught with one on during class.

-Give the Student Lunch Detention and take away phone for the parent to get

-ISS if a student is caught texting and phone is taken away by teacher and given back at the end of the day

-Give the Student after school if a student is caught talking on the phone before or during class

(these are just suggestions I roughly thought up.)

Only let the teenagers be allowed to have cell phones out during lunch and at other times when class is not in session. At the end of day during their flex they should be allowed to have them out no other times are they permitted to be using them unless its Lunch of Flex. Other times if they have them out, give them stricter punishments each time they are caught are even caught at all for the first time.

I agree with your Policy 1 and I believe that should take effect for all the Teenagers with cell phones. You just need more punishments for if they are caught with them. That is all I have and I hope you take it into consideration for stepping up the punishment for this new thing I call the Cellphone War...
