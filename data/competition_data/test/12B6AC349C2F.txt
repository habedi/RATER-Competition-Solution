A lot of people agree that limiting car usage is a great idea. it can help reduce stress. it will decrease all of the pollution in the air so we can live safer.

With the limitation of car usage it will help pollution all around the world decrease. This will be very useful because we wouldn't need to worry about global warming as much. With less pollution the next generation will be able to live safer knowing there air is not filled with dangerous toxins. This limitation will extremely benefit heavily polluted areas to limit the pollution and probably have the people live longer.

This limitation will also help reduce stress. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"  says Heidrum walter. This goes to prove that without a car you dont need to worry about car related problems like car jams getting in your way of being late. It will also reduce stress by you dont need to worry everday not to get into a car crash and possibly lose your life.

With the limitation money can be saved. If you dont have a car you dont nedd to pay insurance. Without a car you dont have to pay for gas and that money can be used on other things. Some places fine people just for driving, so not driving would benefit.

As you can see this car limitation can benefit us a lot of way. Saving money, reducing stress, and air pollution is just a couple of great things.
