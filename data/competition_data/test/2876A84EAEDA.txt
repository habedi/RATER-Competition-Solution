New ideas, and smart engineering has been making it possible and eaiser to do many thngs. With cuttuing edge technology and knowledge evolving, humans have been acheiving and setting for the unthinkable. From cars traveling faster than the speed of sound, to cars that can drive themselves. Some aren't to happy with the image of that. Think, can cars really drive on their own, and what if the cars crashes who's at fault?

The idea of self driving cars scare many that maybe why it's actually illegal to even test computer-driven cars, stated in passage 9. This is because it isn't a hundred percent safe, though Google has cars that have been driven for a million miles without a crash, stated in passage 2. I think it would make a big change if cars could drive themselves. There would probably still be car accidents, but there would be as many.

Self driving cars would have many pros because there could be less texting and driving, which means less accidents. There would also be less drunk drivers which mean leass accidents, and there could also be less people dying. This would be a deal breaker for parents they could actuallly monator where their kids go. There could be less accidents among teens and in general. Kids wouldn't have to lose their life because they ran out in the street and was hitten by a car all because the child was getthing a ball.

I think that by the year 2022 that cars will be on the market And would help and save many people. "Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time." Its better that it's 90 percent safety than 20 because nothing can ever be perfect but we can always try to be as close to it as we can.
