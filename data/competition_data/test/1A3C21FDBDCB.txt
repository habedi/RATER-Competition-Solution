Dear Principal,

I am writing you this letter to let you know that i think it is a wonderful idea to encourage students to perform community service. This is a good idea because it teaches students to help others, makes them more responsible, and encourages others to do it to.

If all students did at least one hour of community service they would do something nice for other people, and maybe they would want to do it more often. So if they actually did do it at least once a week it would grow on them and they would have the satisfaction in doing something nice for there community. This will help them grow and feel good about themselves, this will also let them know that they are doing something that is really helping someone who needs it.

Since most students now don't really have the responsibility that they should this would really give them some. When doing a job for some one it always has to be done the right way. This will give the students a sense of caring about how there work turns out, and will most likely happen in school. Maybe then students will take up responsibility that will really help them with school and at home.

It happens with every child, monkey see monkey do, children see some one doing something and automatically they want to do it to. But what if they all saw they're peers doing something good, helpful, and productive. They would all want to do the same.

In conclusion i believe that all students should have to do at least an hour of community service once a week. Other people could really benefit from this, and they will to, it's good to know that your work pays off in helping out. This will teach students to help others, make them more responsible, and encourage others to do it to.
