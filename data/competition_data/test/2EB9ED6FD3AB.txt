Phones & Driving

In my honest opinion about phone's and driving they do not go together at because both you have to use full attention on when using especially with how things are now and days. It's really dangerous when doing it driving a car because cars are this big built mobile that if you get into a crash and risk your life and or money for insurance on it. Now I think you could balance it between Phone and driving if your good at that like at a red light maybe take a quick glance and it see what it is and then back to driving or get a car that can pick up phone calls.

Now with phones people are so attracted to phones now they can't even walk straight without bumping into people now is it bad to use phones no I don't think it is but when driving is a different story you are putting your life a risk with using a phone. You are putting other peoples life's at risk with doing that too.

When it comes to cars you need your full attention when driving a car everything needs to be sharp because there is dangerous things everywhere so you need to be aware of that when driving so that nothing bad happens. You can't do that when you're on a phone because you're taking away your senses from driving.

I don't think it is a good idea at all to do it unless you know what you're doing and have a car that can pick up phone calls and does not take your time away from driving on the road and therefore can keep you safe and everyone else around and get to your destination safely.
