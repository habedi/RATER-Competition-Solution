It is illegal to text and drive. Some people think it is okay to text and drive. However, there also is a group of people who feel that texting and driving shouldn't be allowed at all. Some people feel that if you know what you are doing that you should be able to text and drive. I personally feel as if texting and driving is okay. To an extent, some people should be allowed to text and drive.

To start off, I personally feel that texting and driving is okay. Part of me feeling that way is because I am a minor and always have my phone with me. Another reason why I feel that texting and driving is okay is because people make phones seem like they are the worst creation to exist when they actually have made positive impacts on societies. What if someone you care about is in an emergency? They could send you their location and you can go to help them.

Using your phone when you drive isn't as bad as it seems. That is if you you're mature enough to use your phone behind the wheel.

What I mean by being mature behind the wheel is that you shouldn't be texting on your phone is traffic is bad and stop signs are off. You shouldn't text and drive when you're

Getting a text saying "Are you going to the party on Friday?" However, if you come up to a red light and you get an important text, that would be fine to text back. Another reason that texting and driving is okay is that if need directions somewhere you can have someone text you for directions. People today use their phones for a gps. Some people aren't from the area they're in so they need directions. Me personally I use my phone for a gps when driving in an area I'm not familiar with because im not going to get lost and wind up somewhere I shouldn't be.

As good is texting and driving is for some people, it is also just as bad. Texting and driving can lead to car accidents. If you're texting and looking down at the road and there's someone reckless who runs their red light and crashes into you. Now your in an accident u probably could have avoided because you were looking at your phone. However, some gps apps help you avoid things ahead. Also if you feel as if someone is following you and you know your near a friend's house, you can let them know your being followed and your coming to their house and they need to come out to make sure you're okay. Texting and driving can help you avoid situations that you wouldn't be able to avoid if you didn't have a phone.

In conclusion, texting a driving isn't always a bad thing. You just have to know how to be responsible if you do it. You can't text someone when a traffic light is off. Next thing you know you'll end up getting hit.
