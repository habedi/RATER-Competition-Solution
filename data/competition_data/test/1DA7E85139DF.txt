May 24,2001 the face on Mars was not made by aliens. NASA thought they saw aleins land on mars and creat the face. This is a mission to find how it was made and who it was made by.

A few days later NASA showed the picture for everyody to see. Authors reasponed it would be a good way to engage the public adn attarct go Mars and it certainly did. The "Face on Mars" has since become a pop icon. It was on books and magazines, raido talk shows and haunted grocey store checkout line for 25 years. Mission controllers perpared to look againg at the Mars. One summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew a close enough for a second look. We had to roll a space craft 25 defress to center the Face in the field of view said Garvin.

This is what is think about the face on Mars. That's a lava dome thta takes the form of an islolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars. This is what I think about the Face on Mars today.
