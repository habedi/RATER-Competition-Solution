Yes, I do think that we should use the Facial Action Coding in classroom. The reason why I say yes is because students do get bored and frustrated when doing notes or homework and even inclass work. The Facial Action Coding would allow the teachers to really see how or what there students emotions when it comes to doing there work, the teacher can change things up to making the class fun when they are doing note or work. Also the teacher can understand what's going on with his or her students in the classroom to see if they are struggling or if they get on how to do the work. I think math teachers would really would like to have this because, they would be able to tell if the students are lying to them on if they get it or if they don't get it. So the teacher would be able to help the students more that are struggling with the work. Also other classes than just math the teachers would be able to use it for helping there students in class that are actually not getting on how to do the work or if they do or don't understand the note. Like in a history class alot of time it can be very confusing and the students don't understand on how to do the teacher would be able to know if they really get it or they are just lying straight to there faces. The teachers would also know if they are having a good or a bad day, if they student is having a bad day they could some how cheer them up to make them happier in there class or the rest of the day.
