Dear Principal,

I believe Community Service should never be something that is forced upon students or anyone. It is meant to be volunteer work, children who enjoy it should be the only ones doing it, and children who are forced probably wont want to do it to begin with and their help wont actually be helping anyone.

Community service was designed for a volunteer help if the students are forced it would defeat the purpose of what the service really is. When someone is forced to do something there may not be room for those who are actually interested in helping someone in need or cleaning up the streets. Especially when it comes to helping elderly you don't want some kid who doesn't even know how to take care of himself to have the life of an elderly person in their hands.

Also, when a child wants to do community service to help out others they might not be able to if there are already so many people doing it when it is required for school. Kids who are not having a good time doing it are going to take up the space for someone who actually does. The actual work being done may not be done with the amount of skill or love that someone who enjoys it will have, like cooking.

It is commonly known that, when a child is being required to help someone or clean up garbage they are going to be very frustrated, leading to a worse done job. On the other hand when you have a happy free spirited child who just wants to help people his/her work will be much, much better than the frustrated kid who would rather be home sleeping, than be out working. also there are criminals who are forced to do this as well and they do a similar thing, so the evidence shows.

In conclusion, children, or anyone who actually want to be helping, should be the ones helping. It is meant to be set up like this, A kid who doesn't want to do it shouldn't be doing it, and Children who are forced will do a worse job on the service itself. This is why I advise you not to force children into volunteering for foundations they don't even want to be a part of.

Thanks,

Concerned Student
