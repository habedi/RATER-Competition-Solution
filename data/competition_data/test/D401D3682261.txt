Dear Principle ,

I think that students should be required to perform community service because if we can make a change in the world we should do it or atleast try because if one person makes a change so will others. Like for example littering people don't realize they are destroying the nature by throwing garbage all over and it doesn't look good if you are trying to enjoy yourself in a park with garbage all over so we should try to pick up trash all over and serve our community and make the world a better looking place.

Community service doesn't always have to be boaring or a waste of time because it could also be fun like you can shovel snow, or Babysit u can just take a time when you are not doing nothing and go out and better the world. Although u may not realize but by helping the community you are making yourself look good and also your community. You make people feel better about where they live and u can also put smiles on peoples face's and it will make u feel proud. Although community service is free you do it to better your community and everything you do will help you in the long run whether it makes u a better person or whether it helps you achieve great standards.

This is why students should have to do community service because it will help us achieve, and the world to succeed. This is our world and lets make it a better one for our futures generation. We can all make a change.
