My postition on drivless cars is that i personaly dont like the idea because what happens if one of the driveless cars mess up or glitch while on a busy highway or just on a regular road and someone gets hurt whos to blame the comapany that made the car I would feel more safe if i was in control of the car not only because I could control it if I messed up butt if someone else messed up also I could steer out of the way.

Also what if you wanted to go offroad with it and you cant becasue the car is not programed for off road so it would take the fun out of driving I think. Another reason i dont like it is that so far on the driverless cars is that the speed isnt very high as of now and if your wanting to get somewhere as fast as possible the fastest your driverless car can go is up to 25 mph and that wont get you anywhere fast. Another reason is what happens when new roads are made not everyone is going to want to update thier car just so new roads can be programed into it so it knows where to turn at and how fast it should go on the new roads. Also what if a person is walking and desideds to jump out in front of you and run to the other side of the road or there are animals on the side of the road and the car dosen't see it so it dosent know to slow down and make sure nothing is gettting ready to jump and run across the road.

So the only way I would think a driverless car would be a good idea would be if it also let you take control at any moment you wanted not just when the car needed help incase of construction work; also if the people making these driverless cars took full responability for wrecks caused by their cars and if they could possibly make them faster and made them very, very safe.
