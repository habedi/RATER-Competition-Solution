Many great talented sports players have grade c average at school and maybe cant get higher grades. Why not give students who are passing a chance to play its a passing grade and many students can only get that. What if it means that you could win the championship and the best decision of your life. Its really not fair to students that try so hard for good grades we need many students participating in a school activity maybe it'll boost their grades up because they will love it. And getting them involved in sports could keep their mind off of bad things and will have fun doing what they like. And when the policy is b average grade how are you going to let kids enjoy themselves playing sports. Maybe you should have a B average in school but when you do give that restriction your just not helping the cause of kids who want to play. So many kids are willing to change just to represent their school but you don't give them an opportunity with a restriction like that. Maybe some ideas or thoughts of how you can help them or what you can do to make sure he goes up in a grade and really be able to play with a b grade. So now kids will get an opportunity to stay on track and to play for their school and to be smarter students. That is why this restriction must not be placed for sports in that school better options and ideas would be better.
