To the principal:

Students should bring their cell phones to school and only use them during free periods and lunchtime because using phones is important; it's used for emergencies, calling other people that are in different places, and chatting with your friends from separate places. Cell phones are the important devices that are ever invented, and they are used to save on trees. Back then, people had to write letters and send them to their friends, family, and businesses.

Cell phones may cost a lot of money, but they're important to use, and you can call your parents from school if you are getting ill, and you want to use your own phone instead of the nurses' phone. Cell phones are like travel phones, you can keep them in your pocket when traveling and use them just in case you need them. I know that cell phones may be obnoxious to use during school since they have ring tones, but they are useful.

Cell phones are the new telephones, because telephones are at-home phones, and you can't take them with you when you are traveling, and besides, telephones are getting old and people would want to have a device in their pocket while in public. Telephones might have more messages than a cell phone, because people are barely home and they might have longer work shifts.

When people are at work, they are wondering who's calling them on their telephones and they might worry that they missed a call. People who are at work might be thinking about getting a cell phone instead of worrying about their telephone from home. We know that people don't like missing important calls, and they hate checking their messages. Telephones aren't made for texting like cell phones are.

Students may also want to check appointments on their own when using their cell phone, so their parents won't have to remind them about scheduled appointments, and they can remind themselves on their own. Students may want to use a calculator in their free time while using their cell phone; cell phones also have a calculator program so students won't have to bring in their own calculator when doing homework in free time, and they can just use the calculator on their cell phone.
