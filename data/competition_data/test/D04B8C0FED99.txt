The author is this article, "The Chanllenge of Exploring Venus", did a very great job to support his claim that "studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents." The suthor starts off with explaining how its our "twin" and how we couldn't touch down on it for decades. Second, he starts to write about Venus's weather conditions. Then the author talks about how scientists want invest more into to studying Venus. Finally, he talks about how we should'nt give on discovering just becasue danger lies ahead. I will be sighting the details from the text to show how the author is supporting his claim or idea.

The author exaplains that it's our closest planet to Earth and it's right terms like density and size; meaning that the author is telling us the similarties between Earth and Venus. The text states "Oftern referred to as Earth's "twin", venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." The author then talks about how Venus has note been touched in decades, which of course is very intresting matter due to the fact ist our closest planet. the text states "Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." Well due to the harsh weather conditions of course no one has been there.

The author explains the weather conditions because he wants the readers to know why NASA doesn't have so much information about Venus. The text states that "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." Meaning thats basically impossible to get any information on Venus. The article also states "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth." The author also writes about the temperture and weather more into detail. This is the author supporting detail about the danger Venus presents. Even though the very hostile conditions scientist still want to pursuit it.

NASA has a particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The article stats that since they can't go to the surface they would have hover over the fray. The author is supporting or giving exaplains on how scientist are finding ways to pursuit Venus without going to the surface. The text also states "Many reserches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." This also supports how the author is giving details of pursuing Venus even though it's very dangerous. Venus could've been a better surviable planet than Earth.

The author explains that we should'nt stop just becasue we have a few problems to reach Venus. The author states "...becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." Meaning that humans are curious and will discover or find a way o discover things no matter what. The text also states "Ours travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts" Meaning that we should'nt stop because of all the dangers. That we should "meet the very edges of imagination and innocation.

In conclusion, this is how the author did he a very good job on supporting his claim. he started off with explaing how its our "twin". Second, by explaning the weather conditions. Then by how NASA are finding solutions to get closer to Venus's surface. Finally by explaing how we should'nt stop discovering anything just becasue of the dangers of it.
