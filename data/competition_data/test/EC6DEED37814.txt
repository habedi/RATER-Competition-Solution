Dear principal

I don't think that it would be right to make are good players have to get kicked of their teams because they have Cs or C+. i think that if they have a C- or lower they shouldn't be able to play but not B or higher its just not fair. also some kids i have a hard time in school but are good at sports and maybe are school needs some good players so we can win a few games.

I'm just thinking that are players on any of our after school programs. Need to get cut a little slack or maybe we need less homework maybe that's the real problem here. That us students get over loaded with a lot of homework at school. And school and sports are hard to maintain after all we do try to get it all done but there's to much to handle with 8 classes and all.

sports to some people mean nothing but to others they mean a lot some kids do sports to impress someone. Others because they are good also. Some are living up to someone in the family like a dad or grandpa, uncle for some of them that have Cs are gunna be really upset that they will be kicked off the team because they don't have a B average.

So i don't think that you should do this to those kids that want to be on the team say they are good at the sport and they have won us lots of games we need students like that to make our school known in the other schools. So please don't make this a new rule lots of us will be sad that we wont have a team anymore...
