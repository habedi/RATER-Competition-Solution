After school activity isnt for everybody but some kids love it. At my school the principal is making every students do a after school activity and a lot of kids agree to his new rule but i disagree. Some kids that disagree cant do a after school activity cause they might of had homework. Also some kids disagree cause they have a physical disability to where they cant do many things. But most of the little amount of kids that disagree are the kids that say "I dont have time for this" and they would rather be at home playing video games,sleeping,or texting there friends. Me personally i dont like this new rule because school is already seven hours away from hour family and from daylight so why make it any longer. A lot of kids dont get to see there parents that much because they are struggling with money so they have to work longer or maybe there parents are really sick and have to stay in the hospital. Another reason is they dont have good athletic ability and they might get bullied for looking weird while running,throwing a ball,or while catching a ball. So i disagree on this rule and they need to change it. If you really think about this new rule you really realize all the bad effects compared to the good effects and there are more bad effects. When you look at the bad effects you realize one kid could be getting bullied for the way he or she runs and you dont change the rule then your really just letting bullying continue. A lot of schools have very strict rules on bullying so if something like that is happening and they dint change it then there breaking there own rule. And for the kids that just dont want to do the after school activity dont make them cause if you do there gonna give the teachers such a hard time in class and make it worste to were the teacher is just gonna give up and quit so just change the school rule. So there is my opinion on the new school rule.
