I would pick Policy one because to me it is easier if you are in sports and need to get a hold of parents and if you don't have a cell phone at school then it would be hard to reach them on away games. I can understand why some principals wouldn't want there students to have cell phones but for the kids it is much easier.

If I was the principal I would only let the kids have their cell phones during lunch and not other free times because if they have their phone during recess then that cuts away from their time of exercising.

Most kids text during school even though it isn't allowed because they think that they should be able to.

I can see why they don't want you to text in class because it would take away from the academics and then you wouldn't get as good of grades. Most kids that I know would text during study halls and lunch.

I know that it is against the rules to text during school, I only text during lunch and I never use to.

I rarely do it right now but if I need to talk to my mom or something then it should be alright to have it in your locker and text her off of it.

I don't understand how some school aren't even allowed to have their phones in school because it defeats the purpose that they should be able to call their parents. And what I understand about that is that they don't want people texting while they are in school but that really wont stop them. Most kids never even listen to the rules in school.

I can see how that would affect them in many ways but do you see how many kids would get a detention or get kicked out of something for not following the rules, most kids if they do it more then once they are more likely to do it again.

But back to the cell phone issue, at SCHOOL_NAME

we don't have that much free time the only free time we would get would have to be at lunch and every other day at recess or if you would count a study hall a day free time then that would be it.

Our school is pretty lenient on the rules though.

Last year I was carrying my phone on me and I couldn't change the alarm and I forgot to take it out of my pocked so then it went off once and I got it taken away from me and I didn't get it back until the end of the dance. Then that exact same thing happened to me a month later in the same class and I didn't get it taken away because either the teacher knew me more or she just decided not to.

But I know some people who do text during school and it doesn't effect their grades.

But to some other people it really does.

So if it was me trying to pull that off I would fail miserably because I'm not the type of person that would multi-task very easily. I would tell them not to do it or else they wouldn't be able to get good grades or then you could have them do it and see where their grades go, like an experiment.

Then you could decide if you want them to keep it with no phones in school or you would be able to have them do it in their free time.

That would be my conclusion to having Policy one be picked for SCHOOL_NAME.
