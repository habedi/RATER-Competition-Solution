Dear principal,

I disagree with you changing the policy to having to have at least a grade B to participate in sports and other activities. I disagree because a lot of people have a grade C which is an average grade. Some students are trying their hardest to get higher that a grade C but maybe don't get the subject that they have that grade in. I believe that if a student has at least a C that they are allowed to play sports and participate in other activities. If a student has a grade D or a Grade F than it would be different because those are failing grade but a grade C is not.

I also think that some kids with lower grades maybe having troubles at home or even with friends at school. If they are allowed to play sports and participate in activities at school that they could make more friends and get away from home a little bit more which may raise their grades. I also think that letting students play sports and participate in sports even if they have a grade C they could get good exercise instead of going straight home and playing video games. I don't think that keeping students with a grade C from playing sports and participating in activities will help them to get their grade up it would most likely make them mad. I do not think that you should keep students with a grade lower that a C from playing sports and participating in other activities.

Sincerely,
