I do not think individuals should have the right to use a cellular device for any reason none whatsoever while driving vehicles. Driving while engaged in any activity that could divert a persons attention from the primary task of driving. Distracted driving can fall under 3 different categories which are (visual: taking your eyes off the road), (manual: taking your hands off the wheel.), and (cognitive: taking your mind off what you are doing). The Harvard center of risk analysis shows a study of that estimates cell phone use while driving contributes to 6% of crashes, which equates to 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries and 2,600 deaths each year including a tab that is $43 billion .

Activities that can be distractive are cellphone usage, eating, drinking, reading, changing the radio station, doing makeup, doing hair, talking to passengers in the car. The reason why I chose this is because during the year there are 1.6 million crashes each year. Although, nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. The other reason why I chose this decision is because when you send or read a text message, you take your eyes off the road for about 5 seconds, long enough to cover the length of a football field while driving at 55 mph. However, 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States I caused by cell phone usage. Approximately, each day in the United States 9 people are killed more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to be involved by a driver distracted by their cellular device.

During the past years there have been 1.6 million car crashes each year. The people that text while driving are 23 time more than likely to have a car wreck and pass away. However, texting while driving take your eyes off the road for 5 seconds at a time which means your eyes are of the road for a distance of 300 feet. Although, many people in the world expects a reply from a total of 2-5 minutes which puts tremendous pressure on them that makes them want to respond faster. However, 60% of drivers admit to using their cellphones while driving. 3,328 people were killed and 421,000 people were injured in accidents involving distracted drivers in 2012. Even though you don't think about it but texting increases your crash risk to 23% more than when not distracted.

In the United States automobiles are a way of life and car accidents are an inevitability. Although, teens think it is so important to text while driving 143 million that communicate daily, there's no doubt that car accidents are bound to happen to be no end in sight. Yearly roughly 1.3 million people die from worldwide car accidents. There is an average of 3,287 deaths per day. From the age of 15-44 they are responsible for all road traffic deaths. Most fatal crashes led to 37,461 total fatalities, including 25,096 vehicle occupants, 5,286 motorcyclists, and 7,079 nonoccupants. The ages 16-19 year old has the higher risk of motor vehicle crashes. However, 15% of drivers ages 15-20 involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year. While on the other hand on average 3,287 deaths a day. However, 20-50 million people are injured during car crashes.
