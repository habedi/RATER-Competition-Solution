Many students in school feel angry, tired, bored, or happy when they walk in to school. Dr. Huang, of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinios explains its helpful reasons to be used in school.

In the text Dr. Huang predicts, "A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored ... Then it coud modify the lesson"(D'Alto Paragraph 6). This shows teachers and instructors can come up with plans and lessons that will better student learning. Most of the bored and confused students t do not achieve highly in school is somtimes cause by the lesson that a teacher gives, which can make students struggle in daily learning.

This can impact the school testing level scores and student actions if school is not enjoyable from them. From the quote, "A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored" can improve the teachers and instructors lesson plans better. Then,"modify the lesson" will improve student learning too. This could would be a great way to help the schools and students become smarter and succeed in lessons based on expressons.
