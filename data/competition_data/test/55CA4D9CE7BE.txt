If my principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Such as sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council I would strongly disagree with the decision. Although I think extracurricular activities are good for students I still think it would be a bad idea. Even if some students will be able to do a extracurricular activity others might not have the time, the skill set, or even the dedication to participate in any of the extracurricular activities, therefore it would be a bad idea to require students to do an extracurricular activity.

The main reason I think this would be a bad idea is that most students will not have the time to do an extracurricular activity. Mainly because they could have plans before or after school and possibly on the weekends that would hinder them from being able to go to their activity. Some students might even do extra curricular activities outside of school so there would be no reason for them to do it inside of school too. It would also be unfair to require kids to do a extracurricular activity because if they have already spent most of their time on weekdays at school working hard. Why should they have to take even more time out of their day to go to a extracurricular activity?

Another, reason I do not think this would be a good idea is because of the skill set most of the extracurricular activities require just for you to be successful in them. For example, not all students are athletic enough to do sports, artistic enough to do the yearbook, or even responsible enough to be on the student council. you can not require someone to be in an extracurricular activity if they dont even fit the skill set the everybody else has. You also can not expect someone who has no experience in something to be able to do it out of nowhere. Not every student will be able to do an activity that will allow them to be successful, therefore it would be unfair to force all the students to do a extracurricular activity.

Finally, i think this is a bad decision because if students do not want to do an extracurricular they probably will not be dedicated enough to actually work hard and try their best to get stuff done. For example, while the students who want to do an extracurricular activity are working hard the other students who do not want to be there might not do any work or not paying attention to whats going on. the students who dont want to be there could even effect the whole group of people by simply not paying attention. if students were to be messing around instead of getting there work done there would be no solution because if the you tried to kick them out of the activity then everybody else might start acting up just to get out of the activity.

Although, I believe extracurricular activities can be be beneficial in someways I still believe it is a bad decision to require students to do them. It would be completely unfair to the students who dont have the time, the skill, or the determination to do so. these reasons just go to show that it would be a bad decision to require students to do an extracurricular activity.
