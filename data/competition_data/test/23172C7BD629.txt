I think you should have to have a certain grade to play sports, because of several reasons. It will set a bad example, and it won't always get you somewhere.

It will set a bad example, because the people who do make good grades and play sports will think they don't have to try as hard in school. They will slack off and probably be held back, and not go to college. They will think because someone else can do it and still play the fun sports then so can they.

It won't get them anywhere. People who play sports would probably think they could get a free ride to college with a sports scholarship. Except without there good grades they won't make it nowhere.

This is why i think you should have to make a B average to play sports. Life wouldn't be very easy. More and more people would end up broke and living in a box or in there parents basement. So making them try would save a lot of people.
