I believe the first policy works best because students need their cell phones to reach their parents and/or guardians in case of emergency . This is also true because students spend most of their awake hours at school so they need to keep their parents updated on what's going on at school . Not only that the new thing on cell phones is internet and students need the internet to work on projects . Cell phones come in handy also to tell your friends not go to science class today because we are in the lab so go to the lab . Without cell phones i bet the student home work turn in rate goes down considering some students don't have a computer at home much less internet. Cell phones are always helping students weather its telling your parents theirs something wrong at school or telling your friend that science class is in the lab today so they don't go to the science class room go to the lab or even a student trying to use the internet to finish an assignment in which you need the internet for it proves very helpful .The bottom line is if teachers can use them then the students can.
