I think its not fair that students at least have to have a B average to attend sports because some students try really hard in school. also if an student loves sports alto but they have an C average. just because students have an C average? so why cant they participate in after school academic sports. I don't think its fair that students cant participate in sports if they have an C average. school is sometimes hard for students and asking them to get an C for in order for them to play sports. some students try really hard in school. and its just hard at times. some students cant get an C. some students might have all C' s on their report card so that wouldn't make it right for them to have to get an B to attend sports. you cannot expect students to get an the best grades. because students are not perfect. some are really smart but not perfect. so why? its hard in classes! I know your thinking well they should try harder. that the problem some students try hard but they still don't understand the materials that the teacher is teaching. so what if some get an C still let them play sports. does it really matter what grade a student haves they should still be allowed to play sports. I don't think its fair. schools have smart students in their schools but is never the smartest student on campus. that will make some students feel really sad. so its not fair its just an C it will get better. students try really hard in school. just give students time.
