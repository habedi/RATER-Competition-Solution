The technoligy I dont think will be able to read the expressions from the people in my classroom because i dont that there is such a technolighy like this because it sounds almost impossible to evr make something liike this because it was back then and back then there was not anyhting like this or even untill this day there is nothing like it

Then if there was ever something like this technoligy i dont think it will work very well considering that every one is in school and mostly when anybody is in school they are usually bummed out about being in school and i think the machine will read mixed emotions and the computer or the device will read everyones emotions wrongs because like they say id in the first paragragh how she had mixed emotions I think that that is pretty crazy to have for just one person because

I dnt think just one person can ever hve that many emotions even if was a cartoon or a painting

Lastly i dont think that everybody in my school will allow the emotion reader decide there amotions because like me I will not feel comfortable with one of those readers lie many other people in my classroom will be comfortable with that reader to decde or find out there emotions because the reader might get the wrong emotion and people might start making fun of other peoples emotions and there might be a big argument with the reader and somebody might get mad because that is not how they are feeling and people might get mad because the reader might say something about somebodys buisness and people might get embarassed about what other people might think about ther hidden emotions.
