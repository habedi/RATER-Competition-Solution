In the story The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author explains why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author says no matter how dangerouse it is we need to study it because it may well once have been the most Earth-lie planet in our solar system. The author also says that long ago Venus might have been able to support various forms of life, just like earth. Scientists also think that it used to be covered largely with oceans. Venus alos has a rocky surface with some valleys, mountains, and craiters.

The author thinks that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. This is something we really have to think about given how long it takes to travel in space. It is almost to dangerouse to explore Venus on the ground so scientists are trying to build blimp -like vehicles to float above Venus. The blimp would have to be about 30 miles in the air to avoid all the storms. The only problem with this is that researchers can't get samples of rock, or anything else, from a distance.

So even though Venus is very dangerouse to explore NASA is trying to find a way to explore it and get more information on itto see if thigs used to be able to live on it and maybe to see if anything could live on it today. Even though it is very dangerouse I think Venus needs to be explored. I think that if a species could live on Venus that would be great so I think we need to keep trying to find ways to explore it. It is very dangerouse but I htink that scientists will definetly find a way to explore Venus one day.
