Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? What do you guys think that student can do it on there own?.Many student learn in different ways;some students like to work together and others like to work alone in a quiet place where they can focus on there work or what they are thinking;other students like to play around and not do there work. I feel like we would be more successful if we had a little more time in out class if we work in a quiet place. we will be something in life by taking this classes from home and not wasting time with our life. This are my two reason why I said it was a good idea and a bad idea that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

The reason why i said yes,students would get benefits from being able to attend classes from home. You would have more time to do work at home. Will be able to work in a quite place where no one can bother you or lose focus from your work. If you have any emergency or have not finish your work you can always go back to it at any time. I fell like you would be able to move on and learn more then others that don't work you pace. On the other hand some students need more classes to graduate or to catch up with their credits. If you finish early you would be able to have time with your family,friend or have time to sleep. I feel like you would be able to do it when you try your best with and taking time with it. It's good because you can get work done without anyone bothering you it just you and the computer.

The reason why i said no,students would not get benefits from being able to attend classes from home Because some student like to be lazy to do their work. When it come to work at home we would rather slept the whole day. we would have forgotten that we had work to because it just slip out of my mind or doing something important. we would have been getting work in late so it won't be counted as full credit. They would rather be doing other thing,for an example playing video games,be playing outside,or being lazy all day long. There might be a question that you may not know and ask someone else and they might not know ether. The reason i said no was because not all student would not try to get there work done or not try there best to keep up what they need. Some teacher think we can or we can not because we have proven our self to them. Half of us don't learn and still mess around with other people then doing work that we are suppose to do and learn new thing.

In conclusion this are my reason why students would or wouldn't get benefit by being able to attend classes at home. In my knowledge students are taking classes from home. What i know is that some student are trying there best and other are are just giving up on it. I know that i am suppose to take a class at home to catch up with my credits. i am going to try my best to try to get a good income. I hope i would not get a bad benefit out of this. It's our chose to take the class or not only if we need it and only if you want to be successful in life.
