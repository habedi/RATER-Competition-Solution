Should people who are driving be able to use cell phones while they drive? I strongly disagree, as there are new teens driving everyday. Teens tend to use their phones a lot and they probably haven't been driving as much as some adults. Regardless of how long you have been driving i personally think you should not be texting and driving, or doing anything with your phone. Teens are probably the people who cause most of the crashes due to them texting and driving or not focusing on the road.

Most teens take driving as if they were in a video game. I believe they use this thought process because in some video games you tend to do reckless driving and i think some teens take that idea. I personally think that ever since smart phones came out the car crash rates have gone up extremely. This is due to the egear of wanting to use your cellular device. I don't think we can stop texting and driving because most people do it and then act innocent when they see a police car near them. I know this from experience.

I disagree with this because people's lives are in danger with just a swipe or just writing a 3 letter text. You keep your eyes off the road which means anything can happen in the slightest second. I think there should be some type of app that you have to use in order to turn your car on, which then locks your phone until the car is off or you have reached your destination. Texting and driving is a serious cause and teens & adults should take this more seriously so they can risk not getting into an accident.
