Dear Senator,

I believe we should change the electoral college. In my opinion the electoral college is unfair. To begin with it reduces the amount of voters because the voters believe they don't have a say in the election. As Richard A. Ponser said "It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California."In addition, we do not directly vote for the president, we vote for people who we believe will vote for the president. Also I don't think it is fair that if a candidate gets the majority vote he/she should recieve all of the votes from the state. I believe we should go to direct voting. Where we the people get to directly vote for the president and after the whole nation has voted we tally up the votes and see who got the most. This method would be best because people would prefer it more and it would make people believe they have a say in who becomes the president. In addition, it is better than the Electoral College because there is less room for errors and it will not be as unfair. In addition, it will make the candidates work harder to get votes and they will try to visit more of the states because if they know that if the majority of a state is democratic they believe they will easily win the votes from that state, but if it was direct voting they would go to these states to make sure they can get as many votes possible from it. Also another issue with the Electoral College is the picking of the electors. The picking of the electors could be bad because these electors could be bad people who get a lot of votes for one candidate but still pick the other one. To conclude I believe we should get rid of the Electoral College because it is an unfair voting system. Instead we should change to direct voting where every vote counts.

Sincerely,

Bobby
