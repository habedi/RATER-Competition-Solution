Dear Principal,

I don't think you should change the policy so that only students with grade B average can participate. I don't think you should change it because a lot of the students have a grade C average. I think they should be able to play sports or participate in other activities because they love the sports they play or activities the participate in.

You shouldn't take that away from them just because they have a C. Some students try their hardest to get even that. If you took the things they loved away they would be left knowing even though they tried and got a C, now they couldn't play their favorite sports either. They're A lot of the students that have a C average, and for the ones that don't they might not have enough people to be on their team and then they might not be able to play as well, because they have to have a certain amount of people to play and they don't.

If you didn't let kids play because of their grade, and the remaining kids didn't have enough people to play you wouldn't only be taking away other students opportunities but every ones.

Some of the kids might not be able to go to collage without a scholarship and the only way they could get a scholarship would be through sports. If they couldn't play sports then they couldn't get the scholarship and they wouldn't be able to go to collage.

Taking away someone's sports is more than it seems. If you take away these kids sports you could be taking away their life, and you could be taking away their jobs in the future, because if you don't get a scholarship you can't go to collage, and if you can't go to collage it's going to be harder for them to get a good job. If its harder for them to get a job then they won't be able to support themselves when they need to.

I hope this helps you to realize it's more than just taking away their sports. To them it's not just a game they play its what they do. By changing the policy you could change life's, and that's not necessarily for the better. Maybe now you can see our side of this argument, and you won't change the policy.
