Dear Principal,

I know that you are thinking of changing the school policy so that students can only participate in sports or any other activity unless they have at least a grade B average. You said that you would like to hear students' opinion on the situation, so I am telling you that I do not agree because of a C average is still passing, and what if by holding a student back just because they don't have a C average or higher, you stunt their growth? I will also explain these reasons in depth.

Firstly starting off, a C average is still passing. Some students are not capable of just getting A's and B's. Some students get C's on a regular. Now if the student is getting a D, then I would agree with you. A D is passing, but just barely. And what principal would want a student in their school that is great in sports and every club possible, but is just barely passing in their grades? To me, that is embarrassing and I understand why you would suspend them fro, participating in sports then, but otherwise, I find it terribly wrong.

Another reason is, what if by holding a student back just because they don't have a C average or higher, you stunt their growth? As I mentioned before, in order for some students to learn to do the right thing, they need to be suspended from certain things, but for other people, it does no good. If a student is getting a D or lower, you should sit them down along with their guardian and talk with them about how if they want to continue to be in a an activity or sport, they will need to get their grades up. And then if they choose not to do so, then it is their own fault because you did your part in trying to help them.

In conclusion, by explaining this to you, I hope that you understand that by changing your school policy to where as only people with a B average or higher can participate in an activity. You could be preventing the next richest person in the world, or better yet, the President of the United States. As you can see, changing your school policy to only allowing students with a B average or higher is unfair and could possibly be classified as stunting one's growth.
