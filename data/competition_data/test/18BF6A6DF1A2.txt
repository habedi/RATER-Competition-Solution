I disagree i think students should do it willing not forced to because they might have other plans to do. For example, maybe they have after school activity, or chores and homework which will lean stress to the student and it impact his or her learning envoirment probably because they did not had enough time to relax. Are teens brain functions when we enjoyed something like hanging out with friends, playing video games using social Medea or going out places well you get the idea what am trying to say is if we don't have free time then we wouldnot be able to participate in learning subjects also might fail the year and have to restarted and no one wants to do the same thing for a another year. I mean some students might be able to handle this extracurricular activity but the majority of students can't because they use excessive phone time, laze or being tired from doing lots of work its just there brains are still learning to be more mature and use time Wesley.

I also agree because it might help students to be prepared for the real world like planing lets say if i was in this position i would plan out time like i go to sleep at 9pm put a alarm clock at 5.30 am wake up take a shower brush my teeth put clothes on have breakfast walk to school after do extracurricular activity walk home have dinner do homework and chores and then rest of time left i do free time. Back to the question i think its good because students might find something they never know thanks to extacurricular in sports or teaching maybe they want to be in NBA,NFL, soccer team or be teacher and if they study hard and focus they will be able to achieve there dream job.

And if this dose happens in my school it will have lots of pros and cons.
