Dear TEACHER_NAME

I don't think that making everyone do community service would be a good idea.

Not all of the students have time to, some have to care for siblings, some have to work, and others don't even live nearby. It doesn't seem fair to these people. Some will be able to, but not all have the time or money to do this. If you do this during school you cut valuable skills out of their education.

Some would just be to lazy to do it, others travel a lot which also doesn't allow them perform community service. Although some would love this others would hate it. some have family members in the hospital, by making them do community service you cut out time to spend with their families. What about people with diseases? They could get sick, or possibly be killed by something they touch, or inhale. Some may have family members that have died, and need to go to their funeral.

I myself have no diseases, no sick family members, and I don't travel a lot but I have to watch my little brother, and make sure my older brother does his treatments for Cystic Fibrosis, a disease that affects lung function. I can't do it because of these factors, others may have these factors and more. By taking time out of classes you would not be doing your job of giving us an education, so that we can learn the skills needed to succeed in life. Those with certain diseases can die by one mistake, touching something they're allergic to added to the effects of their diseases which could lower their lung function for example, could you live with knowing you may have caused someone to die?

Just think about these, would it be fair to have someone whose in poverty have to spend money to help the community when they barely have enough for themselves? Is it fair for the child whose mom, or dad, is laying on her, or his, death bed to be unable to see her, or him? Is it fair for the child with a disease is going to kill him to have to quit spending time with his, or her family? Just look at all the reasons to start mandatory community service, now look at the reasons not to a lot more aren't there?

Your student,
