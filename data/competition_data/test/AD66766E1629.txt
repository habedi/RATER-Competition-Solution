I think the principal should use policy number one because i think that is what students want that is so if they have friends far away they can talk to them and one my part that is what I would do if I was the principal I would let the kids. Do that because they have friends they want to talk that are in another class and plus what if they need to get picked on they can call there mom in like lunch and ask for him or her to come and get them and that is so the teacher does not. Have to know what is going on and what happened because that is not there problem to worry about and plus if you tell the teacher what happened it will get around the school some how . Because there are teacher pets in school and so they will tell there friends and that is why i think that the principal should let the school use are phones and think about this what if something goes wrong and there is not a teacher around you will have your phone to call for help. But then the kid will want to text in class so then I can see why to but i would be more happy if the principal let us use are phones in school hours. But there is a good thing about having your phone in school now most phones have calculators in side them so in stead of using a calculator you can use your phone and they can call there mom if they don't feel good.
