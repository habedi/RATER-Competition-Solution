In the following essay I'm going to talk about how this new technology called Facial Action Coding System or FACS help us to identify human emotions. I think that the use of this new technology will be completely valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. Will the use of this new technology be helpful to the teacher? Will this techonolgy be use just inside of classrooms?

In different situations know how a person feels is important, not just because the person will probably need help but to understand the emotion the person is feeling. I believe that this kind of new technology will be more than helpful inside of the classrooms at schools because the technology can tell the teacher wether the students are learning or not; Can also tell the teacher if he needs to improve himself to make the class even interesting instead of bored. I think this kind of technology has to be used not just inside of schools but can also be used at important places like the goverment or the police departments not just to solve issues but to collaborate with them for the good of everyone.

In conclusion, this new technology is a big step for the humanity. This new technology can improve the learning method by knowing the facial expressions and make it even better. Just imagine all the good things this technology can do for us. Its amazing the multiple things that are being developed and the use of the Facial Action Coding System is one of those things.
