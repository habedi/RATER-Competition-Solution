The authors supporting details is pretty well. The author want to study the planet. His supporting detail are pretty good. The text states "Often referred to ss Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closet planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance to." The deatil really inetsting. A third grader can be really interested and would like to read more.

" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus... On the planet's surface, tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater thn what we experianceon our own planet." I usually get lost to half the paragraph by now, but because it's so well written, ijust want to ead more.

The authors has really good supporting details. Th reader will know what he would be talking about what he mean. i would think that a lot of student would be interested to study other planets because if thus article is well written.
