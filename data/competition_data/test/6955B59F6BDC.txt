Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard you are pondering whether to make all children do community service or not. I think I might help you make up your mind. I think it is a wonderful idea to make the children do community service. I think it builds good character and moral. While their learning to care more for the community it helps it look better too. Picking up trash and cleaning up could influence people not to litter because they realize how much work it is to pick it up. Maybe the middle school started a tutoring business and half of your failing students averages went up to a B. How wonderful would that be?

Do you feel envious when you drive through a town with nice houses and clean streets and sidewalks? Doesn't it make you feel welcome there? Well what if that was your town? You could make it your town just by making one change. For those people who struggle to find time for anything you could just say they need only 20 hours for the school year. This decision could teach the children to be better and more caring people. It's a win win situation here. Why not take it?

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
