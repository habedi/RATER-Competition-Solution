luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. luke couldn't say no .he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. their was a world war 2 but is was over. Then they recover their food supplies and animals.44 nations joined together to form unrra ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrtion). I think that Animals need to be care of because thy needfood water and family to stay with. Some animals need to a vet because the dont fell better and doctors need to make them better. And people can adoppte them to have a home.

people should join the program because people can learn how to love an animal that u have seen befor or not seen befor in your life. Or new Animals that are new thatpeople have never seen before Animals need to be feeded because without food they cant live for ever they can die . and their babys need to find food by themself. Without their mom's and dad's to find for the baby's to grow up like them
