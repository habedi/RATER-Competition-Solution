Dear TEACHER_NAME, yes i think that all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME should attend in this community service. I think so because if all of the students attend in this we all could be able to clean up to help each and other and maybe help the teachers clean up in their rooms or just help people in the clean up after school. I know i' m one the students that doesn't like working or working for someone but i want to help our community keep our world a better place. Like for an ex: I'm walking down the hall way and i see paper fall and i pick it up, or i see someone in the hall way and someone drops their books i can stop and help them pick it up. That will make you and that person feel good inside and even make you feel good. It will you feel like you want to help other people. IF someone is crying or need someone to talk to your rite there to talk to them, to let them say what bringing them down or something they had on their mind all day and they want to tell someone but they cant because no one wants to hear what have to say. That's another way that you can help someone too. Now if non of the students don't participate in the community service thing then we will have a very bad school, or a bad location to live at because no one helps each other. They will always be fights and arguments because nobody cares about anybody's feelings. Doing this may take up my time but it is worth helping people and our community. Maybe in my older years i could come back down to the 8th or maybe the 1st grade and tell the kids how my life was when i was in there grade, and how i wouldn't listen or talk back to the teachers and stuff like that but when get older you will realize that all that could of been better. Like that wasn't me like i could be better and i can bring my grades up and listen to my teachers when they talk to me.
