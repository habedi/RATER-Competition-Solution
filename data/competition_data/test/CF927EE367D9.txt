What if a computer can reconize when a person is confused, bord, sad, happy, angry, suprise, or even in fear. There are 44 major facial muscles like when your are suprised your eyebrows raises or when you are angry your teeth and lips tighten up. This could help determain rather a person is not telling the truth.

The text states that "Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. For example If you smile when a web ad appers on the screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown to the next ad will be different." This could even help teachers Like if "A classroom coumpter could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts That it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."

The text also states that someday computers will be able to read people. Like a lip reader reads people without sound. Most human communication is nonverble. "To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are something used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

According to the Facial feedback Theroy of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them." It takes more muscles to frown than it dose to smile.

I think that this could help soliders in combat to read a suside boomer or intaragate people. But this complex algorithm is still a ways away. Whoever thought there were so much science in emotions!!!
