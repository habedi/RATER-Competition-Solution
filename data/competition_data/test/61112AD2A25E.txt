I would like to take the position on whether students should be required to perform community service.

Yes, they should do community service at least two times a month to make their environment better around them.

It would help them to be familiar with by the time they are grown.

Some examples are, going to clean the church, picking up trash in their neighborhood and most of all picking up trash on the football fields.

Some of the students can go clean up the church.

It is very helpful that they can clean up the church.

Cleaning the church will help you be more apart of doing something with your church members.

If you pick trash up in your community it will not be so dirty.

Helping the environment around you clean can make others wanting to clean their community.

Keeping a community very clean will make the people around you help.

Cleaning the football field clean will help your school be more clean.

I think keeping the football field clean, people want talk about your school so much. A nasty environment some of the older people do not like at all.

It will help them to come out more and keep our community clean

To some this all up keeping a good community will help your community be as neat as you want it to.

This is why i think students should keep a clean community around them.
