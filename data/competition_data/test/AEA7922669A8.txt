Dear Principal,

I thing helping the community is very important because we can make it a better place to us and others that care about the community too. Your community would look better if we start cleaning up after ourselves and others that care. People that care about there community would help us clean after others that don't care about there community. The people that do care would do lots of thing for the community to make it look bigger, cleaner, and better. With a clean community with could do lots of more things in the environment. The things we could do better is be nice, pick up the trash that's on the floor, clean after yourself, and the environment would be a better place. It could be a clean place if the people clean after themselves and help the people that are cleaning it. That's what my position is cleaning after other's and myself so that's what i think.
