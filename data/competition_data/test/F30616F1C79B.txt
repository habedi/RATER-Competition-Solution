Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student designed?

Summer break Is a great time to have fun,this Is the time when students get off school for a few months before the new school year. This time Is when Kids get to go to the beach,parties and other fun places that they couldn't go during the school year. But Not all students get to enjoy their break, most students go into summer break with assign projects ,that they have to bring to school on the next school year. This can cause a students summer vacation to be stressful and long,teachers are the ones to blame for the designs of these terrible hard projects,that students have to worry about;all throughout summer break. These projects should be designed by students ,they know how hard and easy to design the projects. By making this change, kids would be stressed free and actually enjoy their well deserved summer break.

Even though it's a great way to stick knowledge into a students head,Teachers design the paper how they think will help the Students,not how they know it will help them. Teachers do not ask the students for feed back and opinions, on how to create these summer break projects. Because teachers do not ask students for for general feed back, Summer break projects will be impossible to complete in a short period of time, causing students to complete them all through out their summer break. These hard Teacher designed projects causes students to feel stressed into completing their assigned summer break projects designed by their teachers,this will mean that students wont learn anything during their break .Teachers are professionals who know how to stick knowledge into a students brain,but no one really wants to do a stressful,long and time consuming project that was made by a teacher who doesn't know that summer break is to relax and not to be stressed.

Because teachers dont know how stressful summer break projects can be. The school should leave it up to the students, to design these summer break projects. Teachers can argue that they are well experience on the things they need to put on these projects learn and what they dont need to put. However, they don't know,because they aren't the students and have no experience being a student completing the assignment. Students have general knowledge on what they have learned and what they will needed to learn. If students were to designed these summer break projects there is a possibility they would be shorter, easier and fundamentally designed compared to teachers design. With the students background knowledge and experience,Students will create a very well designed summer break project which will motivate students to want to complete it and make their summer stress free while still learning what they need to learn.

In conclusion because a teacher-designed project can be very difficult and stressful,a student-designed project will be further more beneficial and convenient for a student .With a teachers-designed project, students will not enjoy their summer vacation ;and also cause the student to not want to complete the assignment, causing the student to not reach their goal of getting their fundamental learning during the summer break. Compared to a teacher-designed project a student-designed project is way better. Because a student is way more experience than a teacher ,the students will know what to put in the project and what not to put in the project. School can be very hard and when students get that little 3 month summer break is to have fun and go out,and not to be stressing over a summer break project that was designed by a teacher who made things very difficult.
