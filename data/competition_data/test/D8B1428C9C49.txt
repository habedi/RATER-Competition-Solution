i believe students should be able to bring a cell phone to school and be able to use it in passing times and free time. students often are late to class because they are talking to friends. If they were able to txt them they wouldn't have to run down to there locker and tell them and get books and do what they have to do. They could get to class on time and no ISR if they are needing a calculator during a study hall they could use there cell phone or if they needed to take notes and didn't get them they could take a picture of it. Students are often caught with cell phones in class txting if they were aloud to txt during free time they wouldn't have to text in class. students could pay more attention to school instead of worry about txting they would worry about that in there free time. Students could also txt there parents and tell them they are staying after school for something. Students should be able to bring phones to school and use them during free time as long as they are shut off during class time.
