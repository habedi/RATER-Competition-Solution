Have you ever thought of going to Mar's? If so would you like to learn some good information? Would you be afraid to go? I would love to go to Mar's but since I am a lame 8th grade girl I will not be going anytime soon. So I figured I would tell you a story that happened In Mar's On May 24, 2001.

Well on May 21, 2001 something funny happened around Mar's NASA was snaping photos of Mar's when it seen a shadowy that kinda looked like a human face. Nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be starting back at the camera's from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.

Couple days later NASA was looking throgh all of the photo's when he noticed the "shadow's giving the illusion of eyes, noes, and mouth." Thats when they thought it would be a great idea to engage the publice and attract attention to Mar's.

Just becuase of this picture they took on Mar's it became a "pop icone". People call it the "face on Mar's" It's now a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows. But not only that it even was in Grocery store cheackout lines for 25 years! Some people thought the face is telling us that there is life on Mar's. Other's just thought it just happened to look like a face. But there is my story about Mar's maybe one day you will right a story about me being on Mar's.
