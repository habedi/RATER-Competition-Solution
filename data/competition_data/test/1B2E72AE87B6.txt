Should students be able to use their phones on school property? Well, it has came to my concern that you are doubting the students but, if you ask me, I would say policy 2 because of 3 very specific reasons that I will be talking about. I believe students should be able to use their phones during their free time so that they can do the following:

1. Be able to make important phone calls 2. Use it to help you as a educational resource 3. Contact teacher Twitter accounts

Well, my first reason is being able to make important phone calls. This is my first reason because I know what it feels like to not have a phone and need to make a very important call. Sometimes you don't have another choice and you have to go to the office and use the office phone. Then, in a couple of minutes, there is a very long line in the office just to use the phone! Phones are very necessary at school, so please, let them use their phones.

My second reason is to use it as an educational resource because you can use it as a calculator, dictionary, thesaurus, etc. There are thousands of ways that you can use a phone educationally. For example, if your teacher needs help looking up a word or something, you help her out by looking it up on your mobile dictionary. That is another great reason why students should get to use their cell phones.

My third and final reason is that students can also access their teachers' Twitter accounts. That is very important for students because they can access their homework anytime. For example, when you are sick, you can go to your teachers twitter account and be caught up on your homework. That is pretty much it! So now, my question to you is, Should students be able to use their phones on school property?
