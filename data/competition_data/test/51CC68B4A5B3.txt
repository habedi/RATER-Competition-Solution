The world has been evolving in technology for a significant amount of time. Technology has been helping people learn easier and faster to a certain degree before. Using this resource have proven it beneficial standings but it is not ideal to use in a school distance learning setting. Students using this course could stumble upon a good amount of problems that could stump their learning ability. This could isolated the student, prove an easier way for cheating, and not everyone has internet access that wants to take this course.

First, isolating a student could play a part in not getting all the information they could get at school from teachers. In fact, this could be backed up with that not every student has the same learning ability. Many districts show different techniques that if a student do online it could be different way than they are taught; therefore, setting a student of their regular pace to work ethnic that is slower and less efficient. Parents are available but not many of them would be able to help their child because they either do not remember this subject or they learn something different while they were growing up. Isolating someone could show less development in learning how to function around other peers in a similar environment and also the outside world. Students use the time during school to find what they going to do, to find themselves, and to experience other people that is not related to them. Learning to combat all of these components could show if they are ready to stay true to themselves and realize what their limits are.

Next, cheating is still a big problem in a normal school setting but it will grower even larger if the students is left at home with their own devices. More technology could be available than in a school because there is no one to stop them in middle of class to get off their phone and to take it away. This could lead to the involvement of sending pictures to a fellow student either in the same class or a person that has the class next. Also less of a punishment they could receive from a principal or a teacher to tell this is a terrible thing to do. Then, plagiarism is a leading factor because there are websites that can do a student's work for them. This could prove that the student does not know what they are learning about because they are not being closely watched by a teacher in a actual school setting.

Finally, not every family has internet stability or is not capable of have a luxury for any of their children to take theses courses. A limit amount of students could not prove that this should be added to the schools program then having any time wasted and money on a program with little students participating. A unfair advantage with students that are competing with class rank because one student could get on a online program while the other could not. However, many district would say that they are able to work with more teachers from other schools than having to work with a smaller chance to find a specific teacher for a certain class. However, that could be a good idea but at what cost will it take to pay for all of this. Not many teachers will work for free because this cloud add more to their work load they are not ready for. This also need some type of knowledge to work with time schedule and knowing how to set up the class that is going to be online that most do not have time for.

In conclusion, schools offering for online classes and video conference is not beneficial to their students of their district. Many factor that could disprove the contribution of any of this idea of working is through cheating, not everyone have internet access at home, and isolation of a student. There a significant concerns to whether this will work but it will be a waste of time trying to figure out if it worth it because not all classes could be taught by screen, like wood shop. Many people are more pleased with a face to face examples to how it is done than through a screen which can not show all the ways it should be done.
