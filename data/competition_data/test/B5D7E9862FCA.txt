Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue to learn over their break. Many of these projects would be teacher-designed so the students can learn about a certain subject. However, students should have the choice to choose what topic they would like to do their project on.

Student-designed projects would assure the students completion for the summer assignment. Having it be their project gives them limitless options on what to write about. For instance, in middle school I had a summer assignment and it was to write about any topic and present it. At first I thought it would be a challenging project but then once I realized that I can write about anything it was just a matter of choosing the best topic. The summer assignment allowed me to think about different topics and evaluate them to see which one would be the best to talk about. Therefore, student-designed projects are best to assure completion by giving students more options and less stress to think about a topic they don't want to do.

In addition, students will learn more information and values when researching topics. Students will be more armed and ready with more information when they return from their summer break. Not only will they be learning many different information they would also be learning the values of many different topics. For example when I was doing the summer assignment in middle school I learned the values of cultures and traditions, how you should help the sea by recycling your plastic materials, and how to appreciate what you have. If I hadn't had the option to do choose my topic than I wouldnt have known the information I know now.

On the other hand teacher-designed projects are best because they helps students learn and prepare for the next school year. Teacher-designed projects help if your trying to advance in a subject or if your trying to get ahead of the game. Students will return from their summer break feeling confident in what they're doing in class since they continued to learn the curriculum over their break.

All in all, student-designed projects are better for students. They let the students explore information that's not taught in school and opens the minds of students. Students will be less stress if they had a topic of their choosing and will be more motivated to do the work. Student-designed projects are overall is better for students learning.
