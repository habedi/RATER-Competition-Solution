Dear TEACHER_NAME,

If a student will not try to improve his/her grade you can change it to a b o above. The first thing you can do is have all the teachers tell you the student that play sports grades. After you see a week of the students grades then you can decide if they should have to quit the team until there grade goes up to at least a b.

Here are a few other ways to keep students grades up first talk to each student the does sports about their grades, second talk to the parents about what to do with the students bad grades, and last tell the coach about each students grades.

If any students do not bring their grades up on tests and homework then make them promise to get good grades on the test and homework if they want to play sports again. I realized that if you take something important away they would act better. Every two weeks you should check their grades if some came up and others didn't. I would recommend talking with the teachers and students and ask why haven't your grades come up. If they say they where out last week and just got back check with the teachers to make sure they are telling the truth.

Some students may need help, because they are confused about the work the teacher gave them and not asking for help this could be a reason some students never bring their grade up from a c . You should talk to them and see if they have had trouble with any work they were given if they say yes then try and tell them that they should ask the teachers for help instead of failing. I hope you can per
