Some schools require students to make summer projects to assure they continue learning during break, it might be a good idea for schools to do this, that way students will have a lot time to complete the work, and at the same time the students would not forget what was learned during all school year, the best way to do this, is that the teachers make the designed for the project and not the students, to make it more challenging and hard to do.

The teacher-designed idea can be the best way to let the student get a summer-project that is difficult,challenging, and that contain all the things learned in the whole year of class, this way students will use their notes and thing that were made in the on the school year, for example the teacher can make a project with questions that need information from the past notes,that way students will need to find and read again all their notes in order to make this project, if the student make her own project, it can be easy for them and not that hard to complete, because the student will try to make a project that can be complete fast and that don't take a lot time.

Students during summer break have a lot time to do many things, sometimes during summer, students don't find something to do and most of them waste a lot time, a better way to not waste that time during vacations, is to make a project, that's why is better for the school to make the project by the teacher-designed, this way it can be longer and challenging for the student to complete, the more time that is led to complete this project can led students to be more creative and to try to make a really good project to get a good grade on it and this will let to think more about the things learned on school too.

When schools made this summer project a requirement for all students to complete, it was to make sure that the students will continue learning during their break and that way students don't lose what was learned, another thing is that can make student to be more creative, for example is a teacher-designed project was about, things that students do during theirs summer vacations, this can make the student to not stay in home all day, because it will not be a good project to do, or to stay playing videogames, the student will prefer to go out and talk about that things.

The main ideas for the schools by doing this is to make the students more responsible, and to make sure that they continue learning, it will be almost the same as summer school but the project canbe finished at home,another thing is that the summer projects that are made by teacher-designed is the best choice for all school, it make the student to be more creative, and the project will be more challenging and hard, and it will take a several time to completed.
