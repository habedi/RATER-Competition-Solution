Have you ever wanted to travel the oceans or visit different countries? In the Seagoing Cowboys program you can do all of that and help other countries while doing that. In the Seagoing Cowboys program you transport and take care of animals such as horses, young cows, and mules while they are shipping over seas. This program helps countries that need to be rebuilt after World War II.

When I was in the

Seagoing Cowboys program I had just gotten out of high school and had two part time jobs. When I got an offer to join i just couldn't resist. While trasporting the animals I got to go on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and get marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I thnk that seeing the Acropolis in Greece was the most special though. On your way back home from the trip you got to spend your times playing vollyball and baseball. We had table-tennis tournaments, boxed, fenced, and whitted.

I think anyone who is interested in traveling and sight seeing would like this job. It is manual labor but some of the things that I saw were spectacular. These reasons are why I think that you should join the

Seagoing Cowboys program.
