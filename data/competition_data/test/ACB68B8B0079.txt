Limiting car usage is great for people and the enviroment. There is less air pollution, less traffic jams, alot less stress, and people going out on the sidewalks enjoying the scenery and having fun! Limiting car usage can be very good in many ways!

If people limit car usage there will be less air pollution. Because cars use a non-resuable gas, (Gasoline and Desiel) they must be burned in order for the cars engine to power the car. After it burns and gets used up the exhaust pipe from the car leaks out the Carbon Monoxide that resides in the car after the gas is burned. When realised into the atmosphere, the gas damages it. Not allowing enough sun to get in, creating smog which is harmful for the human to breathe, and blocks vision for many people! SO if we stop using cars or at leaste limit them, then we won't have these problems that often or even AT ALL! If there were half the amount of cars driving around everyday then we would have a much more beautiful sky than we do now, also we would not have as much fog as some people do. Like Paris. They banned driving for a few days because of smog! "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" (Duffer Paragraph 1). So if we limit car usage we wouldn't have this problem!

If we limit or eliminate car usage in a certain area for a certain time, then people can go outside, enjoy the scenery and get some fresh air. Because of cars existing you don't really see much people walking on the street unless they don't have a car. People with cars just drive past everything and don't really look around, but people who don't have cars enjoy the scenery, get fresh air, and get excersice. It is proven that people who rather ride a bike or walk to a destination opposed to people who drive a car are more phisicaly fit than those who normally drive a car to their destination.

To clnclude, if people limit the car usage in the world there bwill be less pollution and all around more friendliness between all people and people will enjoy the life around them, rather then sitting in their cars!
