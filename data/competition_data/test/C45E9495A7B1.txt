So imagine being able to detect how someone is feeling, if their feeling sad, mad, happy, excited, or even really furious. Tell me would you like to be told what your facial expression is by just looking into your camera or computer. Well now we got a new software that has been devolped that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new software is called the "Facial Action Coding System" or as I like to call it the computer that decides how your feeling today as in like " 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. Here's how it works a computer constucts a 3-D model of the face, then all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans muscles. One movment of one or more muscles is called a "action unit". It just reconize the movments of the facial muscles.

In my opinion i think it's really stupid or as in some people like to call it non-valuable because the company who is creating these types of softwares instead of making something more resourceful as in like making a software program that in every gun when it's passed by a metal detector it gives an alert, As in like they should put a micro chip in a gun and whenever that gun passes through a metal detecor it alerts on a computer this goes for all the schools. But instead we are making facial expressions on cameras and computer just to tell us how mad, sad, or angry we are. As I can recall it helps us with what? Oh right it helps us fix our tone and atitude.

So as in my opinion I think that the software "Facial Action Coding System" is really non-valuable cause instead of helping the community there making useless programs. In all cause if they could make ther facial action coding system work to be able to reconize if your happy, mad or sad I think they could be able to create a way better resourceful program maybe even better a program that could help save lives. But you know that was my opinion and maybe some people really like it, but im just saying what I think a classroom full of students would say.
