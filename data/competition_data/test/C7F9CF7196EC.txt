Dear Principal:

I truly understand you on this policy, there is many reasons why this policy should be considered. Many students love sport willing to do anything to get in the sport team. By this, I'm saying that if they have low grades they will have to try harder to get in the sport. This will not only improve there grade but will help them get higher test scores.

Many students at my school love sports and are always talking about it. Now this means that they will do whatever is possible to get in the sport which as a result they have to have higher grades. If all students are in a sport and have good grades they will be able to have a good collage application.

On the other hand many people may think that a sport is a good way to keep a student healthy and active. But if this police it given not only will they be healthy but be motivative to keep their grades higher. This will help then throw out the school year.

I am very appreciated of you for taking time out of your day to read my letter. If you have any questions or comments feel free to send a letter or a call. this will defiantly be a good police in consideration. Again thank you so much!
