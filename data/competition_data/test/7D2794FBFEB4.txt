Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that you are contemplating on whether or not students should be required to perform acts of community service. As a former student, I believe that community service should be required by all middle school students. Today community service helps me greatly. With all of the stress of being "Mother Nature", it is very hard for me to clean and inspect each and every nook and cranny. My former friends OTHER_NAME, and OTHER_NAME make it harder and harder for this beautiful planet that we call Earth to survive.

Some people argue that students shouldn't be required to do complete acts of community service. They say that community service is for " janitors" and "convicts". I think that they are wrong! Those who are say nay to community service are just saying yes to global warming and pollution. Community service is not just an job for janitors and convicts, it is a deep statement of opinion. When you complete community service you're saying " I believe in bettering my country, my planet, and my life."

Another common argument you hear associated with community service is the time. It takes to much time out of your day, you don't have time to relax. How can you sit and say that? You're wasting time just standing there. OTHER_NAME and new batches of friends are making messes that I can't clean in a day, and instead of helping, you wonder how much time it will take out of your life. When you refuse to help by doing community service, you're just insisting that your life be cut short. Think about that the next time you worry about the time.

Who's to say that community service can't be fun? Don't knock it till you try it. Community service is a great way to meet new people who are also trying to better the earth. It not only helps clean the earth and lengthen your life span, it creates new bonds and friendships as well. I remember when I first met "Rain" and "Sun", they helped make clean up of OTHER_NAME and her gangs messes so much easier. My first act of community service in elementary school was picking up trash from our playground after field day, and I've been doing it ever since.

I know you may think, community service is boring, community service is for janitors and convicts, I won't be able to hang out with my friends if I do community service. You're wrong! Community service is a great way to meet people, it's a great way to lengthen you're life span, and a great way to clean up the planet. If this doesn't convince you that community service should be required for all students to graduate, nothing will. Please think about this not just for you, but for future generations. See you next month OTHER_NAME.

Sincerely,

Mother N
