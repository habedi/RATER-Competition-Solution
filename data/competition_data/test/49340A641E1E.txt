Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during their break. Students should get to choose the project they want because they will learn more and will enjoy doing a topic of their liking. Having a teacher choose could likely end up in failure to complete, due to the topic and student preference. Allowing them the freedom of choice will result in a higher pass rate and assurance of learning on break.

The first reason schools should let students choose is because the student will enjoy doing the project. A student will choose something that keeps them interested and entertained which will assure they complete and get a good grade on the project. Most teen students have a short attention span which could cause them to get bored and stop trying if they get a topic that isnt enjoyable for them. As a result in students doing the topic they enjoy, they focus more and can get it done easier

The second reason schools should let students choose is because they will learn more as they progress on the project. When students choose their own topic of their liking it proves they'll learn more the more researchÂ is done about that topic. A student may not know where to find specific information required if a teacher chose the topic since they wont know much or anything about it. research has shown that even lazy students learned more while on break because they got to choose a topic they enjoyed.

If students chose the topic then a student could already know everything about it which may result in them not learning more while on break. Students could have also done a previous project on the same topic they chose this time and they could remake it and result in learning nothing.

In conclusion, schools that require summer projects should allow students to design and choose the topic. Having this will result in the whole class completing the project and get a passing grade on it. Students will complete it easily and will know where to find the information without any issue. This will assure they have learned more and retained any information in their heads
