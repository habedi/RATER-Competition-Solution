Cell Phones are now seen as an essential item for millions of people. Throughout each day people need to use their phones for multiple reasons including, communicating with family members, answering phone calls from work, or using the GPS to drive to the nearest McDonalds. Smartphones make life simpler and even safer, but that is not always the case. Most people lack the discipline to peel away from their phone when put in situations where multitasking is not a good idea. For example, while driving the steering wheel needs all of your attention because a simple glance at your phone trying to text back your mom could cause a fatal accident. It is evident that texting while driving should be banned or at least states should be willing to put major restrictions to reduce the dangerous outcomes from using an electronic device while driving a vehicle. People should not be allowed to use their cell phones at any time while driving a vehicle because they are putting themselves at a higher risk to crash, cellsphones reduce the drivers ability to maintain focus, and phones are the leading cause of accidents in the highway.

People should not be allowed to use their cellphones while driving at any time due to the fact that it increases the likelihood of a car wreck. It is true, people all over the world are super busy and never enough time to get things done so they try to multitask. This leaves them to get things done while on the road. Most Americans are addicted to their phone as well and check their phone more times then needed while driving. According to a study made last year, "People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into an accident than those who drive while intoxicated." While this may seem crazy, something illegal such as drinking and driving is less dangerous than texting and driving but, it is a fact that cannot be ignored. Even though millions are told to not text and drive they continue to ignore the deadly warnings from participating in cellphone use while operating a vehicle yet once again making the wrong choice. Always remember that texting or using a cellphone while driving is extremely risky not only for yourself but for those in your car as well as vehicles around you.

In 2009, 5,474 lives were taken and 448,000 people got injured from car accidents from being distracted while driving, as stated by the government. The lives of innocent people are being taken every day because of a simple distraction. Car crashes are four times more common to take place while the driver is on their phones over any other causes. Different states have views on the laws that are being used about texting while driving. Utah has a law established stating that if a driver is texting while driving and crashes they will spend fifteen years in jail. Most people don't seem to realize how careless they can be while driving a car. Talking on a cell phone is not as dangerous as texting these days. While talking on the phone, it is easier to still keep focused on the road in front of the driver. When they look at their text messages, it's not possible to look in both directions at once, therefore all of their focus goes straight to the screen of the cell phone. The article "10 Terryfying facts about texting and driving'' by Drivers Alert states, "11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway." It's hard for all drivers, especially teenagers, to put down the cell phone and put their hands on the wheel, which results in many car crashes. That means the carelessness of any driver could end their life in seconds or even worse cause the death of others. While driving, the driver's main focus should never be their phone; it should be getting to their destination safely.

Texting and driving is the leading cause of crashes on the road. Most would imagine that it would be reckless driving by intoxicated people but that is not true. As stated previously, only 11 teenagers die every day due to the use of cellphones while driving and that doesnt even include adults or other bystanders. Hence, the reason why most states and countries have declared cellphone use while driving illegal. Unfortunately, the rate of crashes caused by cell phone use has only gone down 4%. Furthermore, did you know that 1 out of 4 people die from crashes that are involved with cellular device usage. Most of you would agree that you are a good driver and that texting does not impact your driving skills, but statistics show otherwise. Imagine a scenario, where you are driving and receive a text from your mother and all you have to do is respond yes or no. Studies have shown that it takes a person at least 5 seconds to reply. If you were going 55 miles per hour that's like driving half a the length of a football field. Anything could happen in those 5 seconds and this is probably the case in most crashes every single day making this one of the leading causes in the world.

There is no question, vehicles and cell phones both are definitely important objects in every person's life. Sometimes people even use both at the same time just because they can without thinking about the consequences. Bad things will always come from cellphone usage while operating a vehicle. No matter how many laws are placed, tools made to lessen the contact between you and your phone the only actual way to not allow your phone to distract you is to put it away. It is understandable, if there is an emergency and you need to pick up the phone but, if it's just a text from your mom with no urgency all you have to do is simply wait. It only takes considering the possibilities of terrible things that can happen by choosing to prioritize your safety as well as others. It is never too hard to practice using your phone less while driving, and most importantly if you have children or teens who see you on your phone while driving they might think it's okay to do it as well. In that case you might not crash that day, but in the future your kids who saw you do it choose to do it as well. There are various ways and solutions to make cell phone usage close to none, use them to keep yourself safe. So, next time your phone rings, make sure to send the right message by not sending that text.
