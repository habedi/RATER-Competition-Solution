To whom it may concern;

You have recently put forward the idea of making community service mandatory for all students in our school.

I think that would be a great idea because it would make all of us more proud of our community.

I think this because if you are outside cleaning up a park or a lake you will feel that you have genuinely made a difference in your community.

Community service has other beneficial effects aw well.

One of them is that it instills a strong work ethic in people my age who may not have a very strong work ethic.

Having a strong work ethic helps you throughout your life and it is definitely going to help us get through high school.

Community service also does, by nature, help the community.

There are many different kinds of community service in the world and they all help communities differently but in the end they all make your community a better place to live.

They might make it cleaner, safer or just prettier but they still just make our community a better place.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
