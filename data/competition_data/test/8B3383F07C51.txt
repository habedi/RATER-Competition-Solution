To Principal,

I think that students should help by doing community service because if they don't then people including them could get sick from nasty things like trash that should be in the trash cans. Everybody should do this and i don't see that people would not. If you don't, bad things will happen. the people who want to do community service, that's great and it shows appreciation on your part. The people who don't want to do community service, that's bad. Your not only making the environment worse, your letting the nasty trash (Litter) hurt people including you. I think if the people who wont help are not really my friends because if they were real friends they would help the environment. They should be happy for helping, If they do they will save a whole lot than a few people, They will save the whole WORLD. I know some people don't want to go outside and do work, there to busy sitting down on the couch watching tv and going on the computer, eating junk food etc... but this is the world at stake, Just get up, go outside and help save the world. I hope your listening and work hard from now on, your not just helping yourself your helping the WORLD.
