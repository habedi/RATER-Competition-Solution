I agree with this decision because there are some students that don't have that many friends although they would like to make some new friends. Also if students wants to stay in shape they could participate in a sport that they like want to try out for once. For example they could play soccer, football, basketball, ultimate Frisbee. Plus if students don't want to do any sports they could cheer the sports team if they have a game. Or there are many other options to do.

If students does not like the activity they could go with a teacher or a club that discover new information that could help them in the future. For example if they went to a club that talks about robotics,math, or science they could use that if they would get that job. Also it could help them in college if they wanted to take this path this could help them already have an idea of the information. That could help the students get a great job when they are older. which would help them if they were growing up in a low income family.

Plus if the student is already in a team,and they want to get better they could practice in the sport if the school allows the sport to be played. Also if they had a friend, or someone that plays the same sport they play they could practice together and benefit from it. By making a new friend or by practice with a new way of looking, And it could help the student or students get ready for the school try out. By having everyone do a extracurricular activity it would help people with a problem with they lives, like with overweight or problems at home it would give a way to have a bright future in the end. even if the student comes from a good background it will still benefit them.

Finally I truly agree that everyone should do a extracurricular activity to help them with making new friends or even getting better at a sport,or just practicing their sport it will help them in many ways that they don't even know yet.
