Dear Principal,

I am one of your students in your school and due to my opinion i agree to Policy 1. Us, students should have a right to bring our cell phones to school incase of emergency, or to call our parents after school for any type of arrangements. I agree that we should not have our cell phones out during class except for lunch. During lunch some kids might want to take pictures to have a memory of that special occasion or regular day. I also agree that when a class has free time, we should have a right to have our cell phones out or any other type of device as long as we are not doing anything educational at the moment. I believe Policy 1 is better but if most of the students get a little out of hand with this privilege, i agree that you are to change the policy to Policy 2 to punish the students who has taken advantage. Also if you are seeing deep changes in some of the students grades you are gladly to take this Policy from them because cell phones are a huge distraction to us, kids. But besides the negative, i would appreciate if you went with Policy 1 . Please and Thank you. :)
