Have you ever come home from school and been bored, because you have nothing to do? Fortunately enough for you, there are tons of extracurricular activities available. I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first reason I believe this, is that students are able to try a new activity and meet new people. In addition to that, students can learn teamwork and make friends from an extracurricular. Finally, students participating in an extracurricular learn how to balance school work on on top of their activity.

When students try new activities, they can discover things about themselves and new people with common interests. Students may discover a talent or interest in something that they never knew they had. For example, if a person has never kicked a soccer ball, then they will not know whether they're good at it or they like it. Furthermore, even if students come to find that they don't like their extracurricular, they can still use this experience in the future. Just like when a person tries a new food, if that individual doesn't like it, then they will remember. The students can then use their knowledge to avoid what they don't like in the future. Last, it is beneficial to try a new activity, because you may meet someone you don't know who has similar interests to yours. Meeting these new people with common interests can lead to new friendships, that never would have happened. Trying a new extracurricular allows students to learn more about themselves and meet new people.

Participating in group activities is very important to students. For example, teamwork can be learned by practicing and working with a team in an extracurricular. In an extracurricular it is crucial that team members trust, rely, and work with each other to achieve the common goal. Secondly, using this teamwork to collaborate and accomplish goals, can lead to new friendships. When a student learns to trust and work with a team member within a extracurricular, they can also trust and collaborate with that person outside of the extracurricular. Last but not least, being able to work in a group is a very important skill that people look for when they are hiring for jobs. Companies look for teamwork in their employees, because co-workers need to be able to collaborate and respect each other to do their jobs efficiently. Activities that schools offer teach an important lesson about teamwork, that can create new friendships and be used outside of school.

Partaking in an extracurricular and school at the same time has many benefits. The first of those being, that participating in an activity and school at the same time teaches students the manage their time. Adding an extracurricular on top of schoolwork can only be done if the student learns to use all of their time wisely. This time management allows a person to do more things they love to do. If a person can be efficient and not procrastinate on things they have to do, they will have leftover time to do whatever they want. The final reason a student should attend school and do an extracurricular, is that time managementÂ is a necessary life skill that students must learn. In the future students may need to balance a family, work, and make time for themselves all at the same time. Participating in school and an extracurricular teaches students a valuable life lesson about time management, that can allow these students to do what they love.

I think that all students in school must partake in at least one extracurricular. I think this, because students can get new experiences and meet new people, while trying a new activity. Not only that, activities students participate in can teach teamwork that can lead to new friendships. My last reason for believing this is that, taking part in school and extracurricular activities gives students a lesson about how to manage time wisely. I believe that all schools should require students to partake in an extracurricular.
