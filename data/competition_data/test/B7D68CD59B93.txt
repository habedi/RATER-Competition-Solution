Most schools have extracurricular activities, such as playing sports or working on the yearbook. Most students enjoy these activities and are grateful to have the chance to participate in them. In the majority of schools, a student is not required to take part in one of these activities. However, if the principal of a school were to decide that all students must participate in one, then their decision should be supported because the extracurricular activities will help students find new interests, they will allow them to meet people with similar interests, and skills such as teamwork will be encouraged.

One reason in support of a principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities is that they help people find new interests. Often times, a student may assume that a certain activity is boring or a waste of their time. However, this is impossible to know until it is tried out. After trying it out, the student may realize that it is fun, and a great way to spend their free time. Sometimes, a student may simply think that they do not have the time to participate in a club or a sport after school. However, after doing it once and realizing how much they enjoy the activity, they may reconsider whether or not they do not have much time. Both of these scenarios result in the student having a good time, and this enjoyment can only be credited to the principal, as they are the reason why the student participated in an activity. So, by being forced to be in a club or sport, students will expand their amount of hobbies and interests.

Another reason why the principal made a good decision is that it will allow students to meet those with similar interests. If everyone has to do an extracurricular activity, they will all go to the one that they are most interested in. For example, those who like taking photos may go to yearbook club. Now, all of those who have the same hobbies are together, and they will most likely become friends, as they can bond over their interests. This was only possible because of the principal's decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities.

The last reason why the decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities was a good one is that it encourages skills, such as teamwork or persistence. In most sports, such as basketball or soccer, teamwork is a skill that is always used. The players must communicate with each other to make the best play. They must encourage each other, and keep them from getting nervous. Teamwork will also be used when students grow up. Many jobs will require employees to work in a team to complete their work. By practicing this skill earlier, students will be better prepared for when they grow up. Another skill that is encouraged is persistence. If one gives up after facing a problem, no work can get done. For example, if one is taking part in a mathematics club, they will have to solve a variety of problems. Some may seem like they have no solution. However, if the student gives up after they cannot find a solution, they will not learn anything. Also, they will be ill-prepared for when they grow up and face a myriad of other challenges. If, when they face these challenges, they just give up, they will not be able to do all they are supposed to do. By participating in extracurricular activities, students will not grow up without these skills, and can instead accomplish everything they need to, and more. The one who is responsible for this is the principal, who made students take part in these activities.

In conclusion, a principal's decision to require students to participate in extracurricular activities is a good one because students will find new interests, make new friends, and build skills that are absolutely necessary in adult life. By taking part in these activities, students will both enjoy themselves, and they will gain the skills needed throughout their life.Â
