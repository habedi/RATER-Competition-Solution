If you could join the program would you? I would join the program because of site seeing, help many people and animals in need, and to interacte with different animals from across the world.

During your daring trips around the world you visit places like Europe and China or any where else. You may incounter many people living in that area and experience the culture and foods. Just like when luke marveled at the Panama Canal. There are many famous places around the world and you could see many of them that not a lot of people see in their life time.

Many people across the world need a lot of help due to disasters that has happened to theemor in their country. Also the animals and not just the humans need our help because they are important creatures to this world.

And when out in some country helping you could have to take care of many types of animals that live there, and that you may have never seen before.

In concluson you should join the program because of site seeing, help people from across the gloab, and the chance to interacte with many animals. So in the future if you have the chance to join i'm telling you to.
