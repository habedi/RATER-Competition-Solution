Are you guys wondering about joining a program where you can take care of animals and travel a lot? Well, you guys should join Seagoing Cowboys. It really is an awesome place. Trust me, you are going to love it there!

My experience there was very unique and full of adventures. I made a lot of animal friends. I would recommend this trip to anyone who likes to travel and likes to take care of animals.

One reason you people would like to go there is because there are a lot of animals there. Some of them including horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. So, if you like animals, you should join Seagoing Cowboys.

Another reason you should go there is because as a Seagoing Cowboy, I have traveled overseas many times and the reason is because of cattle boat trips. I have went on them nine times. I have also seen Europe and China. Although, seeing the Acropolis in Greece was a special visit for me. Also taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with a lot of water. I also toured a castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. So that is another reason I enjoyed joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Last but not the least, I loved when we played games. We usually played after the animals were unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. We also played Table-tennis, fencing, boxing. We read too, these were all the things we did to help pass time.

I hope that when some of you join Seagoing Cowboys, you have as much fun as I did and hopefully you return safe and sound from Seagoing Cowboys. Thank you very much for considering to join Seagoing Cowboys!
