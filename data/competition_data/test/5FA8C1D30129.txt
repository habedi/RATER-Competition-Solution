In today's world, schools accross the world are modernizing in many different ways. In fact, the concept of going to school itslef is changing drastically. With new innovations and technologies, some students have the ability to attend school without physically attending school. This new method of learning is made possible by the concept of "distance learning", which allows students to attend classes either from their home by way of online or through video conferencing. All students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home through the internet because it gives students the opportunity to learn and be engaged in the classroom from anywhere, it is a more modern and efficient way of learning, and it opens the doors for the creation of international schools, which could make schools much more culturally diverse.

One reason why students would benefit from being able to take classes from home is because it would allow students to have the opportunity to travel and have worldly experiences, while still being engaged in the classroom. The possibility for students to be able to learn from anywhere is very promising. It would allow for students to gain new experiences on a global scale, while still learning the core subjects in school. For example, students who are incredibly interested in the Classics could be in Italy or Greece further pursuing their interests in this relam, while still being engaged in their school work and lessons from their school at home by means of these video conferences or online classes. If a student were to go visit family in another location, having the ability to take online classes or use video conferences to keep up with their schoolwork would also be incredibly beneficial because it would prevent them from falling behind. These are just a few circumstances in which having access to online classes or video conferences would be beneficial for students; they would give all students the opportunity to learn from anywhere.

Another reason why it would be beneficial for students to attend classes anywhere by means of the internet or video conferencing is because it could open the door for the creation of international schools. If students had the ability to attend classes without physically being in the classroom, it could allow for schools globally to collaborate and intermix. Students from South Africa could be enrolled in the same classes as students from Japan or the United States. Having the ability to crease internationally mixed classrooms would greatly benefit students; it would make classrooms much more culturally, racially, and ethnically diverse, which would overall enrich the experience for all of the studnets. Students would have the opportunity to engage with students from various backgrounds and to also learn about other cultures and places around the world. While the students would still be separated physically by thousands of miles in some cases, they would be unified in the online classrooms and would have the opportunity to get to know indiviaduals who they would likely have never met otherwise. This experience would overall allow students to further develop their understanding of not only other cultures, but also of the world.

Although there are many advantages to this new method of attending school, there are also some notable disadvantages. Giving students the opportunity to attend classes from home using the internet or video conferences could give some studnets less of an incentive to physically attend school. Some students who don't particualrly enjoy school may see this as an opportunity to not go to school. There are also notable benefits from physically attending school; it allows students to learn life skills, create relationships, and it gives students the traditional, true "school" experience. Although these can be seen as reasons why implementing the opportunity for attending school using the internet may be a bad idea, the benefits that this would provide for students are far more important and enriching.

All students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home through the internet because it would allow students to learn and be engaged in the classroom from anywhere accross the world and and it opens the doors for the creation of international schools, which would make schools much more culturally diverse. As the world modernizes and people's ways of life change, schools will also change. Giving students the opportunty to attend classes without physically being in the classroom by means of the internet or video conferencing would be an improvemment to schools and would allow them to develop and modernize along with the rest of the world as it becomes increasingly technological.
