I am writing this letter regarding the cell phone policy's.

I would appreciate policy one. Sometimes we need our cell phones incase of emergency's and things happening at home. I think cell phones would really help schools now to keep kids focused. Since they would know they don't have to sneak and text students can wait till lunch or there brake, and they would also stay focused. Students should have to turn in there phone's as entering into the class room and get them as being dismissed. So it will not even be a temptation to sneak, and if they happen to get caught principle should keep it till the end of the day . They also should not be used in the library if someone is studying if not they should be able to use them to look up books, and to see what there book is about. Some libraries do not have computers for student use. I hope this letter is very convincing , and hope we get policy 1.

Sincerely ,
