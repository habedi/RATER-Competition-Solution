Dear Principle,

I think students should do community service to help improve our school and town. Our town isn't the best looking town, there's garbage on the streets, windows broken, and old, rundown buildings. Some students actually want to help, I believe you should make it where we have time to do this. We only have around 3 ours from the time we get home to do community service. School should be let out earlier at least one day a week, I'm not asking for much maybe an hour or two earlier.

I think we could get enough students to sign a petition to let us out earlier. Sure some students may take advantage of this but we need more time. You could also give us a class for community service make it an elective here, an after school club would also be useful. Community service is very important, if we had enough people we can make a huge difference.

People in our school are concerned about its appearance. I think we should make it a project to paint the school and rebuild some of the older building. We can do a fundraiser to help buy the paint and building materials. If there is any money left we could either donate it or give it to the sports for our school.

The citizens of this town should put more effort into improving it. We can easily make a difference with the right tools and determined people. What will this town come to if some kind of improvement isn't made? I hope you take this idea into consideration because a lot of people are worried about this issue just as I am. Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
