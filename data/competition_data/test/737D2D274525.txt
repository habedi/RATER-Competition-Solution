I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It is very fun, who wouldn't want to travel around the world and go to many new places? Who knows? You might meet some nice people and make new friends? I have, I've met people from places I never thought I'd go to before. But I did and here I am. Telling you that if you get on this boat. There is no turning back. But trust me, you wont regret it.

When you go on this trip to many new places. You get to meet new poeple. Now they may not look the same, act the same, or even smell the same. But that doesn't mean that they are any different from us. Most of the people I've met are really nice and caring. They don't talk hateful to you or anything. Even the people on the boat are nice. They have manners, they will respect you and everyone else on the boat.

Now, I've been to many different places before. Nine in fact! The places that you go to are amazing. So many have different languages and different cultures! For example China. Now that place was bueatiful! Somany bright colors. They even have a different language!

I've gotten to see things I've never seen before. Not to brag or anything but of all the places I've ever seen. They all had so many different landmarks. It's kinda like their culture. They all have something different. Which is what is so cool about being on that boat. When you go places you see so many new things. It's amazing!

Now have you made up your mind? If you haven't then I guess that is you loss. But trust me on this one thing. When you get on that boat, you feel free. Something that you don't feel when your stuck in town all the time. But if you decide to go, then good for you. But it isn't all fun in games. You have to work too. Now it's either you get on that ship or you stay here. Your choice, not mine.
