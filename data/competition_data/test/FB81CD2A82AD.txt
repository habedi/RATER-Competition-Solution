Our beloved principal has decided that students attending this excellent school must be a member of a least one extracurricular activity, and I am in complete support of this idea. The benefits of this proposal are exquisite and will not only help students, but parents as well. Some students may think staying after school would be an annoyance, but there is something for everyone after the last bell. Whether students join a football team or a math club, many children will have a bright smiles on their faces when they're participating in an activity of their choice. All students should be required to participate in a minimum of one extracurricular activity because it will enhance the minds and muscles of students, teach students to be active citizens, and assist working parents.

To begin with, executing this decision will strengthen the minds of many students. Fun clubs like the Drama Club and Art Club promote out of the box thinking and creativity. A vast majority of students would benefit from these teachings because they work a part of a student's brain that isn't always challenged throughout the school day. Also, clubs are great way to introduce new career paths to children. For example, the Robotics Team introduces students to the growing world of STEM. Practicing STEM from a young age, especially in an after school club, is a spectacular way to increase the number of future engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, which would heavily benefit our technology advancing planet.

In addition to clubs, students would also have more opportunity to join sports teams. Some parents cannot afford to pay for a recreational or travel sports team, so this required extracurricular activity could help a number of less fortunate students participate in a sport of their choice. This requirement could also promote health benefits for students. With an extracurricular activity as requirement, some students who usually don't exercise may join a sports team, leading to an overall healthier school. Furthermore, with more students participating in school sports, there will most likely be more supporters at games. This could result in more school spirit and in total a more enthusiastic student body.

Also, requiring students to participate in after school activities could teach majority of our students to become good, active citizens. Good citizens participate in local government. This new requirement teaches students to participate in extracurricular activities, consequently many of them will form a positive habit of being active in their communities. Children form habits and learn many critical skills in their grade school years, so teaching them to start participating now could greatly impact the future of community activity. To elaborate, some students may join student council. Student council is superb preparation for future government jobs students might hold. Therefore, requiring students to become members of at least one extracurricular activity could lead to a better society with more active citizens.

Lastly, this decision could assist hard working parents. Most parents work 9:00am to 5:00pm, and if their children are at school for an additional hour for an extracurricular activity, they would have the luxury of being able to get all of their work done, and pick up their children from school on time. Mothers and fathers of many students work extremely hard to provide for their families. With an extra hour to spare on a day their children stay after school, parents could potentially have a more zen car ride, free from worry of being late to the car pick up line. As a result of having additional time to get to the school building, parents may drive slower. This could lead to safer roads with fewer accidents.

To conclude, the principal's decision to require students to participate in one extracurricular activity is beneficial to the student body and their parents. The decision helpful because it will introduce new ways of learning to many students, promote exercise and school spirit, teach students to participate in their communities, and help working mothers and fathers. This idea could also make the roads safer. As a student, member of many clubs, and a car rider, I believe this decision will make our school better for students, and make our school unique from others. Requiring students to participate in a minimum of one after school activity was a great decision made by our principal and should be supported by all of the amazing students that make out school special.
