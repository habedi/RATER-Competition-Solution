Hey you! Do you want do something good for your school, or even your community? Well it sounds like a plan. Our principal here at Generic_Name, has decided, that all students must participate, in at least one extracurricular activity. With this decision I agree for three reasons. I agree because it will keep kids busy, out of trouble, and help some of us with our social life.

Being active everyday is a huge importance in life, especially fro us and while we are young. And sitting at home on social media is not going to help, so join a sport, to keep you active for at least an 1 hour or more. If you are going through some personal issues, doing an extracurricular activity can take your mind off of that. So for these reasons keeping our bodies busy is good alternative, rather than being bored.

To have a well organized goals set throughout life, is very organized. If you are someone who gets in trouble a lot, think about setting goals for yourself. For instance, you could set a goal for ways you can keep yourself out of trouble and even getting negativity out of your life. Therefore doing the right thing is never wrong, so do something for the school, that could help you set a better pathway for your future goals. Sometimes there are people in your life that could be a bad influence on you, and to let them go out of your life is better for you than them being there and ruining your bright future.

In high school having your career plan is a good start in life. With the start of your career path, the first skill with that is communication. As a result of a good career, having a social life in high school is important. Joining Student Council Association (SCA), playing a sport, and presenting a project in class, is all where great communication can come from. For example, if you are in the SCA you have to deliver important upcoming events, new changes, and plenty more information for your peers. Now think to yourself. . . " Do I want a great career or not?'

So with the principal's decision I agree to his decision he has made. Just think about it, doing more is always better including being occupied, staying out of trouble, and boosting your social life. The reasoning for my agreement is because it shows some people do actually care about us, and to me I find that very important.
