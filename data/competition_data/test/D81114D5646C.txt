Dear Principal,

I am aware that you might have a good reason for not allowing students with at least a B grade average to participate in school sporting events or other activities, and I respect your right to an opinion. However, as a student I find your decision unjust and an act of discrimination to students with lower grades. This rule demeans students without the capability of achieving higher grades. This also denies the students any chance of achieving an athletic scholarship to a high school or college. So not only do you deny them sports, you deny them an opportunity for higher education.

I understand that you might find logic in your decision, but we, the students, do not. As a principal, your first and foremost priority is to your students education and well being. Denying students sports will severely decrease a student's time being active. As you know, obesity has sky rocketed in this country over the past few years, and it happens mainly because some children are denied the opportunity to be active in the first place.

Sports and activities cost money, and I understand that. I am aware that what money that might be payed to participate might not cover the initial expenditure. I think, however that if the school is in fact running low on funds, restricting those below a B average from participating is too selective and unfair. In my opinion, if you are to restrict some from sports and activities, why not restrict all?

I sincerely hope you consider these consequences as you make your decision

Yours truly,
