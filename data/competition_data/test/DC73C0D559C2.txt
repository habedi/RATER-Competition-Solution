Extracurricular activities help distract students from doing terrible things. What if some students have to go to church after school? Or what if some students have other chores to accomplish after school. If we give each and every student at least 1 extracurricular activity, then all of those students who have something else to do apart from extracurricular activities would have to change their schedule due to the fact that they will not be able to complete their objectives after school. This represents my position of disagreeing the idea of giving students at least 1 extracurricular activities.

Primarily, students have the choice to participate in extracurricular activities, if they choose to not participate in extracurricular activities then that would mean that they have other personal activities or objectives after school. I chose to rarely participate in any extracurricular activities due to the fact that I have a lot of chores to accomplish at home after school and having 1 or more extracurricular activities may impact my daily schedule and I would have to accomplish my chores at a later time than usual. If students do chose to participate in extracurricular activities then that would mean that they have already planned their schedule for their days.

The second reason is that if some students have their days planned and their schedule ready for the day, but if we give those students 1 or more extracurricular activities, then they would have to rearrange their schedule and replan their days again to squeeze in the extracurricular activities into their schedule. And if some students rearrange their schedule then that means that they would have to do their personal activities later than usual. If school ends at 2:15 and I have to go to church at 3:00, I would finish church at around 6:00 and have 3 more hours to do my home work and do my chores around the house. But if I add 1 1/2 more hours for soccer practice then I would leave school at 2:15, go to soccer practice at 3:00 and finish at 4:30, go to church for 3 hours and then come home at around 7:30, I do my homework and do my chores for 2 hours and now its past 9:00 and I am still doing my chores.

In conclusion, students that must choose an extracurricular activity mustve already have a choice of what they would like to do and already must have a planned schedule of their days. But their comes the risk of those 1 or more extracurricular activities will may impact their schedules for personal activities or objectives.
