Home school, this is a very popular subject nowadays. This is a program that benefits a lot of children around the world that for different circumstances they can't attend to a school building. But what happens when a child has the physical and mental capacity to attend school but still decides to have home school, are they going to have the same benefits as the rest of students that attend to school?

Every child has the right to be educated. There exists plenty of qualities and values that a student can develop in a classroom such as: honesty, friendship, respect, leadership, etc. These are just some of all the attributes a student can gain by attending to school, but one of the most important qualities that a human can learn is the interaction with others. This is because the world is based on that, every single day people interact with other people and learn form each other, this is the way the world works.

In school, students have to interact with their classmates and teachers day by day. There are group assignments were teachers put you in a group were nobody knows each other so they can work together and hopefully build a good friendship. Sports in school are also a great way to interact with others, teachers encourage students to participate in sport activities after school. If the student doesn't like sports there also are different clubs in school in which students can participate.

In conclusion the home school program can teach all the knowledge a student needs such as sciences or maths but, it doesnt teach the values and attributes a human needs. The future generations that the world need are correct people with good values that will help the progress of the world.
