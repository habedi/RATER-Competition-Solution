Driving essay

I believe that people shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any kind of capacity while driving because not only is it bad but, it's also dangerous for you and whoever else is in the car with you.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed.

Many brands of new cars are equipped with technology that connects your cell phone to your vehicle's stereo system. If you drive an older model vehicle, invest in a cell phone with Bluetooth technology and voice recognition technology that will allow you to send and receive messages hands-free. The reason why I am saying this is because if you could speak to your phone to do things it would be easier for you to drive on the road.

Everyone already knows how bad it is to text and drive and that it can cause accidents, but I never told you how many there has been. In 2011, 1.3 million automobile accidents were caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving make you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident.

After all the bad things that can happen, I believe that nobody should be allowed to use cell phones while doing any operating in a vehicle. Also, in 2015, 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers using cell phones on U.S. roads. The bottom line is that texting and driving is seriously dangerous so put the down the phone. Keep your eyes on the road and stay safe.
