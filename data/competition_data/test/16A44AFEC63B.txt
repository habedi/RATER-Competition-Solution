Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think we should go with Policy 1, because we should have the right to have our cell phones out anytime of the day but class time. we should be able to have our phones out at break and lunch time. It would help some people like me , so like i want have to we worried about a paper due today that is very hard, but if we have our phones then we can have a break from our work and not be worried about that paper.

i also think that having cell phones at school is helpful by a calculator and calling your friend asking what was our homework last night is they have forgotten . another great way to have a phone at school is like if you are hurt or other people around your are hurt or in a injury then we would be able to go and call for help if needed. so i think after all this , here would be thinks to think of for having a cell phone here at school.
