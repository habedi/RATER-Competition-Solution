Peoples emotions can be hard to detect most times. Personally, my friends have gotten very good at faking emotions. Detecting how someone really feels in nearly impossible for the human brain. For example, in the article it states that the Mona Lisa is, "83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry." Being able to detect all of those emotions in just looking or talking to someone just isn't as easy as it seems. Thats why they came up with "the Facial Action Coding System." This system has been developed to improve the accuracy in perceiving ones emotions.

Frst, the way this system will work is when the computer constructs a 3-D compter model of a face. The computer will be able to detect the emotion of a person when they see the muscles in their face. To be able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom will be very benificiary when it comes to how they feel about the thing the school is teaching them. If we continue to advance in technology like we have, then using the computers for lessons will be able to detect weather the child is interested or not. The article states that, " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomming confused or bored." That way when a child is confused, for those who are too scared to ask for help, the teacher could be alerted and try their best to help the child or maybe even change lessons.

Secondly, the computer system could also be very helpful in a school because of teenage kids and their problems. If a student is feeling very down, then the computer could detect that and try to get help for them. In the world today there are many kids who suffer from depression and anxiety, sometimes school can be too much for them. Therefore, when doing school work if the computer can detect the sadness or overwhelming confusion causing their anxiety to rise it could help them out a lot. The article states that, "In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth, while a fake smile the mouth is stretched sideways, using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius." This would help the computer detect kids from being actually happy, or just faking it for everyone else.

Third, the computer system could help with kids who struggle with anger. Maybe school makes them angry, or they struggle with the work. With the school fights in the past, and future, i belive this would help detect how kids feel. The computer could watch what the child proceeds to look up on the internet, while also detecting how the child feels. This way, if a child shows signs of harm to themselves or to others, the computer could inform the school and try to give help to the kid. I believe this would only improve the safety of schools while also offering help to the ones that need it.

Fourth, I believe the computer system could help those of us who tend to get very bored or tired. This way when a child is bored or tired the teacher has a way of fixing the problems, or doing more interesting ideas to help you stay focused. Personally, i tend to get very bored when school comes up to topic, so if my teacher had a way of making it interesting for me that would be awesome! I also tend to get very tired so if my teacher is alerted of a child getting sleepy, we could do exercise or stretches to help wake us up.

This computer system would help school coorporations tremendlously because of all the problems kids go through. I believe that every school computer should have this sytem, because i think the techers could have a chance to keep children interested and awake. This could possibly improve attendance and graduation percetages. Getting a kid engaged and interested can be very difficult but i belive this stystem would help a lot! As the article states, " Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!" Truly amazing and helpful!
