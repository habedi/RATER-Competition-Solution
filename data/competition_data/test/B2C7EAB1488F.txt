Online Classes

Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing and i think it is not a good option for students because it can affect their studies.

When students take online classes, they don't understand everything. Subjects like science and maths can be harder for some of them because they can't learn everything online. When students do not have any teacher who is watching them during their quiz or test they can easily cheat. Online classes can affect their skills for example, when a student will work online he can't work in groups and he can't take part in class activities.

Online classes can take away different kind of opportunities from students, they can miss class field trips and class games like kahoot,bingo,picklers etc. By taking online classes students might have lack of confidence or in their future they will be shy to talk with their colleagues;however,due to some medical problems some students can't go to school because of that they need online classes which can help them to take either in home or in hospital. Recently my younger brother got a bone marrow transplant due to that doctors told him not to go to crowded area or in a school because his immune system is recovering from transplant. Right now he is taking online classes at Apex from home and it has saved him from being failed in his grade.

In the end i will just say one thing that everything have advantages and disadvantages but it help us to come out from tough situations or put us in a tough situations. We can't say what should be their or not because it helps some people and does not help others. Everyone understand that taking online classes have advantages and disadvantages so no one can decide that their should be online classes or not.
