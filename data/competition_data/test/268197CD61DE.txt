Are you for or against the development for driverless cars? Me personality, i'm against it. Can you honestly trust these cars 100%, they have your life in their hands. Even tho in the article it says there is an alert that lets the driver take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with comlicated traffic issues. I still wouldn't trust it, maybe you take advantage of it driving by its self. Then you start doing other things such as texting, playing games on your phone, or looking for something in the back seat. You really trust that car enough to stop paying attention to the road and others around you. So what if something does happen and you crash into something or get into a accident.

But the car never alerted you to take over, maybe the technology failed. So now you're injured from trusting a "driverless car". That you should of never trusted in the first place, especially with your life. There's no promises that this car isn't gonna mess up or make a mistake. So many things can go wrong with this car, because there is so much technology. Even if the technology doesn't fail, what if there is another driver that is driving reckless. Unfortuately you just so happen to be at the wrong place, at the wrong time. So you get hit by that driver, but will you get warned by the car that the car was even coming. In the article it didn't say anything about the car alerting you when another car is coming at you.

These cars can't stop everything from happening, it just might be the cause of something bad happening. The car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to alert the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. What if it doesn't notify you, not all technology is perfect. Almost anything can go wrong, they make you think that it's so perfect with no problems. But that's because they just tell you the positive things about the car and nothing about the negatives. Such as what could happen if the car does mess up or the technology does fail.

They're not gonna tell you things like that, because they want you to buy the car. Which you most likely will and you'll trust that car to drive by its self. I wouldn't trust this car one bit, because they're still working on it. So you know for a fact it has problems and could mess in any way, at any point of time. Never let techology take over something that you should be doing everyday. Also that car may not have the driving skills that you have. They say techology can do more than humans, well driving is definately a humans job.

Driving shouldn't be handled by technology, because its a everyday thing for humans. we know what to do and how to do it. Technology just could make a mistake and your like is in stake. Because you trusted some technology with your life. What if you do get in an accident in this car, is it the drivers fault or the manuafacturer? Driving is for humans and a human everyday thing, lets keep it that way.
