Should students be forced to do an extra activity outside of normal school?

I Believe that kids should be forced to do at leastÂ one extra school activity, because doing an activity can be fun, It helps you try new things, and it can be beneficial later on in life.

Doing an extra activity outside of school can be fun.

When being forced to do at least on extra activity, you get to choose which activity you may want to do.

People may say that if you are forced to do an extra activity, you may have to do something you dislike.

But the principal is giving you a choice between different activities, like if someone likes art, they can do art class, or if someone likes sports, they can do a sport.

The point of these activities are to give you something that you enjoy.

Instead of sitting all day after school on the couch, you can be out doing something that can make you a better person.

Being forced to do an extra activity helps you try new things.

When someone is forced to try something new, they will be experiencing new challenges, and they might not realize they really enjoy it.

Some of the pro sports players from every sport were forced to do that sport by a parent or guardian.

If they were not forced to play that sport, they would not realize how good they are at the that sport.

Being forced to try something new can make you a more rounded person as well, which will better you in the future.

Being forced to do an extra activity can benefit you later on in life.

If someone chooses art as their extra activity, and in the class they found out they are really good at drawing, can help you find a job later on in life.

"Trying new stuff is easier when you're still a kid."

Is a quote which means its best to learn new stuff as a kid, when you still have all those years to work on the stuff you want to.

Another example is if you're taking a sport as you extra activity, and you are really good at the sport, colleges will be watching and may want to give you a scholarship because you are really good at that sport.

Doing good in a extra activity, can have a large impact on your future life.

I believe that kids should be forced to do an extra activity outside of school because doing an extra activity can be fun, being forced to try an extra activity helps you try new things, and being forced to do an extra activity can benefit you later on in life.

These are the reasons why I believe that kids should be forced to do at least one extra school activity.
