Dear Principal,

To me policy 2 is a better idea then policy 1. Kids shouldn't be allowed to use their phones at school because it can get them distracted. Having phones at school can make kids have lower grades because your taking away time for them to learn and become physical. With kids using their phones during lunch they might now be active, they'll just be sitting down texting or talking with their friends. Even if you tell them to turn their phones off during class it still will effect our learning experience. When kids have their phones on you don't know what they're doing. They might be bullying other kids or spreading rumors through texts. A lot of kids might disagree with my opinion, but its for us to have a better education. It's best talking to someone in person then having to text them and not be able to see what they want to say. If you let them have phones at school you could make them feel like they could do anything. If kids don't have phones at school at all we could all focus better and actually learn things. Education is the key to a successful career and it helps you have a wonderful life when your older. Cell phones should only be used for what they were made for which is for contacting other people, and not for games, rumors, or for sending text messages. Some people don't have phones too, so they may be forced to buy a phone because everyone has one. Plus it can effect their life at home to. With kids talking 24/7 on the phone their phone bill will keep increasing and it can make their parents go insane. When kids go to school they will think its another place where they can hang out. Many parents may disagree to this too. They don't want their kids to be doing mischief, they want their kids to have a great job when they are adults. That's the reason why they put them in school. Kids will probably be texting instead of studying, and when they take a test they will be under pressure. Overall I think we shouldn't have phones at school at all. It's best if we keep it the way it is now, because all the schools are doing very well and this is one of the rules that helps all the schools be successful. Having cell phones can effect grades and test scores, which we all care about. This is why I believe we shouldn't have school, others may disagree but this will help them have a better lifestyle. This is why I choose policy 2.
