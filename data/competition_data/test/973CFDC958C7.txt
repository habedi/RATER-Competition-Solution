I think limiting car usage is a great idea for america. Studies show that in Bogota, "the people are generating a revolutionary change." Says Enrique Riera, the major of Asuncion, Paraguay. People are either walking to their destinations or riding their bicycles. Also the less you use your car, means less air pollution everywhere so the Earth is more healthier.

Limiting car usage could also help people's physical and mental health. Walking could lower your stress levels and let you think about the nature that you see instead of thinking about what your mad at. I know this from experience because I get stressed very easilyand walking anywhere helps me calm down. Another thing about limiting car usage is that the car wreck percentage would be lower than it is right now. There would also be less deaths in the world if they limited the usage of cars.

Did you know that there are aproximently 118 miles of bicycle paths only in Bogota? Well there is and acording to Mockus, the city's major, "It's the most of any Latin American city." Also you could use the bicycle paths as walking paths for exercise or just to walk anywhere. People would be in more shape if they limited cars. But the only bad thing about using a car in Vauban, Germany is that you have to pay for the car and a spot to keep it whie only being able to drive it on the main throroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

In conclution I think it would be a great idea for America to go car-free.
