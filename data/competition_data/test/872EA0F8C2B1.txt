On the side of optamism, Driveless cars are a wonderful idea with plenty of potential for humans to once again reach further into the future with our tecnalogy. Imagine only saying or putting in your destination and getting there hands free, its like having a personal driver,but anything that sounds that good has to come along with some downsides.

While the industry of driveless cars is expanding slowly but greatly it is yet to be a fully drawn out plan. The driverless cars of today are only somewhat diverless. Meaning they can stop themselvs or drive short distances but still in certain situations the drivers hand is still greatly needed to avoid harm to not only padestrians but to the "hands free" driver as well. Honestly if your hands are needed for certain situations why not just drive fully? If the driver is behind the wheele of a hands free car they will be tempted to do other things with there hands not paying attention to the road at all and we have enough of that with people in self driven cars. That also means that in a situation needing a humans touch would be nothing more than a sudden alarm or vibration going off and needing your reflexes to save either a padestrian or your own life like a quick time event in a videogame. The huge difference is if something goes wrong there are no second chances.

Another issue that could be of concern is as much as technalogy is well loved and how most devote their lives to it, it isn't perfect there are mis haps and incidents that tech causes everyday but though the driveless car idea seems like a good one the tech behind it could not be reliable causing possibly a number of problems. If accidents and shut downs things of that nature are to happen who is at fault the owner who signed the contract to own such car. Or the manufacturer who's faulty equipment could've caused the issue in the first place?

In conclusion the idea of a totally driveless car is ideal. It might even be a necesity for some but until the project is fully finnished and has proven itself to be a great, safe, and dependable form of transportation we should be warry of how fast we say here take my money. One day the Driveless car could become a huge industry all on its own shaping itself into the next big thing but for now, lets stick to driving ourselvs around in the mean time.
