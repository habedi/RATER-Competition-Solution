The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it involves anything to communicate. Professor Thomas Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

The quote says, "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit." Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)."

Most of the experts can identify how people feel about anything like bored, happy, and etc. "Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vinci Code!" Most of the experts knows that faces don't lie. Only the muscles are easy to spot if some people are really "smiling" or something else.
