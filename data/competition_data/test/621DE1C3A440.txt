Dear Principal,

I regret to hear that you will possibly change the student sports policy that they will not be able to play in school activities unless they have a B average in their classes. School sports and activities are privileges that are meant for certain reasons and the students and fell very discouraged that you are planning on taking school activities away for certain individuals that have lower than a B average. This is the reason why I am writing to you and explain that student should not have school activities taken away from them.

Students need to have a after school activity to take stress from school off their mind and you are trying to take that away. If you do take that away from the students then I believe that the students with C or lower averages will do worse in school. This policy should stay the same in our school to ensure that the students don't have any extra stress from school. The students that do play sports are more likely to be more relaxed and less stressed out.

After school activities like sports are a great way to have fun that the kids need when they have been in school all day for 5 days a week. It is very true that sports with the kids that you are around for most of the week will be fun and that motivates the kids to not only be better in school but also better in moral conduct that will impact the way they look at school and their duties at school. Sports and other school activities are a great way to make sure that the majority who do sports will be better students.

Most students who do participate in school activities will do better in school than if they did not do their school activities. The impact sports will have on students will be mostly affect them in a positive way that also mean home work, school work, and their class conduct on and off school grounds. It is statistical that students who participate in school activities are more likely to go to school and study harder for their tests.

I wish that you fell the same way i do about school activities after you read this letter and that you do not change our schools policy that will deeply affect the students, teachers and parents and guardians of these student who will not be able to participate in school activities any more. These students will fell less stress and be more relaxed, have fun while do these sports and activities, and will do better in school.
