From man's very first trip out of Earth's atmosphere to the iconic moon landing, people from all across the world have always wondered what lies in the unknown solar system that surrounds them. Despite the danger and the failures that plagued these early scientists, they still strived to explore space and the planets within it. In writing "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author is able to very convincingly explain the benefits of exploring Venus, despite the dangerous challenges this endeavour may present.

The article starts off by describing Venus and providing background for the reader, allowing the writer to make a stronger and more understandable claim later on in the work. Venus, as described in the article, is often the closest planet to Earth, depending on the time, and is repeatingly called "Earth's 'twin'" because of its similarity in size and density to Earth. The author then goes one to describe the multiple missions already taken to Venus, which have all failed in the end.

While the author does state reasons why a mission to Venus could be treacherous, he or she is able to negate these downfalls by listing all the possible benefits of exploring this inhospitable planet. Venus is considered by scientists to be a dangerous planet to explore for many reasons included in the writing.

For one, its temperature far exceeds in heat any which the Earth has reached by hundreds of degrees. The atmoshpere of Venus also contains a corrosive acid which would be a great obstacle to any vehicle attempting to pass through. The author then goes on to give multiple other reasons in support of danger, but is finally able to oppose these concerns by listing all of the reasons why man kind should explore Venus. For one, Venus is the planet that is most near Earth and therefore will take the shortest time to journey towards. Space travel, the author includes, is very time consuming and not to be taken on lightly. In addition, scientists believe Venus may have once been exceedingly similar to today's Earth. By giving this information, the author is able to infer that information gained by a trip to Venus could be very much crucial to ensuring the survival of the planet home to a large amount of life. The writing claims, after all of these reasons, that "the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable," despite the hardships explorers would face.

In further support of this claim, the author explains the multiple ways that scientists are testing in order to make a trip to Venus possible. The article shows that already, mutiple ideas have been proven to work.

The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," is able to very sucessfully make the claim that Venus is worth exploring through negation of the dangers of such a trip by providing multiple benefits of a visit and the ways in which scientists have already found to make the trip possible. Exploration is exceedingly valuable to maintaining and improving life on Earth and, as written by the author, "should not be limited by dangers and doubts."
