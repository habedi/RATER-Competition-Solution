Adventures at the Sea

You should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program because. You get to learn about so many animals. You get to know how much they eat, and what they eat. As stated in paragraph six it says. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Another reason you should try this program is because it is very big opporuntinity. You get to see the world. You get to know what it is like at sea. Maybe you might like it. And decide that you want to do it for a living on your own ship. It says in paragraph nine. "Im grateful for the opportunity," he says. "It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."

My last reason is that you may be able to learn what other countries are like. Would'nt you like to go explore the world? See what it is like in other places. My stated can be supported by paragraph five. It states in the paragraph. "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special," he says. "So was taking the gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water." Those are the reasons why you should goin the Seagoing Cowboys program today !
