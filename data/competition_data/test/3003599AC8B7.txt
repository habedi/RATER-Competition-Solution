The "Face of Mars" was a huge discovery for the scientists at NASA. Not because of the discovery of Cydonia's face, but rather the attention and funding NASA recieved due to peoples' anticipation of aliens on Mars. The face has been confirmed, by NASA, to not be an alien structure; however, conspiracy theorists and people in denial think what NASA says is a lie.

It is a fact that the Face of Cydonia is only a unique natural landmass (Paragraph 1) The search for the truth of Cydonia started in 1976 when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and was snapping pictures for where its sister ship, Viking 2, could land. the Face of Cydonia was spotted when the Viking 1 circled the region of Cydonia. The face resembled a shadowy likeness of a human face. (Paragraph 2) After the image was surveyed by the mission controllers in the Jet Propulsion Lab, there was an assumed uproar of excitement; however, after all the excitement, Scientists figured it out. It was another Martian Mesa that had a unique resemblense of an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh.

With all this information, people should've been convinced but some still weren't. Scientists over at NASA have come out with the original 1976 image of Cydonia's face. Later on more information had come out and on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original and it gave even more evidence of the face being a butte. People who weren't convinced, or conspiracy theorists, still believe the Face of Cydonia is pure evedience of Aliens even after the second picture.

The Face of Cydonia, factually, is a landmass. For all you people who still don't believe that, you have all the evidence to counter your claims. For example, in paragraph (5), it states that some people like you believe the face of Mars is "Bona fide" evidence of life. you believe that the U.S Government, with NASA, would rather hide any evidence to support the claim of aliens. to counter your claims, NASA used your tax dollars by funding a third expedition to Cydonia. In paragraph (10), it states that on April 8, 2001, NASA took the Mars Global Surveyor close enough for a second look. They found Cydonia's Face and snapped a picture ten times better, in resoulution, than the last one and they gathered even more evidence supporting their claim. Lastly, you conspiracy theorists say NASA is hiding eveidence, yet they gave everyone the images from 1976, 1998, and 2001, with the dates they were taken; even with, the resoulution, camera name, and the pixel size.

In conclusion, all of you conspiracy theorists' counter-arguements have no evidence to back them up; however, NASA has all the evidence of the Face of Cydonia, being a Martian landmass. NASA also has given everyone the eveidence they even gathered. The Face of Cydonia was an exciting discovery, but people who were too excited, were angry with the truth; as a result, conspiracy theorists and defenders of the NASA budget came out in an uproar of denial.
