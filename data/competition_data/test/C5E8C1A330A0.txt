Earth twin, Venus is mainly known as being around the same size and dstance between Earth, but the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere prevents us from exploring our sister planet. Scientists have been planning and have been making progress and adventions on exploring Venus like, making an aircraft that would sustain living conditions while being able to explore Venus wthout being harmed. Scientists have concluded that Venus's geography was once like earths and could contain a livable lifestyle like no other.

Venus is the most hottest planets, while being second in line from the Sun. The atmosphere is 90x greater than Earths, along with the 97% carbon dioxide and reaching over 800 degrees fehrenheit. Venus's Earth like feature consisting of moutains, valleys, and craters can furthermore be our new nearst option for planetary visits. But would the crucial value of going to venus be approcable.

Living on Venus would be around Earths living conditions, with the same amount of pressure and around the same amount of radiation. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans. While scientists are still working on machines to last the challenge of Venus, the innovations would allow them to last more than three weeks in such conditions.

Another project scientists are looking in is old technology like mechanical computers like todays. The devices were envisioned in the late 1800s and was a important role in World War II. The devices would make calculations without electrionic need. In comparison the device would need to rendure extreme physical conditions like, being able to stand up to acid, heat and other forces.

In conclusion the exploration throughout our planets should not be stopped or limited from the danger and risk of finding out beyond your imagination about our neighbors.
