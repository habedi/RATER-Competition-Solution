Homework and studying is hard enough for some students. Being so exhausted and completely worn out after coming back from school is one of the most irritating feelings. One school principal announced to classroom that every every student must have one extracurricular activity. Some students were furious, knowing how hard school already is. Thinking of how they're going to manage their daily routine with another class to take.

For students that are in higher advanced classes or for students that have trouble learning, this change can really affect how they work. While your trying to complete a missing or trying to study for the next test, students have to forget about that and go to their extracurricular activity. Giving to much work for students can affect their emotions, which can turned into stress or anxiety. For students who have trouble learning, they could be struggling in all their classes and can't try to study or practice on their subject since they have to go to their extra class. This much work can lead to the student not paying attention, to procrastinate, and to give up more easily.

While students are working on their homework, studying, and doing their extracurricular class, they will lose time to spend with their family. To much work can take up precious time in your day, whether it is hanging it with your friends or family, going outdoors, or just relaxing. At times students with have to work all night and not sleep at all. When students lose sleep they concentrate less and don't focus in their classes. When you lose time sometimes you don't get all your work complete which could and will affect your grade. Time is essential and now some students are losing it.

The ability to choose if you want to join something, like a club, is good since it's you that wants to do it or not. An extracurricular activity is not a choice, it seems unfair that the students don't get to choose if they want to do it or not. At times the students aren't even interested in any of the activity's. Some students don't like playing sports, drawing for the year book, or serve for the student council. Students should have the choice if they want to do an activity or not.

While students are working hard and trying to get through the year, the school can't just force them to do another subject. Students can get stressed and get to much work to do, losing their concentration. They will lose time to spend with their family and friends. They don't get the chance to choose if they want to take an extracurricular activity or not. In the end, an extracurricular activity is just another thing to worry about.
