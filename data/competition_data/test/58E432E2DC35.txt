Dear Principal

Community Service, wow, it is a great thing to do, but most of the time it isn't that easy and kids have homework and some kids might other important things to do. Which in this case I'm not saying community service is important, but kids have things to do so I believe community service should be a chose not a demanding decision made by others for you, because I feel if you don't chose your own community service then it's just like punishment. I would feel like a punishment because your doing something you don't want to do and it can or cannot be hard for you depending on your skills. Community service does help others, but if you automatically have to do it, such as being forced by someone to do community service it says a lot about their character. Even though, I feel community service is a lot of work on top of everything else a child has to do, i also believe that it is a good way to do good things no matter how much time you do it for.

I agree with my friends that community service takes too much time away from what

I need to do, but sometimes it's not even things that I need to do. Most of the time it's because we do homework and other things we need to do so much that when we have free time we just want to relax and have some fun because of the hard work and effort we put in to our lives and our work. Also as you may know, community service, sometimes is done to be placed as a punishment, so you giving us community service is like a punishment because we would have to do it or else a consequence. So for you to assign community service is ridiculous because we hard and do what we need to and no you want to add more hard work on top of that. Another reason, I feel that you assigning community service is despicable because in life we have to make our own choices. So, for you to make us help people is perplex to me. So if school is supposed to help us manage our life our self, then why would they make our decisions for us on what we do or things they feel we should do.

Lastly, I feel that community service will help the people it is required to help, but who will actually help us with the things we do in life and all the work we need to do. I understand we are helping people and that's a great thing, but we are going to be the unfortunate ones not getting help when we need it because of all the things we need to do.

Many people could help out other people, but the fact that really counts is the time and effort you put into doing it. So if you assign children their own "Community Service" then they won't put the right amount of time and effort, that the person they are helping is needed. So I believe if you want to give children community service let them have a choice or a voice in what they would have time for.

Sincerley,
