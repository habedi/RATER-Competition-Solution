Making students participate in a extracirricular activity would be a good idea. Extracirricluar activities can help students gain more experience of physical strength, social activity and interaction, and new learning experiences. For example; A student who plays football outside of school can strengthen their physical and social health by playing with other team mates and working out at the same time, while maintaing new knowledge about the sport which would include new learning experiences too.

Participating in other activites outside of school can help a student figure out their true interests and help them discover carrers for the future. Making students try and learn something new can be beneficial if they are having trouble finding what peaks their interest. However, there may be some downfalls to this new idea. Extracirricular activites may sometimes not be so easy to manage. Especially with sports or activites for the school. Some activites can make students weeks feel stressful and overwhelming at times. Sometimes actvities can mess with the students outside life such as; traveling, family, religious purposes, etc.

Activites that are easily able to maintain with the persons schedule and peaks the students interest should be acceptable to participate in. New opportunities could come up for the student reguarding to college or even future jobs. If a student decides to choose this activity in the future, companies would see that they have extra experience and might increase their chance of giving or accepting job offers to that particular student. If he/she works hard in school and maintains a healthy schedule that would not affect them severly, the student might get a scholarship from many different colleges and major in that specific category.

He/she might even make new friends in their new activity and might increase their chance of wanting to continue doing the program with them. Making new friends is also beneficial and could help increase the persons chance of wanting to continue participating in this new sport or activity.

Overall, making students participate in extracirricular activites outside of school or for the school would be great to improve the students physical, social, and emotional health, help the sudent gain more knowledge about the acitvity, and decide future carrers and interests.
