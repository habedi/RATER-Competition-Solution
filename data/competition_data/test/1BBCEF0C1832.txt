Dear Principle,

I think that cutting the schools policy on which only kids with a b average can play sports. To me that is unfair because some people are really good at sports but no that great academic wise. So ask yourself, would you like to win or lose because if someone is really good at a sport but they don't have the grades then all the kids that cant play wont play and the ones that can play since the kids that are good have c' s and then we will have to play someone which means we have to play the ones that aren't good will have to play and then we will lose. So please reconsider this. And plus the old rules stated that kids with a 2.0 or higher got to play sports. Well think of all the students who want to play but cant because you made this new policy you made up. Now all the kids who have 2.0s cant play and they will be mad at you for this and they will pretty much give up and they wont like you and then our test scores and other important education goals will be lost. So I ask you please to reconsider this because i want everyone to have a opportunity to play a sport.

Sincerely,
