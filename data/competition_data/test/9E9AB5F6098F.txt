Hello and my name is Luke and I am a Seagoing Cowboy.

I have seen many things since I became one.

So, I want you to try and give it a chance.

My friend, Don, invited me to go to sea when I was working in a grocery store and bank.

I couldn't say no so I went with him.

When I got there, they hired Seagoing Cowboys to go out on the ocean.

When I became one, I had to go to Greece.

But before I got there, I turned eighteen years old.

Then, after the trip to Greece, I made nine trips, more than any other Seagoing Cowboy.

You get see amazing sights when you are on a trip.

Taking care of horses and cattle on the sea can be very fun.

It is a very fun thing to do on the sea.

But if you hve little paitience, I don't think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One normal trip is can be about two weeks.

And a trip to China can be about a month.

But if you can handle paitience, I would be okay with you trying the program.

So if you like going to foreign countries, raising cattle, and going on sea, you should try the program.
