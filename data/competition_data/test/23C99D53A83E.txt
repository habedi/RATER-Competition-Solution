One day while i was at my job working for NASA, I heard a door open. I turned to look, and in walked a conspiracy theorist, knuckles dragging the ground, dead eyes staring, and drool escaping from his open mouth. "May I help you, sir?"

"Yeah! I know there's a face on Mars and i want you scientists to stop hiding the evidence!"

Here we go again I thought. I had seen thousands of people like him, asking the exact same thing. and every time my reply was the same: There is no face on Mars. The appearance of the face is caused by shadows on a mesa.

However they never believe me. "Those pictures are faked so that you can hide the evidence!"

I always give them the standard reply that the pictures are official and that is that.

One thing I as a scientist don't understand about these people is why they think an alien civilization would build a giant replica of a HUMAN face. Theres no way they'd even know we existed, so why bother?

In conclusion conspiracy theorists are going to believe there is a face on Mars no matter how much evidence we give them to the contrary, so why even bother trying.
