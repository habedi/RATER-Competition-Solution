Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME

and i strongly agree with the idea of Policy 1. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a very smart compromise with students and teachers.

The reason why i think it's the best policy is because students may need their phones if parents are trying to contact them in case of an emergency, or students trying to contact them.

If there were a tornado occurring and all of the school power were to be out students with phones could call their parents to come and pick them up.

My second reason is if students were on medication and they forgot to take it and started to feel sick, they could always call their parents to bring in their medication before it got very serious to the point where they could pass out. In addition the this reason if students were feeling sick but the nurses in the school didn't allowed them to take medication they could call their parents to come pick them up and take the medication at home.

My third and final reason is if a crook were to enter the building and threaten to injure anyone a student could always call 911 in the classroom saying their school is being threaten. They would probably prevent a lot of students or teachers from being injured. Or if they don't feel safe in school they could call their parents to come and pick them up.

My conclusion is that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and only use them during free hours as long as the phones are turned of during class hours. They are allowed to bring them in case of emergency, sickness, or if their school were to be threaten.
