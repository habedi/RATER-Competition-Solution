If my principal decided everyone had to participate in one extracurricular activity, and you asked me if I agreed or disagreed; then I would say I agree. I have done soccer, gymnastics, and ballet in the past. The activities I do now are swimming and violin. I have done several activities in my life, so my essay will be biased. I agree with my principals decision, because participating in an extracurricular activity can benefit your grades, health, and you may discover new friends.

You can participate in something like an after school club to improve or maintain your grades. If you need help on schoolwork then you could go to something like a homework club; that would count as an extracurricular activity and you could be productive at the same time. Another bonus of doing an activity is that it could teach better time management. Since you would most likely choose a hobby to participate in if you were forced to do an extracurricular activity; you would want to get your work done and keep your grades up so that you can enjoy the activity. If you try out or join a team for sports that's great too. Sports can teach you to be a team player and responsibility; both of which can help keep your grades up. Group projects are sometimes hard to work on because someone does not want to participate, but if everyone learns to work together then you can get the project done. Eighth graders are always forgetting things, and learning responsibility can help them keep track of homework and schoolwork better.

Health is important, otherwise we wouldn't have a class on it. Engaging in any activity outside of school can make you happier in school, because you will be looking forward to whatever activity you are doing. Another reason you should participate in an extracurricular activity is, when your brain needs breaks from thinking about school, and what better way than to join a club or sport! Either one can get your brain looking at certain things from a new angle. Participating in any extracurricular activity can also help you get engaged in the community and world around you.

Everyone wants a friend right? What better way than to find someone who has the same hobby or interest as you. It can be hard to make friends sometimes, but that shouldn't stop you from trying. You may be able to narrow the search for a friend by finding something you enjoy doing and find someone who has the same interest as you. It's also nice to have a friend who you can have a long conversation about what you both enjoy. If you join a club or sport, and then find one of your other friends that you didn't know would be there, thats fun and exciting. You discovered that you and your friend like the same thing and just didn't know it, but you never know until you put yourself out there a little.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why I agree with the principals decision to make everyone do one extracurricular activity. These are the points I would use to pursuade people to support the principal. I agree, because participating in an extracurricular activity can benefit your grades, health, and you may discover new friends.
