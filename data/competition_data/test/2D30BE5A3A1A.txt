Are you excited for the summer? Finally having warm weather again, going to the beach and spending the free days with friends and family? Students cannot wait for summer break. Nevertheless, school should not be completely forgotten; therefore, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. That helps students to catch up with their classes and to be ready to go back in the fall. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually, teachers have been students when they were younger and have experience and many students are too lazy and unorganized to pick a project by themselves.

Not everyone would agree with that position. Some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because students can tell what they need to study to be ready for the next school year. No one knows better than themselves what they are good at and where they need to improve. For example, Generic_Name is going to do a summer project in 2020. She organizes all by herself because she knows what she needs to catch up with. Generic_Name can combine her interests with learning and is going to be ready for the next school year with a student-designed project.

Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually. For example, my aunt is a high school teacher and her students have to do a project during summer break. She teaches biology and knows her students very well. She gives them a topic for the summer project, which includes specific learn methods for every student. This shows that teachers can help their students individually and know what they need to catch up with to start positive in the new grade and not already be lost in the beginning of the year.

In addition, teachers have been students themselves when they were younger. They have experience about summer projects and can help students to organize them. For example, when Generic_Name, a teacher at Generic_School, gives summer projects, he can help his students a lot because he had to go through the same things when he was a student, but now he knows the best way how to handle those summer projects and can bring his experience to the students.

Finally, many students are too lazy and unorganized to pick the project and give directions to themselves. They might choose an easy project that they already know about, so they would not learn about something new and waste their time. For example, in the book "Conni & Co", the main character Conni has to do her summer project by herself without any help. She tries her best. She makes a plan and is motivated before the break starts. It turns out that her plan is very unorganized and she spends almost everyday of her break with her friends but does not focus on her project. She also picks a topic about horses, which she is very familiar with and thinks she does not need so much time because of that. Conni starts the night before the first day of school ,but, obviously, it is too late and she ends up with not finishing her project. That movie is the perfect example that summer projects should be teacher-designed because with the help of teachers students can get more organized, learn more and can get their work done.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually, teachers have been students when they were younger and have experience and many students would be too lazy and unorganized to pick a project by themselves. Teachers know how to organize those projects and make them learn effective for the students. So if your school requires you to complete summer projects, ask your teachers. They would love to help you continue learning during the break and want only the best for your future.
