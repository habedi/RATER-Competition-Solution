Dear Principal,

I think the new policy sounds like a great idea. It would push the kids harder to improve their grades. If they really want to play the sport they will do everything and anything to improve their grades. For example, I know if I didn't have a B-average, I would do anything to improve it. I take sports very seriously and I know most of our school does. I think the policy would definitely improve our grades. Students in yearbook and groups like that should also have to keep a B-average.

What ever extra activity people are in, they will want to be apart of it, and not have to sit out because they have bad grades.

I also think the policy would make our school look better. If most of the students, if not all of them had a B-average our school would be able to participate in many things we don't now.

For example, if most of the school participates in an extra activity, that would mean most of the school is keeping a B-average. That would mean our school could be apart of spelling bees, or something that deals with competing with other schools.

The new policy would also help the students get on the right track when it comes to college. If the students worry about their grades now, and throughout high school, they will be able to go to college. This will help students will failing grades realize that they need good grades to have a happy life and go into a certain profession.

This will also teach students a lesson in life. It will teach them that they need to work for what they want. Nothing in life comes easy.

If they want to have a successful life, they will need to work for it. They can't just lay back and expect to achieve everything in life. If they want to become a famous athlete, they need to train. If students want to go to college, they are going to work hard and keep their grades up.

Again i think the policy would improve the students that go to this school.

Sincerely,
