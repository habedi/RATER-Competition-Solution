Have you ever wanted to have input on an assignment or lab in a class? Have you ever wished that a course you had taken, wasn't so boring? Through "Facial Action Coding Systems", computers can notice when students are bored, or angry during class. But, is this technology beneficial in a classroom?

According to the article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile", this technology has a wide-range of uses. It could be used to modify different assignments in class. Some could argue, that students don't want to be monitored by a computer in class. Most students, would rather have a traditional teacher, than a computer. With a teacher in the classroom, students learn responsibility and communication.

Not only, do teachers do a better job at teaching, but it is also a large amount of jobs across the world. With giving this job to computers, many people would be out of work. Students could no longer strive, to teach the next generation. Without teaching jobs, the economy would go down.

As the article states, "Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to Decode Mona Lisa's smile." The cost of this technology must be very expensive. Though, schools would no longer have to pay teachers, they would have to pay for the computers, software, and applications for the use of this technology. Set aside, the amount of maintenance and updates needed to keep them running.

Unlike teachers, computers need electricity and charged. Computers don't always function, and if they aren't working, you can't simply call in a substitute to do it's work for it. With teachers, they work everyday, and if they are sick or cannot come into school, they can easily call in a qualified substitute, to do their job for them.

In the end, teachers get their jobs done, are extremely cheap to hire, and teach students many beneficial skills. Though, a computer could work very well, they are very expensive, and do not always work. Teachers are the best option. The "Facial Action Coding System" is not the way to go.
