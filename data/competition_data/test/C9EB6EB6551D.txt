Online classes are a great idea. The benefits of online classes are the student won't have any distraction around him. Online classes are small and everyone gets there own teachers. The disadvantage is not completing the course. These are the reason why I think online classes are much beneficial then regular class.

The student will be more focused on their school work. As there is no distraction around him. For example, a smart student sometimes isn't able to finish his work because they would be talking to other students during class. There is no other student just you and the teachers so you won't have any distraction. There is no distraction in their room if their alone.

Online classes are known to be small. There for its good as the student would have a one on one conversation with the teacher. If the student does't understand something, and needs help the teacher being able to give more time and attention to the student. When you finish with the class your done you won't have to wait for anybody else. Basally online classes are school but independent just you and the teacher.

The disadvantage are not completing the course ,because most students get distraction watching or reading other things online not related to school. Also not completing assignment or the course thinking its not school because your not going to school. You also won't be able to interact with other student. Also you can't participate in clubs or sports team after school because your talking classes online. You can pay at a private school or a team to do a after school activity.

I personal agree that online classes are more beneficial to the student. The student would focused on the school work because there is no distractions around them. The teachers would give them more time and attention to the student because it's one teacher per student. If you want to do a after school activity you can pay and play a sport for the team pay a private school to do a club. These advantages to do Online classes.
