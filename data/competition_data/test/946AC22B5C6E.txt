Going to school is a big part of everyones life, thats where most find their passion and decide what they want to do in the future, that where people find their life long friends. Most people have grown up going to school everyday, wouldnt it be weird if that just suddenly changed? Some schools are starting to offer distance school, this is where the students can learn from home online. While most think this is a good idea, the students would not benefit from learning at home. The students might have a hard time learning and can easily get distracted, not to mention all the experience they would miss out on. It would be hard to change this setting, all the work that was put into a school to make it better would all go to waste.

Students learn better when a teacher is there to help them learn. Some students need to have that one on one contact. They learn visually, the teacher needs to show them how to solve a problem. In math, its all writing and solving new equations, it can be hard to learn math without a teacher there to show you the right way. Some people will disagree and will say that online videos are the same thing, but they are not. When watching online videos, no one is there to check your work, making sure that everything is right. If a student doesnt understand the topic, they would have to search it up and they could find the wrong answer or it could be very confusing. One of my friends did online school for a year, and she told me that it was harder for her to learn at home and took her a while to learn certain topics without a teacher there to help her. Say a student wants to become a chemist, to learn in school, you do labs to help understand chemistry. At home, you can't do certain labs because you need special equipment and chemicals to complete the lab that you dont have at home. It is harder for me to learn online, I always need a teacher to help and show me what to do when I first learn a topic, its easier for me to understand. Students need a teacher to help them learn and understand a topic in school.

At school, students can get distracted, but in their mind, they know school is a place to learn. The environment that they are set in from the beginning helps them get put in the right mind set to learn. Changing that environment can effect how the student learns. At home, you can get distracted very easily because you have no one there to tell you to do your work or put your phone away. The student can do whatever they want at home, no one is there to stop them. Not only can they easily get distracted, they can cheat on tests and quizes. Searching up an answer is so easy because they have their phones and computers to help them. They aren't using their own knowledge to help them learn, which could effect them in the future when they actually need that knowledge for a job. Texting friends for the answers is one click away too. The student will never gain the knowledge by themselves and be able to retain it.

Sometimes kids have a hard time learning social skills or interacting with others, if they are at home they can never gain those skills. Being in a school environment can help kids interact with others everyday to make friends, they are forced to interact with other students. Making friends and keeping friends can be hard too with online school. Referring back to my friend who did online school, we started to drift because I stopped seeing her everyday and we didnt have time to hang out. She told me that she missed seeing her friends everyday and got very bored throughout the day at home. She also missed out on a lot of high school experience, missing pep rallies, homecoming, sports games, and even just sitting at lunch with her friends everyday. Those little things can make a big difference. Adults always say that high school was the best time of their lives, having so much fun, but if you physically dont go to school, you can miss out on a lot, or even experiencing the best time of your life.

Taking away the physical aspect of going to school can change a lot of things. Students can have a harder time learning and they can miss out on those special parts of life. What would be the point of the building then if everyone decided to do online school. The teachers would not be needed anymore. This is why offering online school can be challenging. Going to school helps the students a lot and would not be a good idea to take that away from them.
