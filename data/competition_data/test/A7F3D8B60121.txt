Would you ever consider exploring Venus? In my opionion I would explore Venus because it would be a great experience and also it would be a challenge to do something that outrageous. Venus is a worthy pursuit because you can discover so much and the story states that the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craterse. In the story "The Challenge of Exploring Venus it talks about what the planet Venus and it gives information about Venus,and also if the author would explore it. In the story Venus is the second planet from the sun while Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth,it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Earth,Venus,and Mars,our other planetary neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in spped mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Becasue Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent mumerous spacecraft to lan d on this cloud-draped world.

The story also gives a lot of information about Venus and how challenging exploring Venus really is. Such as,A thick atmosphere of alomost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet.

However,striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travel on Earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

In conclusion discovering Venus and it being outrageous the planet is dangerous but like the story says "Earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should expanded to meet the very edges of imagination,Despite of this planet being dagerous exploring a planet is also a one in a life time thing and doing something like this is advangerous and it something you can remember for ever.
