I am against the value of using the Facial Action Coding System because some people may try to hide a feeling like be upset or sad because they don't know how to tell someone why and how they feel. Just because they are hiding what they feel doesn't mean that someone can take new technology and found out what their feeling, because if they wanted people to know how they felt they would.

On the other hand if you use the technlogy you could change a lesson if a student was becoming bored or confused to help them do better in school. This technology could help more students pass classes so they can graduate. But some may not like the thought of someone being able to look at a computer and finding out what they are feeling.

They need to respect what people feel and not try to figure what is wrong because they didn't want to tell. If they found out they person may get upset and by confused at what happened. Using this could cause people to be disapointed in what people are feeling. This could cause people to get angry at others. Just because the technology exists doesn't mean that you have to use it.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding Stsyem shouldn't be use. This is because people may not want others to know want they feel, if they did they would tell them. But if they just told they wouldn't need the Facial Action Coding System. Some students may be struggling with things and may talk but what they are feeling but if they are confused they could just ask for help. Just because students dont show their feelings doesn't mean that they won't when they are ready. You should let people express their feelings at their own time not by using technology that could tell what someone is feeling. Using this technology would cause to be frustrated even more because they can't tell people what they feel on their own because the technology would tell people ins't and not when the person is ready to tell people what they feel.
