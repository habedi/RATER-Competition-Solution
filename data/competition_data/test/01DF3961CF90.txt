Dear, principal i completely disagree with your actions of changing the policy that kids must have a B average to compete in sports i think u should change the policy back to c average and i have 3 reasons to show you why u should.

First, Not all kids can make the B average standard cause they may be going through problems with their family, maybe they have a short attention span and can't help t that they get off task or maybe they are just unorganized and lose their homework all the time.

Second, To some kids sports is their life and that's all they got and they much rather be playing sports then on the street corner selling drugs, gang banging, getting into trouble, or maybe they jus don't wannabe sitting at home being lazy. Sometimes kids just need to get away from home or just want to try new things so they play sports

Third, To some kids sports are their future and they cant make the grade average so that keeps them from playing sports and achieving their future dream as an famous athlete. An making it into college so that they can leave their home town and explore the world or just stay their and experience new things.

Conclusion, those are my opinions why i think you should change the grade average back to a C.
