Projects are another way to have fun while learning something new. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projects should be student-designed, for they will help students gain creative skills and stay educated while being outside of school.

Firstly, students will gain creative skills. Working on a project will allow them to explore and use abilities they normally dont use. For example, a student can design a project and use different skills he or she didn't know they had. My sister had a big science project she had to create on her own. She came up with her own ideas and plans, such as, drawing pictures, creating an experiment, calculating the results, and putting together a chart about the experiment. Students can enjoy summer break while designing a project with many skills.

Secondly, students will stay educated while being out of school. One can learn new things on their own without being in a classroom. For example, he or she won't forget everything they've learned after school ends for summer break. Every summer I forget what I've learned and what I've been taught due to how much time I've spent out of school. It would be a pleasure to design a project and use many of my abilities I've gained while I was in school. Designing a projects has many benefits including gaining and using many skills.

However, some projects are as simple as folding a a paper air plane; one won't need a lot of skills. In addition to, some students want a break from education and have fun on summer break. Consequently, not everyone knows how to fold a paper airplane, but after one has learned how to fold a paper airplane, he or she has gained a new skill. Furthermore, students can still have fun while designing their own projects because it will be student-designed instead of teacher-designed.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed, for they will help students gain creative skills and stay educated while being outside of school. The way this issue could be impacted by my view is by, creating a project so that my creative abilities are not wasted and in a way, I can still learn something new. One can learn and still have during summer break just by designing a project.
