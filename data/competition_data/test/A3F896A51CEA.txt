Should students design they're summer projects or should teachers do. I think the teachers should do it, why. My first opinion is that the teachers will know what he/she is struggling with, and the teachers would know what assignments will help that student. My second opinion is that, Teachers will know what to do to help out a struggling student, because they been doing it for years. My third opinion is if the students designs they're own summer project they might pick a project that might not help them. The summer projects should be design from a teacher not a student because the students won't know what their doing.

The first reason why is because, Teachers has been working with they're students all year long. So that means the teachers will know what each of his/her students are struggling with, So when teachers are about to pick out a summer project he/she will know whats the best project for his/her students. This way the students won't have the same problems next year.

The second reason why is because, Teacher will already know what to do. Teachers has been assigning projects for years, They will know what project will benefit his/hers students. If a student designs the project it might not benefit most students or it might not make any sense for other students. Also a student doesn't have the same experience from a teacher that has been working with students for years.

The last reason why is because, a student will not know whats the best project for them self or won't take it serous. A student might not want to do a summer project so he/she might design a project that will be easy and less time to finish. Also they might design a project that won't help them with there problems. It's also the teachers job to do it not the students.

So my opinion is that, teachers should design the summer project and not the student. Because teachers has more experience than a student, will know whats the best project to help out a struggling student, and a student might pick a project that might not help them out.
