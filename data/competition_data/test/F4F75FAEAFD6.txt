When I first read this prompt my first thought was, why would any student ever want work over break? Students go to school Monday through Friday for 8 hours a day, summer for teenagers is suppose to be kids having fun, getting a job to maybe achieving some goals, maybe making some money. It's also suppose to be a time for no stressing, and just focusing on being happy, and most school projects cause a good amount of stress for most students. But if I had to pick between students designing it or the teacher designing it, I would pick the students designing my project.

If students designed the project they would be more likely to design a project they might actually want to do, and spend their time on, so maybe when they finish their project they can have time for other things. Students would also be able to pick a project they would have fun doing over the summer, not every school project has to be miserable. Students would also be able to pick how much work they'd want to do and what kind of project they would be willing to do. If they have too much work, or a project they don't like doing most students would probably procrastinate on finishing it and put their work off till last minute, then the project would be rushed and sloppy.

If teachers designed their project then they would probably have more work than they wanted, and also a harder project to do, and something the students would probably have no fun doing at all. One positive thing, if teachers did design the project, would be the fact it would be really well constructed and put together. If the students designed the entire project it would probably be a little confusing for them and not put together as well, as if the teachers did it. That wouldn't be good on any ones part, the teachers would hate grading the project and the students would achieve a bad grade.

It seems that they're many pros and cons for both sides, the students and the teachers, determining on who shall design the project and what the pros and cons are, are just personal opinions. Your opinion is determined on your personal experience, and the teachers and students you've been around. How the teacher is and how the students are determine who should design the project, everyone is different.

In conclusion, I think students designing the project would be better, especially if they put in hard work and effort, I think most students would rather have fun with the project and decide what they want to do on their own rather than having a teacher design it and pick everything students have to do. Most students would probably be miserable doing it then, or procrastinate and not do anything at all. But nobody can do anything if they don't put their mind to it.
