Many students dread their summer projects and procrastinate what is intended to be a three month long project or book till mere hours before the bell rings on their first day back. However, the stereotypical teenager angst that resents the idea of summer homework can be sternly challenged due to the great benefit for students working their brains during their time off. Some say that summer projects would be more enjoyable and valuable to students if they were designed by their peers instead of teachers. I disagree and believe that the teacher of a particular course can give the best synopsis to their class and set straight the expectations and course load through the summer assignment. Summer projects are a great tool to keep students' brains stimulated over the break, and they should be teacher designed in order to provide students with a strong background on a topic that will be further discussed during the school year, help to prepare students for the style of a teacher that they may be unfamiliar with, and allows the student to view a glimpse of the rigor and expectations that accompany a particular course.

Summer projects are beneficial when they provide the opportunity for the student to learn more about a topic that will be discussed in their class during the year. It is essential that the students are given the opportunity to establish a strong framework that they can later build on with the help of their peers and teachers. Because this background is so vitally important I believe that it is the most beneficial for the summer project that will guide the student on their quest for more knowledge is designed by the teacher who knows exactly what topics will be covered in their class and what would be in the utmost importance to get an early understanding on. During the summer before Freshmen year my English class required a summer assignment on the Odyssey be completed. At first I was bummed out because I did not want to spend my summer doing homework, however it proved to be wildly beneficial and I enjoyed it. The summer assignment was designed by my English teacher and asked us the look more into specific characters and stories that she knew we would have a test on shortly after returning to school. Because the I completed the assignment that my teacher crafted with care, I was beyond prepared for our test on the Odyssey and all in class discussions on the matter.

Teachers even within the same discipline can have drastically different teaching styles, which is another reason why I believe that summer assignments should be curated by the teacher. A summer assignment made by that teacher should provide a glimpse into that particular teacher's style and allows the student to see early on what their new teacher places emphasis on while grading. During a student's schooling career it is unlikely that they will ever encounter a teacher whos style is identical to another teacher that they have had which is why it is of the utmost importance that students are allowed the opportunity to get to know their knew teacher and what the teacher will expect of their class before they even step foot in their classroom. For example my Freshmen and Sophomore year history teachers both were amazing history teachers but my individual learning preferences meshed much better with one of them. The different styles of teaching work better for different students depending on how they best learn, but it is important for the student to get a glimpse of their new teacher through the summer assignment.

Summer assignments should also reflect the rigor of their corresponding course while setting forth the expectations that the teacher will have for their students in the class. Students gaining a general idea on how hard a particular class will be is extremely valuable if done so over the summer because then that allows for time at the beginning of the school year for the student to potentially switch to a different difficulty level if so desired. Because the summer assignment could potentially determine if the student drops the class to move levels it is integral that the assignment be as class to the demand and standard of the actual class as possible. For this reason I believe that the teacher would be able to give the student a better accurate impression of the rigor of their class than a fellow student could give their peer. For example a summer assignment for AP U.S. History would be a great way for the teacher to open their future students horizon on the course and give an idea on how much homework that should be expected, the requirements for analytical pieces of writing like a data based question, and the overall expectations of the class.

Summer assignments are a great way to get students' brains moving over the long break and can be beneficial in many different ways. These benefits like increased background knowledge and exposure to new teaching styles are hinged upon weather or not the assignment is made by students or teachers. Summer assignments should be teacher designed because it shows the student the rigor of the course, enables students to gain a strong background on subjects that will be discussed during the year, and helps to expose students to the style of their new teacher.
