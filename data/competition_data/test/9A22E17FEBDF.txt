First things first, I cannot actually picture this type of technology in schools, let alone actualy working. People including me can easliy be feeling happy or sad or any other emotion without showing signs of it in their face. Not that I do it on purpose but it is hard to crack a smile unless I'm laughing which is rarely. Most of the time I will just have a blank face untouched by emotions so how would a computer be able to read how I'm feeling? Half the time I don't even know how I'm feeling myself. I can see this technology being installed in schools and other places only for it to wrongly tell me or others such as teachers how I'm feeling. I can picture it now, I'm sitting in silence writing an essay over something stupid such as the one I'm doing now and all of a sudden my teacher is alerted that I'm confused or bored maybe even sad a little only to have to argue that I'm in fact all right and fine. Sounds like a pain to me.

Chapter 6, line 6-8 states that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." I see a point here and it would be very interesting to see if this worked on a class but I'm still unfazed. What if the computer did do just that but unknowingly to it the kids were in fact not bored or confused in the slightest? Then the lesson once taught would be changed making it harder for the kids to learn and get the knowlede they need.

Another example is in chapter 6, line 10-12 said by Dr. Huang "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," "So computers need to understand that, too." I'm no doctor but Huang is so he probably does have a point here. Most human communication is nonverbal and that might be true to a lot of people but do computers really need to understand our emotions because of it? I for one do communicate verbally I don't understand how else you could communicate. If i'm feeling a certain way I'll speak it if approprate. Computers don't need to know your emotions for any reason it is a computer not your significent other. If someone is on a computer they are probably working on something or killing time and goofing around none of which call for the device to read how you are feeling.

In conclusion I find the new technology quite useless and not worth the time. As interesting as it is and I would like to see it in person and test it myself, I think computers are computers and don't need to know how I am feeling. Why should it know? It's my emotions not its and I can't see it actually being able to read how I am feeling when I don't even know how I am feeling. Therefore I am against it.
