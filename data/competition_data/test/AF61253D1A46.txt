Many people think that the " Face on Mars " was created by aliens.

Due to the lack of evidence on that theory I have all the reason to believe that it is not.

Like, Earth has all these natural landforms, Mars could also have many natural landforms. NASA would even want there to be Martians.

I can also see how your mind could come to thinking that aliens are real.

To those who say that NASA is just trying to hide evidence.

When in fact, finding an ancient Martian civilization would help them, because they can be granted more money to investigate the life forms.

So, if ther was an alien we would try to capture it the first chance we have.

A big reason that I think that you just believe in aliens is you are just trying to stick with the status quo.

There is no doubt in my mind that some part of you thinks that the " Face on Mars " was made by aliens comes from media, movies, books, radio talk shows, and etc.

Don't tell me you don't go to the grocery checkout and see the magazine article that says, " The Face on Mars was made by real aliens.

Like, Earth has many natural landforms, Mar could very well could have them to.

One big thing that jumps out to me is Mars has never seen a human face before, so how could they have made it.

Another fact is that Earth have landforms just like this particular Martian landform.

Those landforms are butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

So, as you can see that all the evidence here points to the " Face on Mars " being just another landform.

Like, the butte or mesa.

NASA has all the more reason to want Martians.

That, media has an effect on human minds.
