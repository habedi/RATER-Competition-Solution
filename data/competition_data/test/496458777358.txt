I think students should participate in extracurricular because. Teachers can help you with your homework, I stayed after school and my teacher Generic_Name helped me with my homework and helped study for the test we were having the next day i was so proud and pumped for the test because i was ready and prepared and luckily i passed it. I think students should participate in extracurricular because. You can meet new students, I thought i wasn't going to like after school drama class but turns out i loved it because i met new students they were so nice and friendly, i met this boy named Generic_Name he was so nice and funny, we hung out a lot and laughed a lot and we were texting,face timing him everyday and we became best friends. I think students should participate in after school extracurricular activities because sports help you stay in shape. Once i joined the soccer team and we ran a lot and did a lot of tricks people from my school saw a difference in me they told me that i looked Skinner and they thought i wasn't eating so i told them that i joined the soccer team and that soccer helped me lose weight and stay in shape.
