To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME,

I am informed of your new policy change. I understand your views and though I understand academics are important, students need encouragement, recreation, and the opportunity to be well rounded and I find these things are in extra curricular activities and sports.

Due to your consideration of this new policy it would be harsh on the children and director of the certain activity. By making this rule, I feel as if the students would be lacking the circumstances they need besides academics. Extra curricular activities enrich the mind, community, and body. Taking these things away from the children gives them nothing to look forward to after school, and keeps the school stress bundled up inside of them. Sports and clubs encourage students to relieve their stress, make friends, and become active in their community. So if a certain student really struggles, it would be discouraging and crush their self-esteem.

Students that struggle have a right to enjoy activities, and maybe there would be an alternative to keep kids in sports and clubs, yet also maintain their grades. Possibly, you could organize a study group or extra help sessions from teachers after school so that they can participate in their activities but also keep up the grades. Since a C average is an average grade for most student, it would put down their confidence as if you were saying they are below the average, which could hurt the student's feelings very much.

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak my mind and I thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. I hope you thoughtfully consider my thoughts and opinions considering I myself, am a student of this school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
