I believe students should be required to do community service. I think this because kids and adults are littering themselves and they should clean up for what they did or even if they don't they should so the government and the world can save me and we wont be in this "economic conflict". Also people should do community service to help others like participate in tutoring to help others. But i believe they should get done what they need to get done 1st. As long as they help with someone that's good to me. For example i tutor my brother and his friends that need help with homework or class work or something like that. We all know all students are not going to want to participate in doing community service because they think there to good for doing that but we can atleast try to convince people to help. Students will think community service is a punishment. But even if it is they should be happy to help others. I also believe cops should take more responsibility in doing some community service also, because i see cops littering all the time. But kids my age should definitely be required to do community service. Students should help other students in anything like maybe like homework or something. I get tutored in algebra by a friend of mine. He takes time out of his day to help me. But some kids may not be able to do community service because they may have a health problem or they might need help in something themselves. But students should be required to do community service if they do not have any problems or something similar.
