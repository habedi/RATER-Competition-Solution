The face look alike that was on Mars was not created by aliens. Many people may believe that but they might just want to belive that there are such things as aliens. The face was created by just landforms. Reasonings being is, MOC, or Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture, the NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get such an accurate photo, and people over the interent were making their own stories up to make it seem like there was an alien that made that.

MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the face like rock. When they took a picture that was alot more accurate and sharper looking than what Viking's had taken, they were able to zoom in and look at more then just the face. The passage says, " Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all." Which, since they ARE scientist, they have done their research on the picture and done as much looking into as they possibly could have.

NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get an accurate photo. In the article it says, "... Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face." So, when the Viking's took the picture and the shadow was in it, it made it look something more than what the MOC had caught. The Viking's had no profesional camera to take that picture of the landform. Also, they were far away from the planet, they were circling it, so the shadow that they were seeing had to of been from something else. Or maybe from what they were even in.

People over the internet were making their own stories up. In the article it states, "A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth." Since people believe whatever they see on the interent, they had to of jumped to conclusions and people had to of been throwing out the idea of "Oh! that has got to be made by an alien!" so that's what people starting saying. The NASA reveiled th photo hoping it would bring attention to Mars, but that is sure what they got. But it was the atention that an alien had made the landform.

So, with that being said, MOC had actual camera photage of the landform, NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get accurate pictures, and people over the internet were just trying to make it seem like an alien was real. That proves that the face was just a natural landform.
