you're best way to learn? well, I think the kids that are studying from their house have benefits because they can do their class work at anytime they want in the day. Like they can turn in classwork after they get off work. Because you have unlimited amount of time to do it. The student that is doing online class would have more time to sleep and, eat their breakfast and whenever they are ready to start their work, they can start working. They don't have to wake as earlier as the rest of the people going to school. Theres less work you get more time to do what you got to do and if got other class online you can will be able to finish the work because they give a lot of time to complete the units. It's good because if a student don't like going to school they have another way of doing work. another reason that online school is good because if you finish all you're work for the online class you can take a break till they give you more work and, once you finish all the work for the year your done for the year. Those are the many reasons I think online class are benefited to some students in school.

But at the sometime their disadvantages of taking online class because you don't have someone to help when your having trouble on homework. Like you will be very confused about the subject,and you won't know what to do. Or if you lose internet you won't be able to turn in the work cause their's no connection. Or if you forget to do your online classwork. You also have to complete the in a specific amount of time. Like if you don't finish on time it possible ruin your chance of passing the online class. Another reason why online can't be as good as normal school is because the person doing the online class isn't getting one on one contact with other students and teachers. Also if you start having problems with the website to do your online work it would be difficult for the student to finish his work. These are the many disadvantages of taking online class. If i was to pick between these option, I would pick going to normal school because you might have problems with website,internet or you might just forget about it. But i would pick school cause you can talk to the teacher when your having trouble on the work or, you just need extra help on things in class.
