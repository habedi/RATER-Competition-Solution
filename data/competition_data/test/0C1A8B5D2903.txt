Mrs. Principal,

I understand that you are reconsidering our school's cell phone policy, and I would like for you to take my ideas into consideration.

I believe that both policies are honorable ideas, but neither is shear perfection.

For the first policy, you proposed allowing students to bring phones to school as long as they were turned off during class time.

The students would most likely be satisfied with being allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

Yet, there will, in all likelihood, be a select few that will attempt to continue to use their phones during class time nevertheless.

The second policy stated that students should not be allowed to have phones at school at any time.

Although this would dissolve the issue of phones being on during class, most every student would be outraged at the thought of not having a phone on their person.

Plus, parents might be disgruntled about having no way to contact their child once out of school.

I propose that you combine both policies to create a more plausible one.

Say that students would be allowed to bring their cell phones to school, but it must be turned off and put away at all times.

The only exception would be before school started and after the final class of the day is dismissed.

I sincerely hope that you take my proposals into account when making your final decision about the cell phone policy.

However, I am aware of the fact that you are the principal, and the choice is, in every respect, yours to make.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
