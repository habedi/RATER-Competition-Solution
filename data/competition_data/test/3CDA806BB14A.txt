I am Luke, I served as a Seagoing Cowboy. I think you should join this program because there are a lot of perks to it. My favorite part of being a Seagoing Cowboy would probably be helping people. I went out and looked for people in distress. I tried to help them as best as possible. I adored helping people even before I joined this group so I loved this part.

When I wasn't helping people I would treat my self to some site seeing. I loved seeing the Acropolis in Greece. That was my favorite! I also saw Europe, China, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, I saw an excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canal.

I also had a few scary times like one time I was just about to fall overboard on my night-watch, but this little piece of metal stopped me.

When I was on my way home and we had already loaded off all of the animals, I would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. I also read!

I kept going on these amazing trips and now I feel as if I have been everywhere! I'm sure that if you take this offer and join the Seagoing Cowboys then you will have plenty of stories to tell children and relatives.

Remember that all of this was a huge oppertunity for a small town boy like me. I was just a boy dreaming of changing the world and now I have lived that dream. Now it is time for me to help you live your dream!
