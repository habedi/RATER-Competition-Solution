I would rather use policy 1 cause, what if a student fall and gets heart and nobody can hear them yelling for help the can just call some one from there phone. What if the didn't get the home work in one class they can ask a friend on there free time what the home work was and they can tell them if they are on the other side of the school. It might cause some problems cause the would text in class. Some people will never stop using a phone and that might cause people to run into each other. If policy 2 students are not allowed to have phones at school is bad because, if something bad happens they cant call their parents or if something happens at there house there parents can call them. If they are texting in class the teacher should take away the phone and give it to them after class but if they keep getting caught the teacher should give it to there parents.
