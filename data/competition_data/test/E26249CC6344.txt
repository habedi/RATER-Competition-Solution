Home schooling is good for some people and bad for others it depends on on how they learn. Being at home most people couldn't focus, their would be to many distractions in a home. But at school a lot of things happen you can prevent a kid from getting bullyed by someone, or like catch a sickniss from somebody else you never know, somebody could be carrieing a virus or something. But learning from school is way is way easier because the teachers can teache easier, and if they over sleep because they don't have to go nowhere then they miss a day or don't do they work at home then gets held back because they have to much responseabilty. So going to school is good for a student so they can get more effective learning experience and they don't get held back for lack of work or in school time. If the student works best at home then let him becase it's mostlikely better for them if they chosed it or if parent chose it for them so. The school will offer safty at the school instead of your kid being at home with no one to watch them anything can happen to them. So what could be worse than coming to public school free food, free education, free security trust me come it would be much better to have your kid here than at home by them selves unlesss there is a home school teacher that you pay for but that coats a good amount of money a day so coming to public school would be the best move someone could someonne could make cheaper and better for any student. Plus your kid could get to know people and make friends instead of being alone for the school years they could be with they new friends and be out with them but thats also another reason to stay home becase the could take your kid down the wrong path and have them drugs or something and we wouldn't won't that for your kid we want whats best for even if that means home schooling them so that they get the education they for them to do good in life.
