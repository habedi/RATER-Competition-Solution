Is this technology in a classroom valuable? Would this be useful in a classroom? Does this effect the students?

This technology in a classroom is very valuable. In the article to author says " Eckman has classified six basic emotions--happiness,suprise,anger,digust,and sadness...". Technology like this is rare in a classroom so it would be valuable and also helpful for the students and also teachers in some type of way. A reason for it to helps students because in the article it says "... coulde recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," this mean it can help student on what they are cpnfused on so its helpful for the teachers an students.

I feel like this technology would be useful in so many ways. Imagine you being a teacher with over 25+ students, there is no way you can get to everyone fast in a hurry. With the technology being there it can also be its job to help the students understand what they are taught not only by the teacher. This technology takes lots of stress off of teachers backs by helping with students,but not also tht if a student is embarrassed to ask for hep the technology knows their feelings so it could notify the teacher about that. This technology would make a big change in schools.

This would effect the studets in a couple of ways. First, it effects them by giving them a better learning environment because your basically giving your communication to a computer. Second, this can effect student in some what a bad way. Some students get happy for new things and for this being cool and new it can effect them from learning and they would get easily distracted. This could be a good thing or bad things but would help the our learning environment.
