Do you believe that drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. I think that drivers should not be allowed to operate a cellular device while driving a vehicle. Using a cellphone while driving can cause a series of accidents and drivers wouldn't have their full attention on the road. The roads would be more safe, if drivers don't use cellphones while driving.

Most tragic car accidents are nearly caused by drivers using their cellphones. Studies show that fatal car accidents by teen drivers comes from them being distracted by their "phones". This is a very high percentage , considering that there are also adults that rarely text and drive then get into an accident. If we are to be more descriptive, "In 2017, 15,341 drivers aged 15-29 were involved in fatal crashes due to distraction or cell phone use." The more that young adults aren't exposed to the rights and wrongs of texting and driving, that percentage will rise. This is a serious risk factor, that could be elevated to the percentage that will cause the limits on cars to rise.

Another con when it comes to cellphone use while driving is the excessive use of "iphone holders". It may seem harmless, but in all reality, it can cause young adults, even adults and elders, to be at risk of an accident. What happens is that although the phone holder is put in place for people to see and interact with their phones without taking their eyes off the road, it is still seen as a temptation. For example, if an 18 year old is about to drive at a party, and is receiving multiple messages., while her phone holder is in place constantly seeing the message pop up, could lead to anticipation, and a risk, that could've been avoided. There are many ways that driving can be safe, without heading your phone!

Since I stand for less cellphone usage while driving, here are some of my personal tips that may help prevent not only young adults, but everyone from risking their lives. There is now built-in technology that can pick up your voice, activate GPS, and even reply to messages; It's called siri ! Siri is an apple product that is built within the Iphone.

In conclusion, this is why I believe texting and driving is not safe for anyone. We could save more lives if we put everything down. With this type of technology, it would make it easier to access things while you are on the road, and will, in the long run, will decrease the risk of accidents.

In conclusion, this is why I stand for young adults, even adults alone, should not use their cellular devices while driving. We shouldn't have to put our lives at risk for one simple text.
