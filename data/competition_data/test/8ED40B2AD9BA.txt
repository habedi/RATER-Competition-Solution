What if cars were never invented? What if cars were so much money no one will be able to buy them? Limiting the usage of cars can help the economy and help the environment in many ways. Places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota have banned the usage of cars. They say that since they have did that congestion in the cities have gone down. Polluted cities aren't as crowded as they use to since they have banned the usage of cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of the places that has banned the usage of cars. You can still own a car but there are only two places to park your car, large garages at the end of a development or buy a psace along with a home. In article one it stated that,  "More than 70 percent of Vauban's familis do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here," People siad that having a car was tense and kind of too much pressure when in a crowded city. In 2006 Vauban had become an example of  a growing trend in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, they have been the most advanced experiment in low car usage. Stores are placed on the walk away or on a main street, rather than in malls or on a distant highway.

Paris have a near-record pollution so they enfroced a partial drivning ban the clear some of the air in the global city. Motorists with even and odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home or they suffer and fine of 22-euros. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-sevn people had thier cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. Congestion was down nearly 60 percent in the capital of France after five days after the enforement of the driving fine. SInce Paris has generally more smog than other European capitals diesel fueal was blamed for it. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Delivery companies complained about the lost of revenue for cars. In aritcle two it siad, "Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday," the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered car plates on Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia have banned usage of cars for three years straight. Cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day. Thier goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Anybody that violated that suffered a fine of $25 dollars. Aritcle 3 buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said "It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," meaning that cutting down car usage with lower the greenhouse gases in the air and clear it up. Dyas without cars is a part of a improvement capaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s, it has been the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Parks and sport centers and have bulid throughout the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks, rush-hour restirctions have cut traffic dramatically, new resturants and upscale shopping ditstricts have cropped up. Bannig cars in Bogota has been the best thing that has ever happened to the city.

In 2013, President Obama had ambitious goals to curb the United States's greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that many Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. In article 4 it said that "as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995," part of that is because many Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Demographic shifts in the driving population have made the trend of banning car accelerate.

In conclusion, banning cars will a successful rate on not just the United States but the world. Maybe people should actually look and promote the idea to see if it will help our economy and or environment. Without cars polluted cities will be able to breath fresh air and won't have to worry about payign for gas. Banning cars could be the best thing that will happen to the world.
