I'm going to have to go with policy 2. Students should already know the school is not a place for cell phones. School is a place for learning, not to text and call people. It's preparing you for your future. And if you decide to let students have their phones during school it will be a large distraction. Since I'm a student I must admit that students aren't going to respect the 1st policy. If they have a chance to have their phones out they will take it and take advantage of it. I believe we should just stick with the policy of having no phones in school. We will have time before and after school to text and associate with our friends. Letting us have our phones during school is like giving us a chance to not learn. Which isn't the point of school. Students who decide to focus on their phones aren't going to be doing their work at all. Letting us use our phones during school is an opportunity for us to cheat to get answers on a quiz or test. Or the cell phones may cause drama from outside the schools. I Just think we shouldn't be able to use our phones at all during school. We can live without them to focus on our education.
