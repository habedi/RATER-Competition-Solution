The author feels that Venus has much potential of we explore it and overcome it's dificulties. The author also feels that the exploration of Venus was once like Earth and can hold many secrets.

The author thinks it is a good idea to explore Venus because it may have been an Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author says, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth," (4). The author explains that Venus was likely a planet similar to Earth today. If we learned about why Venus has taken up such harsh conditions, we may be able to predict the way Earth will die.

The author says that even though the conditions on Venus are harsh, we would be able to get vast amounts of solar energy from the planet. The text says, "Solar power would be plantiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans," (5). The author thinks that even though the conditions are harsh, it is worth the risk. If we are able to collect the large amounts of solar energy from Venus, then we could help power our planet when we rus out of non renewable resources, making it worth the risk of traveling to Venus.

In conclusion, the author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because we could learn about future evnts on Earth and also help our planet by harvesting energy from the solar power on Veunus that wouln't be accesible here on Earth.
