Dear principle

I think that it is a good idea to put the students to pick up the litter because that way when somebody passes by the street or something they can be able to find it clean. i also think that it could help save the earth and its less pollution. the students in school might think that its a waste of time but to me i think it a great think to do. another think thing is that some students that need to do community service for what ever reason that can be one of the choice that they have. a lot of people when they are coming from another state or country can see that there may be a lot of trash in the streets for example there some bottles, paper, plastic, and a lot of things that can harm the animals. when the people help pick it up its helping the animals around that area and it also helps the plants and trees that is what we need to live but also by picking up the litter that also helps for us to live because its less pollution. the students without the other people telling them what to do they should know that throwing trash is bad for our environment. also when somebody sees that another person is throwing something and just leaves it in the street without picking it up that other person should say "hey can you please pick that up and throw it away in the trash can". if in this world people cared about the earth they would do anything to keep it safe and clean. so principal i think that putting students that can to pick up the litter is a very great idea. that way they can at least try to pick it up every once in a while, they could also get different students every time. and also they can kind of separate the students with one of the grown ups to different places so that way the grown up can take them to pick up the litter. it would be a good way to keep this earth more clean. i agree with putting students to pick up litter. and i would also like to help pick it up or get people to help th
