In the artical the author decribes that Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) can help to identify human emotional expressions. Profeser Thomas works with another guy named profeser Nicu. Profeser Nicu was from the University of Ansterdam. I'm against the vaule of using computer techonology to read students emotions.

One example that the authour gives is where the process begins. The text states" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D coumputer model of the face". The FACS has classifies six basic emotions which are: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These emotions are associted with the movement of the facial muscles

Another example that the author gives is web ads on your screen. The text says "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a simalr might follow. Most student thay communicate is nonverbal. Dr. Haung put that video games and surgery on his notes.

One vaule of haveing techonlogy might help teachers know what students might be feeling even if the student doesn't want them to know. If the student is feeling sad or stressed the teacher can help with that through communication. Empathy is (feeling someone else's emotional state).

To wrap every thing up some people would like to have this techonlogy, but there are some people who don't. The people who would like it thinks it might help them find out what their kids or kid is felling and help them out; however, the people who don't think it would beause they hope the kids would come and coummunicate with them indsted of them finding out on a technlogy coumputer.
