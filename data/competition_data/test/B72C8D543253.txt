I agree with the idea about how kids should have at least one extracurricular activity at school like sports or clubs at school.

There are many reasons why extracurricular activities are a great idea for students, like homework club where you can work with your friends and finish any not finished or late work and work on your homework or any projects and once you finish with your homework you can help your friends with their home work and you can work with your teachers and work with anybody else who can help you with skills for homework and test and who can help you study for them.

Another activity is playing sports at the gym you are able to play basketball, soccer, football, and more and whichever sport you want to play ask some friends to play with you and your friends could practice and get better at the sport and if you et a lot better maybe you could join your schools basketball or football team which counts as another activity and if you do join the team you can get to meet and know more about new people and your coach and they can help with some tips and ways to get better at the game, but always remember to have fun.

Next, you can join year book club where you and a group of people and work on making he year book, there is probably gonna be new people, so you can try making new friends and you guys can try making ideas about how the year book could look like and how you guys would set it up and at the same time having fun with your friends make crazy or funny ideas.

This club is really helpful with joining a school team and it is in high school, there is a weight lifting club which can really help you with your arm and leg muscles and body muscles too, it's very helpful because if your gonna join a school team or any team in general, your gonna need to be strong especially with football because you need to be strong to tackle people or to take hard tackles and your gonna need to run fast so your gonna need strong legs and your gonna need strong legs in basketball because when you need to jump you can jump high so you don't get blocked and strong arms to shove through people when you going for a drive to the basket, there are many things this club can help wit and it can really help your body stay in shape, so when you do play sports are not gonna be weak and easily get hurt or easily get taken down.

These and many other clubs can be very fun and is a way of learning new things, trying new things, and starting new hobbies for your future and doing these clubs especially help with being social and talk to others and when working together you learn to communicate and be a great team with friends and clubs can help you learn and be better at new things. Also, it can interest you into things for the future since at that point you are gonna be more skilled and more comfortable with what you are doing and you actually know what you are doing.

Lastly, clubs are great way to spend your free time like when you have nothing to do at home, so I agree with the principal that we should at least have one extracurricular activity because they can really help us in many ways of learning new things, trying new things, and choose what we really like and enjoy and you just might find out something you didn't know you could do.
