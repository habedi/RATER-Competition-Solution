Have you ever wondered if the face on Mars was created by aliens? The face on Mars was not created by aliens it is a natural landform. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team got a picture of the face that was good enough to see that the face had no alien monument.

Some people think the face on Mars is created by aliens or think it's bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Scientist Michael Malin found out the right answer. That the face is a natural landform. The camera Michael and his team used was 10 times better than the one used to take the photo of the face in 1976. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program says "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" That quote shows how good the camera is.

Today, people still belive it was aliens who made the face on Mars. But what they dont know is that its really just a landform, thanks to Michael Malin and his MOC team we now know the truth.
