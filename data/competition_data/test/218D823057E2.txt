To the Principal,

Community service is a great way to help others in need in the community, hence the name community service.

Also, community service would help to make the community a better place.

It would be a great idea to require students to perform community service to give something back to the community they belong to.

Most students perform community service on their own without being required, so it would only effect them in one positive way.

These students would be recognized for their hard work that prior to the requirement would have been ignored.

Requiring community service will also make the school look better because most students would be well-rounded, something colleges look for in students.

Being a well-rounded student will help them get into colleges because if they can participate in the community, keep up their grades, and do a sport, they are practicing good time management, a necessary skill in the later years in school as well as in the workplace.

Helping the community is very important and can even be enjoyable.

As long as students are able to pick their own project, it is more than likely they will enjoy participating in the community.

My friends who are involved in community service think it is very important, and so do I.

Some of those friends wish they were recognized, but don't want to bring that up because they don't want to say it in a way that they are only doing it for the recognition.

If all students were doing community service, the community would be a much better place.

Some students honestly think community service is just a distraction from what they want or "need" to do.

These students most of all need to be required to do some community service because they are not well-rounded students and they should be shown what it's like to do community service.

They have no idea what it would be like if nobody picked up litter or helped tutor elementary school children.

These children who were neglected in the sense of education would not know what's going on in school and both the student and the school would suffer.

Eventually, choosing to not do community service will catch up with them and penalize them specifically, weather it's in college or when the school district does not perform it's best on tests like the NAEP and the MEAP, and the school district is rated lower than it was previously and teachers are forced to take the school day reviewing concepts the incoming students were supposed to have prior to that class.

With all due respect,

A concerned student
