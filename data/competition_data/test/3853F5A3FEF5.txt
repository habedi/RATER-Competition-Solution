Have you ever heard about a face on Mars? Do you believe it or not? Well some say that a picture was captured on Mars claiming that it is was a face created by Aliens. But on the other hand some say it is just a natural landform on Mars. But in this article I will be proving that the face is just a natural landform.

The face on Mars is just a natural landform because scientist figured out that it was just another martian mesa. Only a shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. After they dicovered that, a few days later NASA put the 1976 picture out to the public also saying "huge rock formation... which resembles as a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth." On April 5, 1998 team snapped pictures ten times better then the first one but the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. On April 8, 2001 they tried again on a cloudless summer day. The team captured an extraodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butter messa, landforms common around the American West. So there you have it the mask on Mars was just a natural landform.

So have you ever heard of the face on Mars? Do you belive it? The face on Mars was jsut a natural landform proven by NASA.
