The driveless cars have both pros and cons. The car would use less fuel then it does today and taxis offer more flexibility than a bus. The cars alert the driver to take ove when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. General Motors had created a concept car that could only run on a special test track , but the track was to expensive to be practical. Instead of smarter roads smart cars were made. If people wanted to look at this in a psychological aspect, this would make driving more fun. The car options for this program can be turned off when the driver needs to take over and this can be used as a safety issue. This program can help with keeping passengers safe especially the ones who make poor choices. This would help on traffic and accidents.
