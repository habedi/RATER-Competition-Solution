My name is STUDENT_NAME and i think the first policy is a great idea. I think students should be allowed to use there phones during class, I think we should be allowed to use any electronic or wireless device. Sometimes we have nothing to do at all so why cant we just text are friends or listen to are ipod's they don't bother anyone at all. Teacher's should only take them up if there being a distraction to other student's but other than that they don't bother anyone. Another thing were always on are phones anyway' s, people always text in class even though there not suppose to there is no purpose for these kids not to have there electronics out what if it's an emergency? Then we should have them out without teacher's yelling and doing what they do when we have them out. Lunch is a perfect hour to have them out I know it would make us less loud because we'd be entertained with are electronics. Everyone take them out anyway' s and just hide them when a teacher or anyone that might take it up come by. I think we should just try it and see how it goes, if we decide to make a bad decision we get are privilege taken away.

When it's time for class we put them up, and concentrate. For a fact I know I would be concentrated and quiet if I can listen to my ipod during a test or study time as for my phone I would only pull that out if I got a text or A call. Phone's should be allowed because are parents bought it for us to use not to just have in a bag or pocket to look cute, like we can dye are hair or wear accessories we can have are phones out there's no point of us not having are electronic' s out. If we don't want to listen we wont it's are choice, Whoever made this law up not to have electronics out is a hypocrite because for a fact he or she's writing it on a laptop, has his or hers phone out calling his or her' s employees or co-workers. The government sale's these electronics and now they want to say we can't use them in certain places it's pointless. It's like a drug addict wants to do drugs but he cant do it in this country even though he's doing it anyways if they say we have the freedom to do what we want in this country we should stand up for are right's and have are electronics out. I'm STUDENT_NAME and I agree to this policy.

Closing,
