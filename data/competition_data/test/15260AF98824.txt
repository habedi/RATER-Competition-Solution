I think that all students that have a cell phone should be able to use it during free time because it will help them communicate more and keep them busy. It is only fare that students should be able to have cell phone at school, then not have any cell phones at school at all. If teachers can have cell phones at school so can the students. I think if a teachers phone goes off in class that the students phone can go off in class because it is only fare, I also believe that if a student needs to be able to talk to their parents during lunch or any free time they should be able to.

My reasons for this are because if there is an emergency they should be able to talk to a parent or call for help even call a friend to help or do something about the situation or problem. Another reason is so the student can be able to hang out or be in touch with other people or let someone now if things are ok. One more reason for this choose is because kids and teens need to have a life and be free and who they want to be.

Another idea is so the student can let a parent or guardian know if they have to stay after school or even let a friend now to met him /her at a certain location after school. I also think that we should have a certain perspective on how the teachers use there phone at school. All kids and teens want to do is be on there cell phone at lunch or free time. some students even use their phone during class without teachers knowing or even during p. e.

There should be a certain limit to where kids can use there cell phones and to where teachers can use there cell phones. Only the teacher or student can say whether they want to stop using there cell phone or even bring one to school. only a student or teacher can use a phine at school.
