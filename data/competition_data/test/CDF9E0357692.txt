Do you think that Venus is worth exploring? Well in the story, " The Challenge of Exploring Venus," it tells you how scientists are trying to explore Venus. Venus is called the,"Evening Star," because of how we can see it as the brightest point in the night. Venus is also, a planet that no human can survive on; the planet is hot, and has high pressure. The conditions far more dangerous than any human has done on earth.

However, the challenge of finding what this planet has and, how it can help us on earth. Has made scientists want to find out about this more. Imagine someone has finally, found something on Venus; everyone would be amazed by it. That is why they want to find out about Venus even if it dangerous.

Although, Venus is a planet that we can not land on without burning. Scientist have reason on trying to find out about this planet. For example, Venus is referred to Earth's "twin," because it has the same density, size, and closest to earth,even if something we are closer to Mars, because of the speed of the earth. However, because Venus is more like earth scientist think that their is a posibility that is we might need to move to another planet. Venus might be the better option than any other planet. That is why scientist want to know.

All in all, even if scientist think it's impossible to find something about Venus, they will try and figure out. It might be hard but, I believe that people like challenges. Even if we can not there might something they can do, like make a robot that can stand hot and high pressure.
