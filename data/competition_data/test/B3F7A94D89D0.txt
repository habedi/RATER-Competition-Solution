Reasons to Join the Seagoing Cowboys Program!

One reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because, you get to help people. Helping people is a good deed so why not. The Seagoing program has many people help others. Luke says," There where 44 nations that came to help care for people that needed animals, food, and shelter."

You should also join the program because you can visit unique places. Luke said that he got to see the Acropolis in Greese which was special. Luke said, " I got to go to Europe, China, and Greese." I think that it would be fun to go to those places. It would also be like a vacation but not.

Another reason to join the Seagoing program is because you won't be alone. Luke said, " There where 44 nations helping in the Seagoing Cowboy program."

I personally think that you can make a great impact on others.

One more reason why I would join the program is because I like helping others. I aslo think it would be fun to go to different places. My final reason is because I have always wanted to be in the army and save people or places from destruction.
