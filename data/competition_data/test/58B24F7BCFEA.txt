Some kids already participate in extracurricular activities but shouldn't everyone? Children now get involved less and less then they used to. Now we have phones, television, etc. Children would rather be at home rather then going out to meet new people and hangout with friends. Thats why I think that all students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it could help them to try new things and to make new friends.

Children could try so many new things if they participated in extracurricular activities. When choosing what to do as an activity the options are endless. This will let children have the option to do whatever they would like! They can try a new sport or club, maybe even take lessons to learn a new instrument. Having children do activities outside of school can let them find who they want to be and express it. When kids have he option to do whatever they would like it could open doors to new things they might enjoy.

If a child participates in extracurricular activities it could help them to make new friends. While participating in a group activity outside of school kids can meet lots of new people. With most extracurricular activitiesÂ children work together to help each other. This gives children the chance to talk and get to know each other better. When meeting new people it gives children the chance to find the right people who can help them be to themselves.

Overall, I think that participating in an extracurricular can be good for kids. They have an endless amount of options for things they can do. Children may also make some new friends too! In conclusion, I agree that all students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular because it can help them try new things and also to make new friends.
