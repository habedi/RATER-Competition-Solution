First,there has never been any realistic shows of life on Mars. Nobody has ever seen an alien before. Also there has been a lot of "alien sightings" all around the world that were just modern day things. Like a towel rack,a plate,a light,a lawn mower,or even a box of cereal. The eyes can deceive in some areas and make you think you see something when you really don't.

Some landforms are formed by the planet itself. As it states in paragraph 7,"Thousands of axious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web sit,revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." Proving that the Face was just a natural landform on the planet Mars and not some kind of "alien monument". Sometimes the eyes can deceive you to make you think your looking at something your really not looking at. Those were one of those times.

Not only did that hurt NASA's reputation,it educated others on how there isn't life on Mars and there probably will never be life on Mars. It also tought NASA a lesson to gather more information and make sure that they know what they are doing, and what they are really investigating before they reach anything out to the public. Nevertheless ,in my opinion and based on the facts I've read. I don't believe that there is life on Mars.
