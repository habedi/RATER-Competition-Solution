Driverless cars can be a good thing. If we have these cars and they are made so we dont have to have to steer. There are many good reasons why we should have these cars and fund them. In the next paragrah i will explain why i feel that reason for you.

What would it be like with driverless cars? The world today would need something like this because then there wouldnt be any crashes as bad as there is. Yes as of right now why would people want a driverless car that needs a driver still? Well if we put are money and the best people we have one it we will make the would a better place. If we make it so that all us humans would have to do is sit in the passanger seat, we would make it a safer place to walk,driver,ride bike, and/or doanything.

We can make the BMW life savers. We wont have many texting and driving,talking on the cellphones while driving. The driving world as we know it will never be as safe as it will be with driverless cars. Yes not many people could buy it because it cost alot of money but they wont care because those peoples kids can walk the streets anthey wont worrie about the kids getting hit or anything.

When we get driverless cars will there be many car crashes?? The answer to that question is no. With the driverless cars they will have sensors that will make the car brake before hitting the other car there for; it will be much safer with driverless cars. If people think this is a bad idea they are wrong and dont understand how safer this will be for everyone.

I am all for the driverless cars with everything i have. Driverless cars will make the world a much safer place. Yes it needs some more work to become fully driverless but we can and will make this happen. We will make the world a safer place and a much more relaxted place.
