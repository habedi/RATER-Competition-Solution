The use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts." This is important because some students wont ask for help when they are confused or troubled. Secondly, more than often when a student is bored they will fall asleep causing them to miss important information. "By weighing the different units, the software can even recognize mixed emotions."So if a student is a little cofused the software wont make it "just so easy" but it'll reduce the challenge.

If uniterested in the subject at hand or with the class as a whole they will become unattached an fail the class potentially causing them not to graduate. "then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." By modifying the subject or lesson it could make it easier or make it harder for a student in class. If a person seems to be frowning the software could ease up. Also if the student is having a good time with the software it's a possability that it could make it a little harder.

Even people that dont use much emotion in their face the software will still be able to calculate their emotions. "The facial expressions for each emotions are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression." So if a student isn't very exspressive this software will still be able to calculate their emotions with the slightest movement of their facial structor. "Each expression is compared against a neutral face." So even the slightest change is detected. When detected the software will switch the level of challenge.

In closing this software is a very important improvement to schools everywhere. The software will help you stay interested and connected with the lesson.
