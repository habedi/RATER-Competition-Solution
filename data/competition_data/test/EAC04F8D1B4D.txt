Throughout this article, we learn a new technology called "The Facial Action Coding System." This system is used to identify human emotions. Now, the real question is if this technology is valuable to the students in a classroom.

Is the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students valuable in the classroom. To begin with, a classroom computer could recognize the students emotions. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."

On the otherhand, the software might not be so great. Throughout the text, the scientists state that the emotions are universal, and that everyone has the same few emotions. "Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..." "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Haung. What if the machine predicts, or reads the expression wrong, than what? Not everybody's expressions are the same, some may vary, and with only six basic emotions, the machine may not be able to properly read what a person is feeling.

In summary, I have come to the conclusion that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is very valuable. Not other can it read their emotions, but it can improve their learning experience. Their are a few things that the machine may not be able to do, and a small chance of error whilst reading an emotion. But, overall, the technology is valuable to students of the classroom.
