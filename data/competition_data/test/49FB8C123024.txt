How do you feel about our voting system today? Today our current voting system consists of electoral colleges that vote for there certain president depending on your votes for president. We have had this system since the begaining of voting for president for our country. Some believe that our country recieves harm as far as our selection for president goes. What they mean by this is that it all pretty much relies on the electoral colleges to vote our president. The problem with this is that people think that the president should be chose from popular vote, not from the electoral colleges. The thing with this is the our favors can be easily swayed due to the smart and cleverly designed ads during there campaign for president. Now see this wouldnt be a problem except that these advertisements arent always true and could sway our vote for the wrong reasons. This where the elctoral colleges come into play, they limit the amount of votes each president gets by the state. The electoral votes are then distributed to each candidate according to the amount of votes each one gets in the state. If we left it to just popular vote, the new president could just be decided by a couple clever ads and not there actual reasons for running, and what there gonna do for the country. all this being said i do think the amount of electorl votes shouldnt change due to the size of the sate so everyone has a fair chance. Honestly i think the electoral vote system works like a charm and would side with it opposed to the popular vote side of things.
