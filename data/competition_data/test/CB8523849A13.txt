A world without cars is kind of hard to imagine right? Well not for most countreis anymore. Cars are becoming less and less desirable as the years go on. The peak was in 2005 and then has been slowly decreasing. Younger people like the ideas of cars but don't really need one. New York has subways, taxi's, and others are carpooling toÂ  destinations. France has alreayd issued a ban on cars and has even had certain cars banned on certain days. For instance, even number car plates could not be used for driving on Monday's, odd number plates were banned for Tuesday's. This was to help reduce the amount of smog in the French air as they rely mostly on diesel rather than gas. In Vauban, Germany street parking, driveways and home garages have been banned from neighborhoods. You could now only buy a house with a garage for $40,000. This cause more people to stop using cars, and others to sell them to live in the upscale neighborhoods. Many of the Ford and Mercedes car dealerships are considering changing their train of car producing to the newer ideal of intertiwning public transportation with the up and coming ideas of bikers on the rodes, and people using buses and subways instead of their own cars.

In Paris the smog in the air was soon thicker than it was in Beijing, China the citied known for its polluted air. Soon Parisian officials enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the smog. Monday's, motorists with even-numbered plates had been ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, which is also $31. The same requirements were set in place for odd-numbered plates the following day. The first time this new ban was enforced nearly 4,000 dirvers were fined. Some even had their cars impounded for thier reaction to the new fine. The amount of traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after the five days of an intensifying smog. The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days that caused the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions. Diesel fuel was, of course, blammed as France has a tax policy for diesel fuel over gassoline. 67 percent of vehicles in Frane, compared to the 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris would typically have more smog than the other European countries with the percentage of diesel fule they use daily. Paris had 147 micrograms of diesel per cubic meter last week compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Delivery companies lost revenue, but this starte an exception for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Soon the smog had cleared anouth on Monday for the ruling French party to take away the ban for odd-numbers plates on Tuesday.

The United States has long since been one of the world's prime car cultures. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse has emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitious assist from a incipient shift in American behavior.
