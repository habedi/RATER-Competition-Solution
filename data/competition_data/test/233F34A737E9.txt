Some schools require many projects over the summer. Reasons for this may vary, but they all share one thing in common; Who designs these projects? Schools often bring this idea into thought as they switch their deigns of these projects year to year. In fact, students often wonder why this is the case. I believe school summer projects should be consistent and always be designed by a teacher because it creates an equal learning objective, strong motivation from a teacher, and help and guidance on making sure a project is done correctly.

With student deigned projects, students often do not meet their set learning objective of their class. Some students gain the objective and learn,but some fail and do not meet the objective because they learn a different topic. Because of this, students should follow a teacher designed project to create an equal learning environment, ensuring all students learn the same learning material. Summer projects are meant to help students continue learning during a break, without a certain objective being designed by a teacher, students often will no achieve the meaning of a summer project.

Over a long break, many students do not have strong motivation to complete and learn a project. Whether it is because a student is confused or doesn't have good management, Students often find themselves in need of greater help from teachers as a way to successfully learn from a project. In school, teachers are often seen as great influences in the classroom, ensuring greatness from each and every student. However, at home, students often are not kept at the same standards of learning. With teacher designed projects, this would create a vast way for students to become motivated and successful, in order to follow their teachers project.

Help is often hard to find at home. Many students do not have great resources at home. For example, parents often cannot answer questions about a school project, due to their lack of knowledge of the classroom. With a teacher being the designer for a school summer project, students have a reliable resource for help on what to do. This guidance from a reliable resource makes summer project much easier for a student, as they would have a teacher to help them succeed in a set project.

While teacher-designed projects have set rules and can be seen as useful, student-designed projects can also be seen as helpful, as they can give a student freedom on what to do and how to do it. Student-designed projects do not hold a student back from doing a project a certain way, as every student learns differently. However, I still believe all summer projects should be designed by a teacher to assure great continual learning during a break. Teacher-deigned projects create a strong learning objective, a great source of motivation, and strong help and guidance for all students to follow.
