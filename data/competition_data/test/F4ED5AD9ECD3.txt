In 1976, NASA found something pretty odd on Mars. What you may ask? They call it the Face on Mars. NASA has took new high-resolution images to study. People believe it was created by aliens, other people believe it's just a natural landform. On May 24, 2001 NASA noticed something strange. So they snapped some photos and they spotted a shadow likeness of a human face. But that is just shadows. Scientists soon figured out it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. Maybe it is just an illusion. But the Face on Mars has become a pop icon, featured in movies and books. This is likely to just be a conspriracy theory. NASA noticed that there was no ancient civilization on Mars at any time in the past. Only few scientists believed it was an alien artifact.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the firdt time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharper than the original ones. Anxious web surfers waited until the image appeared on the JPL wesite...sadly for them, it was a natural landform. No one was satisfied. Skeptics say that the alien marking were " hidden by haze." All these facts did'nt stop mission controllers. The mission controllers got prepared to look again. They state that they don't pass the Face often.

There is alot more ways to prove that the Face is just a landform, and not something created by aliens. NASA has done tons of research to prove it is a natural landform. NASA took years to find out what it was. It might be shaped as a face, but it was'nt created by aliens. Would'nt you think that if aliens were on Mars they would've created more things? They searched and searched but there was'nt anything odd about

Mars. So why would you be worried about a landform? So if you plan on thinking the Face on Mars was created by aliens, just ask yourself " How?" We all have illusions that our mind trick us about, maybe this is yours.
