Dear Ms. Principal,

I strongly disagree with your policy. Every student, no matter your grade average, should be able to participate in after-school activities. It's not fair to those who do better in sports then academics! Maybe if the policy was changed into something else, like if you're late to class for a number of times, then you don't get to participate in activities. But grades are not a good place to judge a student. And you, being the principal, should know what the kids in this school are getting. Many of them of getting a C average. It's not fair to half the school not let them join the clubs or activities. So in my opinion, I disagree with the policy.

Maybe you can use this policy as a punishment to those who don't follow school rules. Like if a student is late to class every day, their activities and sports privilege is taken away until he/she is no longer late on a daily basis. Another time where this policy can act as a punishment is if the student gets detention a number of times. Then their privilege is also taken away. Instead of not allowing the students with bad grades to participate in these activities, make the students that are bad and needs to disciplined to take the punishment. Then this is much more fair to those with below a grade B average.

Students deserve to join these fun activities and the sports of their choice. This is what most students look forward to on days where they have extracurricular activities. It'll be such a shame to take that away from a student just because of their grades. It' not fair to them. Sometimes, grades are purely the teacher's choice. Like the amount of extra credit you deserve, or the points taken off on your project, this is your teacher's choice, not the student's. If the student did a 100 point project and the teacher took off ten points because he/she thought it wasn't neat enough, it's the teacher's choice. So taking away the fun activities is not fair to those whose teacher are strict with points.

There is one thing in your policy that I agree with though. Students who average a D or an F in their report cards for more then two quarters need to have words spoken to. To those students who average a D or F will get consequences. The consequences may include taking away their extracurricular privileges. Until they get at least a +D or C on their report card, they can't participate in the sports or activities. I, as a student, understand that students can't always control their grades. But when their grades are so low that get a F, something is definitely wrong. This is the time to not let them

There could still be a policy on activities and sports, but it can't be on because the student's grades, unless their grades are so low, something has to be done. Otherwise, this policy should only take place on students who are naughty and ought to be taught. Since this policy has not yet taken action, maybe you can change it to something more reasonable. Not to be questioning your power, Ms. Principal, but it'll be much more fair to those with ok bad grades to those who really deserve to be taught a lesson or two. Because there's too many kids out there in this school who gets a C average, it'll be better this way. In my opinion.

Sincerely,

Your Student
