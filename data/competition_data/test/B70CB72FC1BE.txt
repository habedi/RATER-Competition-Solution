Dear Principal,

I think are school policy on cell phones should be policy one. I think it is alright for students to have there cell phones in class as long as there turned off or on silent. For example, what if there is an emergency and one of your family members is trying to reach you. I would never forgive myself if i could have stopped something but then i did not. Also it does not bother anyone if your using them in lunch or free periods where no one is working. It is your free time to do what you want and if you want to use it to text people or play around with your phone you should be able to. Also if you forgot something at home or something got rescheduled or you just found out about something you should tell who ever was going to pick you up to not come or if they were not picking you up then tell them to come.

Another good reason for this policy is that maybe not as many people will not follow the rule of no phones in class because they know they can do it without getting in trouble once they leave the class. For example, the teachers will not have to stop class as much and you will not have as many students in the office. That is a win, win for everyone. The day will be so much more relaxed and the students will not complain every day about not being able to use their cell phones. Also the students may do more of there homework because instead of trying to remember it they can write it down in their phone. For example if they still do not do it, they can not say they forgot because they were allowed to use their cell phones to write down the assignment. This would have less students miss assignments and have less students not do their work. This would make the students better academically too. Which would reflect better on you because then there is a good chance that they will score higher on tests that reflect the school. Again this is a win, win for everyone.

Another good reason is, lets say your person who drives you to and from school is running late or if there is an emergency they can text you saying they will not be able to pick you up. So instead of you not seeing them and walking, you can try to make other plans and arrangements. Also lets say there is a fight or something spilled in a hallway, you can text your friend to tell them to go the other way so there not late and so they do not get involved in it.

That is my argument of why i would select policy one over policy two.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
