Have you ever heard of the Face on Mars? It's a landform on Mars that, from certain angles, gives the illusion that it looks like a face. Some people believe, however, that this was actually an alien creation. The Face on Mars is just a landform because it looks similar to landforms on Earth, only at certain angles does it look like a face, and high quality pictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform.

The Face on Mars is similar to landforms here on Earth. One scientist, Garvin, states, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho" (12). Only at certain angles does the landform look like a face. The author of the article states, "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face" (8). High quality ppictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform. In paragraph 11, The scientist says, "...you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were" (11).

The reasons that the Face on Mars is just another landform are that it looks like landforms on Earth, only certain angles show the Face, and high quality photos of the Face prove that fact. conspiracy theories are wrong because they don't have any facts to back up that this could be created by aliens. This is why the Face on Mars is not created by aliens, but by natural forces on the red planet.
