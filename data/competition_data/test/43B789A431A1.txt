I am going to give you reasons why you should join the seagoing Cowboys program.1 you should enter cause you can go to different countries and cities. We also get to help people who were in the war and their town so that's a lot of fun. When you see the smile on the people's face it makes you feel good. Another reason you should join is cause we get to get on boats and feed and water animals,but it just takes so long to get to our destination. Its really fun if you are at home helping you can help here we need any and everyone who wants to help. There can be bad days where lets say you are on the night shift so you fall and break something. Well that means you can just sit down or try to help somewhere else. There can be bad and good days but mostly good outs here you can have so much free time cause we are on the boat a lot. Sometimes we go to countries who just had fought a war so it's just nice to go and try to help them recover. This offer is an opportunity of a lifetime you won't have as much fun anywhere than here.
