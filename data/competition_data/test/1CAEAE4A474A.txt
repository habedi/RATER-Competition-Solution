Dear Principal:

Many people love playing sports, sometimes they love it so much they don't think about how they are doing in school. Changing the school policy so that you have to have at least a grade B average can be good for these people. It would be good because most people would do better in school, they would think more about school, and they would work harder.

Many students have a grade C average, with this policy most of those C averages most likely would go up to B averages. This is because there are most likely a lot of people who love sports and if they want to show that they love them they will raise their grades to be able to play those sports or activities. People like to have fun and they would know in order to have fun they need a good grade.

Thinking about school is something that helps when you're trying to get good grades. Once you start thinking about school you start working harder to do your best. Thinking about keeping a good grade makes people think about school more which they need to do so they can do their best in order to live their dreams of growing up and having a good paying job.

Lastly, people would work harder in school. Working harder in school is essential to getting good grades and, in this case, doing something you love to do. When people work harder in school then they will be more prepared for what's ahead of them like college, work, anything that requires skill and knowledge. Once you know how to work hard and do your best you are ready for almost anything.

In my opinion this policy change sounds perfect for a school. People will do better in school, think more about school, and work harder. All of these things will help them in their future in many different ways. This is a very good policy.
