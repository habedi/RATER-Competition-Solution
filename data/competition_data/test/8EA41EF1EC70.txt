I disagree with this statement because I feel like kids are tried after school and they want to go home and take a nap. A lot of people are busy and don't have time to do anything else because they are busy with there lives. It's hard to do anything else when you have a lot of homework and you have to get ready for school the next day.

When you get into middle school and high school you have a lot of homework more then you had in elementary school. You just don't really have time to do any thing because you are always busy with homework. I also think that if kids worked a little hard they wouldn't have much homework then they could do something. We would try are best in school.

The other reason I disagree with this statement is that kids should be active but a lot of people's parents don't have the money or time to drive them everywhere. Most parents just don't get off of work in time to drop there kids off. I would want my kid to do something active but I wouldn't have the time to drive everywhere.

I think that most kids get there energy out in the day in school running around in gym and running around outside. I think that most kids want to go home and go to bed. I think they would just be tired to play any sports or do anything. This is why I disagree with this statement.
