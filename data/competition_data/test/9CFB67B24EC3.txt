Dear principal

I think that helping the environment is very important and needed. I think that we should have community service that's one way to help the world turn around by making good choices one at a time .I can support my answer and why i think we should have community service ,because the world is an beautiful and wonderful place and we should have more sense and start acting like it .Helping younger children ,cleaning up around our schools is making our schools look good .Elementary children look up to us 8th,7th and 6th graders middle school is the beginning of starting a better life .You help one and you can help others. ex. like one spark of fire can start a house fire it spreads . One by one students start community service and that's leads to a better and more rewarding future .Looking at us 8th graders now how much we have grown. Community service is a perfect way to keep us on the track to success .We can keep all the bad surrounding away from us and start new better and achieving life style .
