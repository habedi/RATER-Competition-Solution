Do you believe driverless cars are really safe? Even though driverless cars could be very helpful to people in some situations, I am against the development for driverless cars. Driving isn't supposed to be fun, because driving should be safe at all times. In my opinion cars are at their zenith.

First of all, driving a car isn't supposed to be fun, it's suppose to be safe. With driverless cars you have to be alert 100 percent of the time because these cars aren't comepletely driverless. These cars could cause many accidents. If the driver isn't completey alert and if an accident is ahead what is the car supposed to do? When driving, the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are supposed to be safe. Can a car that is in control 90 percent of the time ensure that?

Secondly, cars are at the zentih of development. Most cars today have everything you need to be, "safe". Cars today have radar sensors, position- estimating sensors, a video camera mounted near the rear view mirror, a GPS receiver, and a Dubbed Lidar. All of those things promote safety when driving. The person driving doesn't have to know when to take control of the vehicle because they are already in control. What more could a car possibly need?

I am against the development of driverless cars. Cars are already developed and shouldn't need anymore done to them. They are safe enough. Driving isn't supposed to be fun. These cares could cause accidents if the driver isn't completely alert. Everyone on the road is supposed to be safe.
