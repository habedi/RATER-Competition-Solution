The face of Mars was not created by Aliens. It just happens to be a natural landform that resembles a human face. Although it has human features like the head, eyes, nose, and mouth, it is actually shadows that give it that illusion. The fact that it resembles a human head is a coincidence. If you use new high resloution images and 3D altimetry, you could see it for what it really is.

In addition, it has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and a haunted grocery store checkout line for 25 years. The fact that it has become a pop icon proves that many people have believed that the Face was concrete evidence that life had or have existed on Mars. Some people even believe that there is evidence NASA would rather hide, like conspiracy theorists, but meanwhile this all happening defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars which further proves that there is no ancient civilization on Mars.

Furthermore, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, but when it appeared on a JPL website, it revealed to be only a natural landform. This helps prove that there never was an alien momument in the first place. Although, not everybody was satisfied with this fact. They thought that perhaps that alien markings were hidden by the wispy clouds. In Malin's team's second look, they captured an extraordinary photo, but what the picture actually showed was the Martian equivalent of a mesa.

So in the end, there was no ancient civilization on Mars, no ancient momument, and the Face turned out to be only a mesa. Although many people still argue about life on Mars, there isn't enough research for it to be proven true or otherwise. The fact that the Face was mistaken was because people couldn't see it for what it truly was in the photo.
