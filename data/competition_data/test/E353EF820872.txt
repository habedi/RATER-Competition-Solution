As technological advancements increase, it is becoming easier for people to work and complete daily tasks from home. Whether it be joining a video conference or ordering groceries to one's front door, people do not need to leave their house nearly as often as they had in the past. Not only does this affect adults, but can also affect students trying to learn. Many schools give the option to allow students to learn from the comfort of their own home; however, learning from home is not nearly as useful as learning in school. Students with the ability to attend classes at a school would not benefit from attending classes from home because of the interactions made with real people.

Students can develop important social skills when at school. There are some skills that people cannot learn by someone teaching them. The only way to get or practice these skills is to learn from experience. This means one needs to be put in a situation where this skill is useful and try their best to learn from the experience. Learning to be social and to interact with others are some of these skills. The perfect place to practice these important skills is at school, where one is constantly surrounded by their peers. While at school, students are constantly put in situations that force them to interact with other students. Skills like these can be useful in future jobs and in a multitude of different situations in life. If students did not have to attend school to take classes, then they could grow up completely lacking these crucial skills. In order to prevent this anti-social future, students should go to school to take classes, where they benefit more.

Additionally, students learn more by directly interacting with teachers. Teachers are crucial assets to the future of the entire world. In order to continue advance society in many different ways, teachers are needed to educate children, teens, and young adults. To allow students to grow and develop in the best way possible, students need to have close and meaningful interactions with their teachers. Online or on a video call, students do not learn in the same beneficial way that students do in school. They do not receiveÂ the important interactions with their teachers. This leads to a lack of truly understanding and learning the material being taught. The only way to obtain this understanding is for students to have meaningful interaction with their educator. In all, students benefit far more from being educated in a school because they directly work and interact with their teacher.

It is important that some students, ones with disabilities or restrictions making it difficult to attend school, have access to classes from their homes. It is not fair for those who struggle to get from class to class or those who cannot get themselves to school to lose out on their educational opportunity our country gives them. In order to achieve true equity, it is only right that these students are given special exceptions. Even though learning online is not as beneficial to students as learning in person, for students that cannot go to school, a slightly limited education is much better than no education at all. However, this does not mean everyone should be able to learn at home, online, if they do not like going to school. Special circumstances should be made for those who need it, as allowing everyone to have an education is vital.

Everywhere around the globe, students should not take the opportunity of learning at a school for granted. Children, teens, and young adults truly benefit from interacting with their classmates and teachers. Even though online classes are very important, especially to those who cannot get to school everyday, what is learned in an actual school is far more significant for growing students. Now, the advancement in technology, like leaning online, is extremely useful for almost everybody on this planet, but humans cannot forget how to be social and how to interact with each other in real life. If people do forget these things, then society itself will be dead.
