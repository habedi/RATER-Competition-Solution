The face on the planet was just a landform. You might be able to see the face feom the landmark but there are always illusions. Some paintings are illusions and make you see two diffnerent things. This also one of things things its just an illusion.

We know that it is just a landform because we see them all the time here on planet earth. It is the same thing on Mars too. When we went in April in the year of 1998 it was winter of there. Which is a time for cloudy days. When we went The camara on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the so called face. We could have easily mistaken the shadows of the clouds for eyes, nose, and mouth like shapes. It could also maybe just have dents and or holes in the landform. It probabbly is just a level hill with a few holes or dents that would make it look like a a faceof a human. But we know its not a human face because how would people know whatwe look like. If they would look like us they would more then likely function like us too. So that would mean we clearly could go to mars too. But we can not so clearly no human like creature would make this.

In conclusion we know that it is a landform. People are seeing it from a bad view or looking at it the wrong way. In the future when we have a better picture and have a better view of it we will show the world it was a landform, but it was just seen wrong.
