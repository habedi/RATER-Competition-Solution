Dear Principal,

The rule on the policy that you must have a B grade point average to play sports or be in other activities is ridiculous i don't know if you are making this rule cause your being mean or you think if we all try hard enough we will succeed. But its not fair in my opinion. Yes some people don't put effort into their work and misbehave a lot but what about the people who are actually trying and still not averaging a B its not there fault and i' m sure they would like to try out for sports or try extra curricular activities.

Please sir reconsider this rule its bit much to ask from students of our age and work ability. Were teenagers this is the best time of our lives we want to go outside and hang out with friends and actually live. We already have to go to school for eight hours a day five days a week. Do you think we want to spend the time we have at home doing the work we got from school? we already have homework and test in eight different classes and to say we have to average a B in all those classes is going to put more pressure on us then we already have.

Its also about education what if a football player is not as smart as the others but he wants to go to college and he was hopping to get a scholarship from the school he wanted to attend by playing football but just cause he isn't averaging a B he cant play that sport and now he cant go to college. You just ruined his life. i' m not trying to make you feel bad or anything i' m just asking you to reconsider this rule before you make any final decisions. Thank you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
