The image that Viking 1 took in 1976 was a startling one to say the least. A rather creepy face looks up at the surveyor. It is as if someone built a face in the side of the planet. And many people did see it that way.

But as the descriprion says in the story "...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." So NASA the space program, states that it is meerly shadows and hills. I would think that they would be a more trust worthy source than anyone else telling you that this was an alien's doing.

Many people claimed that NASA was trying to hide this information but as the article states "...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." This is because in part they are probalbly intrieged by the idea of an alien civilization, but also because it would bring in a lot of buisness. The funds that it would bring in would be enourmous. I just cannot think of a reason why NASA would wan't to hide that.

Then again in 1997 NASA snapped another picture of it ten times as sharp as the last one. revealing rocks as can be seen in the picture. And still some were unhappy with the results and asked for more. In 2001, they got their results. NASA caught a picture with "maximum resolution" and it is evident in the picture that these are hills. They state in the article "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see waht they were!" It states in the article that it is like butte or mesa-landforms which can be found in Western America. These shapes are made on earth natrually. So why can't they be made on another planet natrually?

All the evidence points to a natrual land-scape on Mars. Anyone who would read this here would understand that. Every arguement made to disolve this has been met, crushed, and surpassed by another piece of EVIDENCE not claims or theories. So conclusion: Face on Mars is just rocks and shadows not alien life.
