Policy one

I agree with policy one, policy one stated " Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class." If i was a principal i would the students have a cellular device because I would want my child to have a cell phone to contact me .

Many parents would have there sent to school with a cell phone not just because to show friends but to contact them incase of an emergency or if they need something at a particular time. A cell phone can be used for entertainment for business or for personal reasons. Cell phones are meant to be used for communication but not to be used in class. School is more important than an cellular device school will help you achieve your personal goal so you can afford you own cell phone.

Spending time on your cell phone at lunch or outside will be find with me because your not in class disturbing nobody your with your friends and having fun. I would allow my students to explore on there cell phones when any free time is giving . The rules would be the same in the class no cell phones out when teaching in class. when students caught with the cell phone I will keep it until schools out then they come pick the phone up after school.

Another reason why children should have cell phones is Parents, teacher, principals and other staff members all have cell phones . sometime you might see your teacher her phone but when the student is on there cell phone they have to get there cell phone taken up which is not fair. The rules should inflict on the teachers as well as the students in the class room. If the teacher gives the students free time then there able to be on the phones.

A student having a cell phone out in class will cause consequences but when giving free time they will have the opportunity to be the cell phone. Cell phones are use for personal reasons and for contacting parents. This letter agrees with policy one un the passage .
