Whenever you get home, do you do your homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don't then you are either a very responsible kid, or you have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and the other half go home and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because it teaches the students responsibility, helps them with college later on, and they won't be on their phones all day.

One reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach them to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while they are still in school, it will help them succeed in their later life as an adult.

Another reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can help with finding a college later on in life. If you chose a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really help you in the future when you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are really good at a certain sport by the time of your sophomore year, you probably have a very high chance of making it on your school's team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if they think you are good enough for their school, they will probably offer you either a full-ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that they can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by "earth gov" asked adults which college they went to and if they were involved in an extracurricular activity during their high school years. About 90% of adults said that they got into college due to a extracurricular they were involved in during high school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.

On the other hand, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. They already have enough stress as it is, we don't need to add extra weight onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can help teens not spend the entire after school time on their phones. The article "Are Phones Good for Teens" writes, "most of all teens have access to a smart phone, and once they are let out of school and get home, the average teen spends 5 to 76 hours on their phone instead of doing their homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities." Another article titled "Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College" states that "when kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat they are deeply involved in extracurricular activites like sports, working on their school's yearbook, or being on the student council of their school." If the universe was filled with more kids like these then the world would have a larger population of successful young adults than it has right now.

In conclusion all students should be obliged to be involved in extracurricular activities becuase it helps them learn how to be responsible in their future life, it can help student get into a good college and be successful in life, and it can keep students off of their phones all day. To save our earth, the first step is saving the future generation.
