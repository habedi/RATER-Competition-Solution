Have you ever heard of the face on Mars? In 1976 the Viking 1 was going around Mars to look for a landing spot for Viking 2. They found something that looked to be a face. It was about 2 miles long in a region called Cydonia. The unusual shadows of the "face" made it look almost to be an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The scientists just figured it was another Martian mesa which were common to the region, but the caption took notes of a "huge rock formation, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." Nasa decided to take a closer look.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture 10 times sharper than the original photo. It turns out it was just a natural landform. Not everyone was happy though, they say it was too cloudy to see if there were any alien markings.

Once again on April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." The picture was so close that if there were anything on the ground we would've been able to see them. The picture shows the Martian is equivalent of a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, there were no alien momuments or anything weird happening. It was just a natural landform, although NASA wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars.
