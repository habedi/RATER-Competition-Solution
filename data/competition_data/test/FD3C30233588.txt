Have you ever wanted to ride the waves? Well, I did. I was a seagoing cowboy. My name is Luke. I think you will like seagoing Cowboys because you can visit cool places, have fun with other crew mates, and see cool things. Here is why you can see cool places.

When you are a seagoing cowboy, that means that you get to move cattle around on a boat and visit neat places. When I was a seagoing cowboy, I went to places like China and Greece. It was pretty cool, and I think you would like it if you try it. Now, I will tell you how to have fun with other crew mates.

After you drop the cattle off, you have some free space. To use that free space, me and my crew mates did a lot of fun activities. We boxed, we played baseball and volleyball, as well as table-tennis tournaments. It was really fun. Now is why you will see cool things.

When you are visiting places like China and Greece, you get to see cool things in those places. In Greece I saw the Acropolis. I also visited Venice, Italy, and went on a gondola ride. It was wonderful. I will now start to end.

While being a seagoing cowboy, you can see neat places. As well as neat places, cool structures. And, you can always have fun while doing this. I think that you should be a seagoing cowboy, it'll be the most fun you've ever had.
