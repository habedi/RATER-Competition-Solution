Dear TEACHER_NAME,

The phone is a true necessity indeed. It has established world wide communication, saved lives, and brought further advancement in technology. So what do I think of the phone? I believe it is a true tool indeed, and that it should be allowed in school, but only during free time. This is because phones help students communicate with their parents if they left something at home or need something, and the phone can also help improve student relationships by reducing social boundaries. Although you may say that the phone can increase bullying and other problems like sex ting, the technology that is available today can help diminish that by adding censors and what not.

Let's say this, OTHER_NAME

has left his language arts homework at home because he heard his bus roaring down the road and he had just woke up. So what does he do? Most likely it's rush out the door with as much of his essentials as possible, but he accidentally forgot his homework on his work desk. So as OTHER_NAME

arrives at school, he shuffles through his book bag and notices that his homework is missing, and the school's late work policy is cruel, stating that if work is late just one day, then it will not be accepted, but OTHER_NAME

here is very lucky, his language arts class is after one of the free time periods and he has a cell phone. So what does he do? He calls his parents for help and soon his mom comes to school with his homework and he gets an A. This goes to show how beneficial cell phones are at school during free time, but then, during the second free time of the day (lunch time), OTHER_NAME

doesn't have anybody to sit with.

Cell phones were originally designed for increased communication, but now with the introduction of new smart phones with instant messaging and other cool applications, they are now a social and business tool. OTHER_NAME

here can text his friends during lunch and say, "Hey, I'm sitting at lunch table B, come and join me over here so we can chat." So being his friends, they would most likely come over to his table and accompany him during lunch. So by the end of the day, everybody is happy. Except for the big, bad bully OTHER_NAME

who was jealous of OTHER_NAME

and his friends.

OTHER_NAME, being the bully he is, begins to go onto Face book during locker break (also a free time) and he begins posting horrible things onto OTHER_NAME

's wall. This might be your counter argument, but this isn't a strong argument. With the technology today, school's can place censors on radio waves. Meaning that if OTHER_NAME

here goes onto Face Book and posts, "OTHER_NAME

is such an idiot ." Then the censor will detect that and immediately terminate the post. Therefore keeping evil at bay.

As you can see, communication is an extremely vital tool for the success of further improving the academic system and social system, and this means that Policy 1 (Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) is the best choice for students academically and socially.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
