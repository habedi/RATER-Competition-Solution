Dear Head,

There are many kids who want to participate in community service and others who do not. I think that students should be required to attend a certain amount of community service in order to graduate. However the amount of hours the students are required to attend should be kept at a minimum.

Students should have to attend a certain amount of community service because it will teach them that it is important to help others. It is important to learn to help others because in the future it will help them mature, and become a better person.

Community service is also important because it will give students a chance to see what kinds of jobs they would and wouldn't like to do in the future. This way they would have a easier time choosing their careers.

The required amount of community service should be minimal because it will still give the students a chance to do what they want. Although it is important to help others it is also important to be independent. Students must be able to express themselves in order to be independent and that should not be taken away from them.

In conclusion, students should be required to attend a certain amount of community service, however it should be kept at a minimum. This is because it will help them mature as a person, give them an idea of what they would like to do in the future, and still give them a chance to do what they want.
