New devicies and technology is being created every day. One of those creations are driverless cars. Driverless cars are cars that can drive independenlty. Google cofounder Sergery Bin is envisioning future cars that are able to function without drivers. Famous in Movie and television, driveless cars seem like an interestining invention but the real question is whether they are truly safe or not.

"Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigation through roadwork or accidents." Technology seems to be progressing and getting better, but technology still has its technical difficulties. Currently we have cars such as Google's modified Toyota Prius, which use sensors. Sensored cars play a major role in inspiring the idea of creating driverless cars. Sensors go way back to the 1980's where automakers used sensors for speed at the wheels in the creation of 'antilock brakes'.

Although antilock brakes and driver assitance are improving they still have a long way to go until driverless cars are created. I believe with all the improvements and creations technology is coming up with we will soon be able to have inventions similar to driverless cars. Driverless cars will be responsible for the passangers in the car, and in my opinion I don't think I'd be able to trust a computer with my life.
