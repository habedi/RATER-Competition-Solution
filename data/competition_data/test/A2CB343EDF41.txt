Designing your own summer project can be beneficial. Theres an ongoing debate over if teachers should design summer projects or students. Those who disagree state teachers may give you more ideas and they can provide you with help for the design, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.

There are a variety of reasons students should design their own project. One reason is students can pick which design they want to do their project. They can decide on different ways to present their project. For example, students can choose to do a poster board, PowerPoint, or even a sheet of paper. Also students can take their time. Students will not have to feel rushed by their teacher. They can do their project when they want to and have time to do other fun activities during the summer. In addition, students can be more creative. Students can make their project as colorful as they want. They can provide their own ideas, design, and special features if they want.

There are more reasons why students should design their own project. For instance, there aren't as many rules or regulations to follow. Students can decide what they want to do. They can do anything they want to the project without any say from the teacher. Also, students would have to use more brain power. Since the teacher does not pick the design for them they have to do whats best for them. Students will not have their teacher always helping them and giving them answers. However, it can also be easier. Students will not have to abide by their teacher commands for the design. Its more beneficial for students by picking their own design.

Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer project. This is the case because it can be easier, students can be more creative, and its more fun. Those who disagree state that teachers knows whats better and students can know what to do , but this is not true. Students providing their own summer design project will impact the student more.
