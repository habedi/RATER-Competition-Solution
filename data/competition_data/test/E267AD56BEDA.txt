Dear Principal,

I have recently read the school's cell phone policy. I believe that policy number two is the best choice. Students shouldn't have cell phones in school at all because it can take their minds of their school work. For example, if someone sends a text to a student, it can distract that student and take their mind off their school work.

Students need to stay focused during school at all times. This is very important because students today need to be prepared for high school, college, and their future. Cell phones would distract students from striving for outstanding grades.

Today, you see the majority of students on their cell phones all day, usually texting. This habit can make students lack from doing their work in school. Students grades can easily drop and their only explanation for these poor grades is that they focused on their cell phones more than their education.

Being on cell phones all day can lead a student to a lot of stress. If a student does after school activities and sports, they still need to focus on school. Many students today are very busy with after school activities with their friends. Since the students do activities with their friends, they tend to text each other, and then that is all they are focused on. The students then don't care any more about their school work because they choose to focus on their cell phones.

I hope you understand my reasons why I believe that students shouldn't have phones on school at all. Students should really care about their education and focus in school . Education in the world really matters and is so important for students' future. Cell phones are not going to help a student have a successful future.

Sincerely,
