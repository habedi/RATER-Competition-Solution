It's a Saturday morning and the head of NASA has called in to have a meeting on discussing "The Face on Mars." When I entered the meeting room there was only seven people inside. I was hoping there would be more people than just seven, but the seven that are inside the room are very important in the NASA headquarters. I took my seat and waited for Dr. Turner( head of NASA) to speak first. How many people think this face on mars can be an alien?"asked Dr. Turner". Every person in the room have raised there hands,but I didn't. I stood up and said to everyone, "I think this face could've been formed by natural causes". Everyone was looking at me mysteriously and I still continued speaking. How many times have we seen any form of life on mars? NONE "I said." What possibly can make you guys think this is an alien for sure? We have national places where nature has formed a rock or some sort to look like a face and we don't questoin that because we know it was naturally formed by sand storms for example. If this face would've been an alien i would like to an explanation from all you guys since you think it's anlien. Dr. Turner was looking at me in shock, but at the same time was very impressed ion what I said. Dr. Thomas rose from his chair and started speaking so

I sat down and listened. We may not evrything there is in the universe because its so big. we probably only know 1/1000000, but we might know for sure we are not alone in this universe. The face on mars in maybe just a clue to tell us that we are not alone. We can never know what is out there until we have the right engineering to make better ships. No one from NASA has Actually step foot on mars because we don't have the right equipment. For now we have no clue what mught be on Mars, so what i'm saying is that the face on mars is just another mystery to be solved. "Said Dr. Thomas." Dr. Turner stood up and said he isn't sure what this face is made out of, but his choice was by predicting from natural causes. Everyone else in the room also stood up and agreed with Dr. Turner except Dr. Thomas. The meeting is dismissed. "said Dr. Turner."
