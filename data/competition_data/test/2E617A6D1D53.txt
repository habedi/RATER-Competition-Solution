Car usage accounts for the largest emission of greenhouse gases right behind power plants. it has put a chokehold on highly urbanized areas like New York City and London by creating smog that hangs in the air. This undesirable substance can cause many complications with health and can make the impressive cities we live in look like dystopian communities. A better world is a world with no smog or greenhouse gases and rather one with cleaner public transit.

One example of increased smog production was observable in Paris, France. After days of record pollution Paris enforced a temporary driving ban on cars with even numbered license plates and continued to swithc between odd and even in hopes of elminating the build up of anymore pollution. It eventually worked and the driving ban was ended. The reason for this sudden pollution was a series of warm days and cold nights that trapped the smog in the low city air.

Places such as Vauban, Germany are car free communities were owning a car is more of a hastle than a benefit. The construction of this town is more focused on being able to walk to your destination than have to rely on some other sort of transit. They have a main street which is the center of commute and is accesible by everyone in entire rectangularly shaped  square mile community. This town is an example of a trend occuring in many european countries and is being pushed by many organizations in the U.S.

Another way that pollution is being adressed by is called car free day. It is basically a day that car use is banned. It hit its third year of use in Bogota, Columbia and is very popular with columbians living there. It is a very easy and inexpensive way to combat pollution and is finding its way to many other areas.

In any case pollution is a serious problem that is being dealt with on many fronts and is hopefully not a problem in the later future.
