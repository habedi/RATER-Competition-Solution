Education is limitless with a variety of ways you can be taught, learning is endless, but distance learning can impact students in a negative way. Throughout some time schools have not changed in the sense that they still teach in classrooms, a more interactive and "up close and personal" idea of teaching.

Students complain about not having a takeaway from the environment they are put into. It could be the dynamics of the classroom that they cannot seem to pick up on or even the fact they do not like school itself.

Proposing the idea that a student can stay home and "learn" takes away the opportunity to make connections with others and develop any social skills and students are told often that having social skills is a key component to have and understand when you are in the real world. So why give the opportunity to have it taken away.

Yes, students should feel as comfortable as possible when in a learning environment, but should not feel as they need to isolate themselves in order to feel that way. Staying home is not as structured as being at school, parents probably will not be home or have the time to make sure you are getting your work done. School is structured in a way where students have a schedule they (occasionally) abide by everyday,

Having a structured environment is like supporting a students brain, it will help them learn and can help them succeed. Every student is different and their learning styles vary, this could work for some but could effect the way they learn for say, when they go to college.

Distance learning is not interactive and and not "up close and personal". Students have the decision on whether or not they want to do the video chat or confrence, it can be also be seen as a "get away" from reality after all it is behind a screen, taking into account that learning is endless, but not being in a classroom interacting with others will not benefit a student in a way they thing it will.
