Dear TEACHER_NAME, my piers and I have heard about what you are trying to do to our students, i highly disagree with you forcing us to do community service, i hope you take the time to read some of these suggestions.

Most students would consider community service a punishment, a very brutal punishment. You cant require students to do community service for no reason, although for a punishment for something a student has done wrong i highly agree, depending on the strength of the crime. Although your asking for all students to perform community service routinely, my main issue with your idea is that if you did make us do this, it would have to be outside of school hours, or cutting major time into our lunch/recess.

If possible, you could cut 5 minutes into each class, that would acquire 30 minutes for community service, depending on the schedule each group of students can do a different job, such as cleaning the cafeteria, hallways, courtyard and emptying the garbage/recycling bins. The concern is that you want us students to take time out of our day, when we did nothing wrong, as stated in the this paragraph you can take time out of classes, but its almost a guarantee that you wouldn't even 2nd guess that, and the students opinion.

I want you to think about how you would feel after a long day of school, 6 hours of straight learning with no breaks or free time, having to spend an hour along the highway cleaning up road kill and fast food rappers all across the ground, in the hot sun. Reading and teaching elementary school children shouldn't even be thought of, why would we drive all the way to their school in our free time to help 6th graders with their math when they can hire a tutor, or stay after class and get some extra help, sure if they are willing to come to us during school hours, otherwise i highly doubt that anyone will do your amazing plan of community service.

If a student is caught smoking illegal substances, or perhaps vandalizing, fighting, bullying/harassment, then sure, go for it, but your trying to force innocent well behaved students into doing your dirty work, cleaning up random trash across the hallways when its the custodians job. Depending on the crime entitled i think the punishment should vary, physical fighting, 2 hours of community service, smoking illegal substances, 5 hours of community service, vandalizing, 7 hours of community service, and bullying 1 hour of community service.

Why should you listen to a 14 year old telling you how to do your job? Maybe because he's speaking for the whole school, and all of us don't think its fair that you would just consider this without consulting any of us, taking a vote, or even trying to reason, i hope you get time to read this, and at least consider some changes in your plan.
