I think the state senator should change the electoral college to vote for the president of the united states. IÂ  think it would be a lot easier to do and make sure a president would be elected. They also wouldnt have to worry about it being a tie. And if it was a tie then they would be able to decide who the winner would be. Also the people will be able to vote for the president of the united states and won't have to worry about the electors voting for someone else that they didn't vote for. They also don't have to pay attention if the president were picked by a popular vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The electoral college method of selecting a president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The residents of the other reigons are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. This would a lot easier than the electoral college and would let people actually vote for the next presiddent of the united states of america.
