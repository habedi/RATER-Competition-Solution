Policy 1

I agree with policy 1 for certain reasons. I would consider my principal to agrre with police 1. I would like to be able to use phones during certain periods. Some periods I would like to use my phone at are homerooms, lunch, and other free times. I will also like to use them so I would not be bored. Also, so if were using them during school we would not get it taken away from are teachers. One reason why I would like to be able to use the phones in school is so I would not be bored. Yes, we would only be allowed to use them during are lunch period and other free times. But, with one condition, not use them during class time. But otherwise we could bring them to school. There are students in the building who use them during class time and I do that at times is either because we bored, We now what the teacher is talking about , and because is something interesting. Some other reason, is because we like to take pictures with are friends, or are selfs. This is why I agree with policy 1.
