Would a computer that can read you emotions be good for the class room? Facial Action Coding System allows technology to identify human emotions. Therefore it can tell weather someone is happy or sad. The machine can also tell if you are feeling mixed emotions by the muscle movement in your face.

"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang ptrdicts. 'then it could modify the lesson, like an efffective human instructor" (paragraph 6 "making mona lisa smile"). If the FACS systems was downloaded into the computers at school then students would learn better because the computer would know the best way to teach them based on there emotions. Second "'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. huang. 'so computers need to understand that, too."(paragraph 6 "making mona lisa smile"). Since people can't always tell the emotions of another person in the class room or if a teacher can't tell if there students are understanding the contect they are teaching then the FACS would fix this because they would be able to tell if the student understands or still doesnt undersatnd the content being tought to him or her.

FACS would be a good edition to the class room and to computers in the class room to help students learn and to help teachers teach to the best of there ability.
