I think that all students shouldn't have to perform community service. It takes up too much time of what we need to do. If all students have to perform and they have something to do at home they wouldn't have enough time to get what they need done. They might fall behind on school work because of all the stress or work that they have to finish. Students could feel overwhelmed with the responsibility they have. Maybe a student could finish what they have to do but they have no time for them self. If all students have to perform community service it would tire the student out over time and or put them in a state where they feel that they would fail if they don't perform the service. Now if the community service didn't pay a role on your grade then maybe it would be easier for the students maybe it even builds character but it still takes your time away. With school it takes 7 hours from your day then homework when you finish all that you got to do your part in community service. If your lucky you might have time for yourself. other student might think that having to perform community service could be boring or think that its useless because someone is going to end up doing something that put all their hard work to waste and then give up or stop because they think that its useless because someone is reversing their affect. An example of not being able to finish their work is when they have to do a major project for social studies and they don't do they fail that class and since they have to do community service they don't get to finish, or if they have a unit test on math and they have to study but they cant because they wasted time doing community service and then fail the test and then fail the class. When students fail a class they start getting lazy and don't do any work so they fall behind in school. So my opinion on this is that all students shouldn't have to perform community service they should only perform if they decide to and think they could handle all the work and not fall behind in school.
