From reading "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" it explains the doubts and curiosity that scientist have on discovering if Venus is similar to Earth and what can we discover about that fascinating planet. Even though scientist have had their fails they are still managing on finding a way to get a reason to find it safe for the first human to step on Venus. The author is claiming that Venus is worthed the attempt to study because it may be more similar to earth than we think and to help us get rid of this doubt we have if Venus can be a hospitilized place.

The author talks about the attempts that have failed from the fact that the spacecrafts have been destroyed once getting close to Venus. Even though they have a ship orbiting from a safe distance it is not enough to get the information they need since the temperature is too dense to get closer. So scientist have been looking for different sources that were used in th 1800s or 1900s that may gain them more excess to Venus but encountering the dramatic temperature can be complicating. Using our own resources like solar panels wouldnt work either since it is to an extreme distance apart. Although the temperature has been a major probelm since Venus is the hottest planet scientist are willing to take the challenge to get passed it.

The author states that scientist are amused by the idea that Venus may of had nature and life long ago, like we have today. It states that Venus has a rocky sediment surface that seem familiar to mountains, valleys, and craters. And even though Venus is closer to Earth and if a tragedy were to happen Venus would be "just around the corner" to start a new life. The exploration in Venus would help scientist grow their imagination and look for improvements for Venus and a new custome of life. Their thought comes that in any challenge you can find a benifit to all the hard work given.

The author thoughts in exploring Venus is for having more confidence in finding another fascinating place to explore in person one day and encounter new incredible expierences. And maybe one day finding a new stable living place like earth that can be improved. The curiosity given to find more of Venus has driven them to feel more motivated to explore and find new ways to get passed the difficutlies faced.
