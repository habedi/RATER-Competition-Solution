A study last year found that driving by young people have decreaseed over the years. Less people are getting there licensies and people are driving less miles everyday. Young people are starting to care less about cars. They are strating to use different types of transportation such as public transportation or even walking. There are advantages of limiting car usage like the reduction of green house gas emissions and smog and the less stress put on peoples lives.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe. This is a huge percent due top cars. If there were less cars then the emissions of greenhouse gases would go down which is a big advantage. In Europe they are trying to reduce the greenhouse gas emissons by reducing the use of cars. The emissons from an increasing number of private cars are choking the cities. With limiting the car usage the cities would not be as polluted. Like Eurpoe Paris bans driving due to the smog. This happened after days of near-record pollution. An another advantage of limiting car pollution is that congestion went down 60 precent making peoples lungs healthier. Cars also make cities such as China filled with intensifying smog. Cars are making the particulate matter go up by a huge percent. For limiting the use of cars and using other tranposrtation this will limit the use of smog. Without the use of cars was a great opportunity to lower air pollution which was President Obamas goals. Limiting the usage of cars will also help people deal with stress.

Cars cause alot of stress for people. Weather the car is broken down or you just got into an accident. They are very dangerous for people who dont follow the rules in them.
