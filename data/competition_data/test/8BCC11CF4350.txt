Dear principal,

From these two polices given i am agreeing more on having no cell phones at school at all. kids that bring there phones are most likely to lose or get there phone stolen. Then that is making all the school administrators take there time to look for there phone, but if they have not brought it to school in the first place then that wouldn't have been a problem.

Bringing a phone to school could never be a great idea because they would end being broken, stole, or they just make people focus less if they have them with it.

When some one brings a phone they'll end up playing games during the middle of class when the teacher isn't watching. Then the person sitting beside him might want to play and end up making him miss some important information from the teacher. When this happens the student would might end up failing a quiz or test all because of the distraction of the phone.

Most of the time i see some person playing or texting on there phone. Which i find really distracting, and there's noting i can do to stop them unless move to another spot. Phones could also hold answers to a quiz or a test. That person can easily take there phone out when the teacher isn't looking and cheat. That's one of the big problems with phones people cheating.

Some people might say phones are helpful in school because of all the little helpful tools that are built into the phone. For example some one who needs a calculator wouldn't need to worry on bring or borrowing some one else's when they have one on there phone. A couple student might require there phone for when they get home to call there parents and tell them there all right. Or if something goes wrong in school or at home they could easily call for help right away.

Now that iv listened some of the resons why phones shouldn't be alowed at school is all up to you know. i still personally think having phones at school shouldn't be alowed. Due to all the distraction
