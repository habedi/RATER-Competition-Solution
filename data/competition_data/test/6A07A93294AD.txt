Dear Principal,

Me and many of my friends, and other students are against this new policy because the grade level is to high for students who usually accept the lower average, and do well in their after school activities.

Another reason for you to change the new policy back is because it should only be if they are failing that you should not be able to play sports or do any after school activities.

Also if they are sports players who are good in school, but can only seem to get a C average it will seem unfair to them.

On the other hand not everyone can get at least a B average because not everyone will have the strength to work that hard just to do something they really like.

Also if what you are saying in the new policy is that students who usually get the B average, but they drop to a C they wouldn't be able to stay after to get help with their grades.

Plus I also think that you should give everyone a chance to do an after school activity to see if their grades go up or down, so then you can make your decision.

Many people would say that you are just doing this to torture the kids into getting better grades, and trying to make them change themselves mentally and physically. Lastly do you really want your sports teams to use math equations to see where a baseball will land, and while their doing that the coach will be yelling at them to run and catch the ball.

This is my reason for not having the new policy.

Sincerely,
