I think for some kids, learning from home would be a good thing because some kids are always distracted and messing around with there friends.

I think for a lot of kids doing your school online at home instead of being in school would be beneficial. Because lots of kidsÂ come to school to hangout with their friends and have no intentions of learning anything.

So for those kinds of kids online school would be a good option for them.

Online school would also be good for the kids dont go to class and just wonder around the halls, or just dont go to class in general. What is the point of them even coming to school? If they arent gonna go to class.

If a kid gets in trouble for skipping school all the time then what is the point to keep getting them in trouble? Just make them do online school at home since they want to come school. No one can force any body to do anything different people have different minds so the think differently.

So online school in my opinion is good for some people, That's the people that always are getting distracted, skipping school, and at school but never in class because he/she are always wondering around the halls.
