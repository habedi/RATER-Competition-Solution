I think this type of technology would benefit many learning and entertainment. For computers being able to understand emotional expressions this would be huge. The use of technology to read students' emotional expressions would help better learning.

For example, the text states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Typically when a student becomes bored they do not tend to pay attention, but with this technology it could help alter the lesson to make it more effective to learn for the student. Another example would be for entertainment purposes. In the text the author states,"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery." This shows making computer-animated faces more expressive could possibly make them more entertaining for people to enjoy.

In conclusion, I think this technology would be great for the world. It would help improve learning for students in the classroom and also improve entertainment.
