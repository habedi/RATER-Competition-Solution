Technology has advanced in many ways in which no one can explain. From Iphones, to computers, to microwaves; technology does it all. But, can it tell us how we really feel better than we can? I don't believe so simply because we grow through things, not go through them. We have to feel the pain and the drive to continue on to do better for ourselves. Also where would our privacy go? We should expect someone is going to ask us what's wrong if the technology shows that we are 95% mad. In paragraph 6 it states that, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," what if the teacher calls on the student and asks them what's wrong, is the student really going to tell the teacher? Most likely not so we have to put into consideration that people should get to keep how they feel private, it shouldn't be forced, and we shouldn't feel the need to tell anyone if we don't want to.

Emotions are what we use to stay motivated and driven. It may also tell us more about ourselves. What we choose to do about them is our business. One emotion that is a powerful one is love. Love is a beautiful thing and it keeps being beautiful because it is a secret passion for a person(s) we choose to share it with. If too many people find out about that love they might try to destroy it because it is not what they want. Then it stops becoming what we want.

If we get the technology that can tell us and everyone how we feel, we lose the passion and sincerity of truly caring about someone. We might just say,"Oh, I guess I got to go help them because their percentage on happiness is low," That is not sincere at all. We shouldn't be forced to care, it should just be in our nature to care. I also feel that people are going to be seen as a percentage now because in the pasage of paragraph 1, it said, "She's 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry." Why can't we all just accept that we are 100% human beings who have emotions and make mistakes. Not one single perosn is perfect and it's okay and completely normal for keeping them in and coping with them however we want.

I understand that it is good to tell people how you feel and what you are feeling, but it should be up to the person who is going through the pain to decide what they want to do. Give them time and they will be willing to spill their hearts. To me, all that the techology is doing is spilling our secrets, and hurting us even more. We don't want to feel like dissapointments and be charity cases so we don't spill our emotions. We also don't want to let someone know that they hurt us because then they might feel bad, and it just becomes a domino effect. I'm not saying to not tell people how you feel, but it should surely be up to you. Also, someone could completely lie about their feelings because maybe they've gotten good at doing it before. Maybe they've looked in the mirror and made sure to use the orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus to make it believable. We don't know what people are going thorugh and we also don't know how the person who has this information about us will act either.

Growing through experiances is one of the most beautiful things you can do because it shows that you have learned from it. That's what emotions are all about: growing. We don't stop the sun from growing seeds into beautiful, strong flowers, so we shouldn't stop humans from growing into beautiful, strong people. People who should have their privacy respected, people who shouldn't feel forced to be happy, and people who can choose how and who to talk to to handle one of life's many challenges. And happiness definitely shouldn't be based off of a percentage, but on our ability to become better and help eachother become better naturally. We all know what happens when we try to put things into our own hands and control things that shouldn't be controllled. Only love, being open- minded, acceptance, and sincerity can do that.
