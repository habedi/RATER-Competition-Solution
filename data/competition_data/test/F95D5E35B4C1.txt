The use of Facial Action Coding System could be a good thing to use in school. It also can be used for help better how teacher do things. At can also help a pyschologist find students with problems or mental issues. Another good use for it is could help the students in there ability to act in acting classes.

First reason why it could be a good thing for schools is that you can use the system to check if the students are bored or confused, so you can change how a teacher teaches in a different style. It also could change how the students learn. In the text I says this '' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' It would be good to use to help students learn what are some of facial expression and learning what muscle cause that movement.

Another reason why it would be good to use the system is to use in acting class. A lot of school have classes such as acting, drama, and threater. How this would benfit a student is it would help then try to get the facial expression that they would need for a certain part in acting or in play it also and help produce emotions. In paragraph 9 it says this '' according to the facial feedback theory emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotion but it aslo may even help produce them.'' Then it goes on to say ''constantin stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way to createing these emtions on stage''.

Finally another reason why it would be good to use the facial coding system is it would help the school psychologists if there is a student is having problems and they are hiding their problems . If would help alert the pyschologist if they are going threw depression or suicidal thoughts. it would help the pyschologist so they find a way to make them happy so they do good in school and keep track of what they are doing. In paragraph 5 it says this '' you van probably tell how a friend is felling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried etc.''

So with conclusion these are some the reason why it would be good to use Facial Action Coding System. It would be for schools to think about these option and what it can do for students. Thank you for your taking your time to read this.
