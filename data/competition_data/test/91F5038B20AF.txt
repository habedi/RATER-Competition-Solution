Dear Principal,

I find that policy one gives us a bigger chance to earn trust from our teachers, but i find policy two to be the better option.

If we were to bring our cell phones into school, only to be able to use them in free periods, why wouldn't we take the opportunity?

While a teacher wasn't looking, we could easily take out our phones and text behind our books.

Option two however bands phones from school completely.

That would be the better option.

It will tell students that if a phone is brought to school, it will be confiscated, and that gives us fair warning.

Option two gives us chances to get caught.

With this policy you are saying, "No phones allowed.

If your phone is in school, it will be taken away."

We won't be able to get away with having our phones in class, and it's harder to make an excuse when the phone is found, if they aren't allowed.

Option one however seems like you are saying, "We trust that you won't use the phones during class, or sneak a phone into study halls."

Option one gives us open ended chances to use our phone, and if its found in class, chances are we will make excuses of why we have it out.

Excuses like, "It was on, and I'm just turning it off."

or, "I'm just checking the time.

I can't read the clock."

As you can see, I think option two is better.

Option one gives us the chance to earn your trust, but how will we earn your trust if we are busy texting in class?

You asked for my honest opinion, and I'm giving it to you.

With option two, we won't be able to so easily get away with using our phones in class, and we might actually start to focus.

I do find option two better, but how to enforce the policy will be a challenge.

Most students will try and smuggle phones into school, and they will try and text in the bathrooms, the library, in the back of classes, and at lunch.

Enforcing a no-phone policy isn't as easy as it sounds.

Phones are a teenagers connection to friends and the social life.

It keeps us updated, but it also keeps us from studying, doing homework, and actually talking to people.

I'm not suggesting you put phone censors in the school, but I am suggesting you buckle down on this policy.

It could be saving us from our phones.

Think about it, they more we text, they less we pay attention in class.

But, the less we are able to text, the more we are paying attention in classes.
