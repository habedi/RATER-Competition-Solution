Imagine taking a test, and instead of diligently remembering the units material, all that's heard is the sound of maintenance and construction being performed in the classroom next door. This is unfortunately a reality for many students in today's schools. Schools used to be perfect for teaching and nurturing the next generation, however, not so much anymore. Traditional schools have undoubtedly lost their effectiveness. The future of schooling is online classes attended in the luxury of ones home. Although some may believe otherwise, reoccurring distractions, transportation issues, and an access to a bigger array of classes proves a distance style learning is beneficial to students and society alike.

Schooling has indefinitely changed in the past century, with both good and bad changes. Nonetheless, schools have always been full of distractions. 83% of high school students recall being disrupted by construction noises in the past week. Besides distracting noises such as this, other students can play a big role in it. A majority of scholars today realize the importance of schooling and how it can set you up for a lifetime of success. Other students have different viewpoints on school, where they see it as unnecessary and take it as a joke. This usually results with them messing around and distracting others. By allowing students to take classes in the comfort of their homes, they can tailor their environment specifically to them, and downsize the distractions. Some would argue that distractions are inevitable and people must learn to work with them, however, eliminating some distractions, will improve efficiency among students. Along with distractions is the issue of transportation.

Another flawed topic in the school systems today is the transportation. Some schools don't provide transportation to all students as location or medical issues can make this hard. If the school doesn't provide transportation, this then puts the stress of it on the students families. Some students live in very rural area's where school transportation isn't provided. By allowing students to take classes at home, this would completely eliminate the need for school provided transportation. Some students may also have difficulties with regular transportation for whatever reason, furthermore making online learning at home a great solution.

Lastly, allowing students to teleconference, or take classes at home would open up a larger array of classes available to the student. Many schools are bare in classes, and lack options to help students find their passion in life. By allowing the students to take classes online, they would be exposed to a whole new genre of classes and hopefully find something that would fit their needs. A larger variety of classes would allow the new generations to broaden their horizons. A common misconception with this is it wouldn't change the classes available to students but this is an incorrect idea. Online learning could connect schools around the world, giving them the opportunity to learn in a different environment

To reiterate, schools are in desperate need of modernization, and online schooling and video conferencing is the future. Although some may believe otherwise, uncontrollable distractions, problems with transportation, and access to more classes proves a different approach to learning, such as video conferencing and online classes is nothing but beneficial to society. These aspiring students are the next generation, so setting them up for life should always be the number one priority, and the most effective way is through online learning and video conferencing.
