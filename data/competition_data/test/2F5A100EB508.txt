Dear principal, there has been arguments about everyone in the school performing community service. I think that everyone should have a choice if they want to do community service. I think that community service should be for extra credit because other people don't want to do community service.

In my opinion i think that community service is needed because it really helps are community in many ways such as cleaning up the trash. It is important because it helps clean our environment. Also that the community doesn't need to hire workers to do it, so the community gets to say money. Another example is tutoring elementary children. This helps because some kids are in need of helps, and as I said teachers and parents don't need to pay for the tutor.

I think people who don't want to do community service think it's too much work. I don't think its a lot of work because you get to help out the community. Also I think that when people say community service, people think that its only just picking up trash, and they think its dirty, but community service isn't just picking up trash its about tutoring other children, and helping at the park.

In conclusion I think that everyone should do community service and help out the com
