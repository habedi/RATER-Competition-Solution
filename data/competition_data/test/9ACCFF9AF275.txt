Scientists found "The Face" when the NASA's spacecraft Viking 1 was taking pictures to find a landing spot for Viking 2. When the picture was first taken it resembled a human face. Scientists belived it was just another martian mesa because they were commin in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Scientist realsed the picture to the public trying to bring attetion to Mars. They didnt realize how much attention it was going to bring. I'm going to prove it is a natrual landfrom.

The cameras scientists used when the first image of the mesa was taken wasn't the best. In 1998 when NASA's Mars Global Surveyor took picutres of the face you can clearly see that it is a landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the one taken by Viking1. People were still skeptic because there were clouds the camera had to shoot through. They said the alien marking were his by the clouds.

On April 9. 2001 MGS got close enough to take more pictures. They took the pictures and used the absolute resolution to see any "alien markings" the picture shows a mesa.

A mesa is like a butte that are common in West America. There are landforms on earth just like the "alien face" that some people thought proved there was life on Mars. If there was life on Mars I belive NASA would know about it first. The face got a lot of media attention but in the end it is just another mar discovery in the line of many.
