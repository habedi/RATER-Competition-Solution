The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by stating facts about Venus and stating how humans are curious about studying Venus.

The author states why people are fascinated about studying Venus at first in the text.

The text states in paragraph 4 line 2-4 " Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-liike planet in our solar system."

This shows why astronomers want to study Venus in the first place.

Then, the author states interesting facts about Venus in paragraph 3 to show how dangerous but intriguing Venus is.

The text states in paragraph 3 in lines 2-3 "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."

The text also states in paragraph 3 in lines 3-6 " On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."

This shows how the author uses facts about Venus to show how interesting the planet is.

Finally, the author shows that NASA is having problems and is trying to find a way around Venus and its hostile atmosphere to uncover more knowledge about Venus.

The text states in paragraph 6 lines 1-5 "However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective," and in paragraph 6 lines 5-6 state "More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gaas, or anything else, from a distance.

The text also states in paragraph 6 lines 9-11 "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."

This shows how tough it is and how hard they are working to study Venus and uncover it's mysteries.

This shows how the author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by stating facts about Venus, stating how humans are curious about studying Venus and how well the author supported this idea.
