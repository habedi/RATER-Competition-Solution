Think that students should have a b average because that would influent's the student to do better in all of there classes and if they cant keep at least a b average then have them sit out games until they can get there grades back up to were there supposed to be like for example if i made a c average then i would sit out some games until a got at least a b average and if i cant reach my standards then i should be assigned a tutor to help me get a higher grade. and for students that want to keep playing sports should put there mind to there word and try to do better in classes. so i do agree because not one student is any better then others and if we have them sit out then they can work harder to get back to the game they love or the thing that keeps them active.

But for most students keeping a grade above a c average is hard because they don't set there mind to do things that can be done. and instead of sitting in the class room not getting something they should ask questions even if they think there to tough to do school but if you keep your grades up in the future you would get into a good college and be successful. but even if you don't make all straight a' s you can still be successful and get a good career if you set your mind to it and never give up when things get harder for you.

So for this statement i would agree a hundred present that no one is dumb they just think they are because they don't have straight a' s in all of there classes but they can still try to reach that level at there own past and never give up when things get hard just ask for help or go in for tutorials no one can judge you for being smart and passing they are held back because they wouldn't turn there work in on time and put in enough effort into there class work like you did and pass the class and someone will follow your foot steps but that is only if they want to secede at things like you did when you were at there school.

Most students would say that there to cool for things like this for this project to take hand it would change a lot of kids life if they really put there mind to it. our school should be about how cool you are or how loud you get in the hall way or how many times you get sent to a. p or the amount of times you get in trouble it should be about how far you can push yourself in class and you should work with kids that meet your standards and there learning ability and see if you can change that. with other students or tutors that can help you keep your grades up make sure you get the class work done and turned in on time before it beacomes
