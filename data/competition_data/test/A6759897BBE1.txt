Students have an increased chance of getting into to trouble if they aren't occupied by something good. For example, an extracurricular activity.

For example sports or clubs provided at the school. Extracurricular activities are not just for fun but for learning,experience and building the confidence of one another.

Experiences are a crucial part of life. That's what you use to build yourself in the future. For example when I was in kindergarten, we were playing with blocks . I had a blue red and purple castle. It was built so high , it almost reached the ceiling. When my teacher called for snack time, I got up and we all traveled to the cafeteria like a school of fish. While I was munching on my goldfish and sipping on my apple juice, Generic_Name had snuck back to the classroom and knocked down all the kids castles and went back to the cafeteria. When we got back to the classroom we were horrified. Everybodies blocks that were once formed into beautiful castles, were now sad little piles of colors. When the teacher had saw what happened she looked at Generic_Name and said " Where were you during lunch?" He burst into tears and explained why he did it. " I didn't mean to I was just so angry because my castle wouldn't stay up so II'm knocked ours down. I'm so sorry you guys ," Afterwards he got sent to the principals and didn't come back until tomorrow. From that experience, I learned that just because you can't make it doesn't mean you have to stop others, just ask for help.

In extracurricular activities you have the chance to learn from others. For example the first extracurricular activity I took was dance. I had a lot of fun in that class. I learned new techniques from the older kids and I now am able to pass those steps to the younger ones when I get older. On the first day however, I was nervous. I thought they wouldn't like me . I thought they'd judge me. To my surprise, when we did dances I was always shy because we are all here to do the same thing dance freely, so I quickly gained my confidence an started getting to work going "Full-out" which leads me to my next point.

People are always lowering other's self esteem because of how low theirs is. They think that if someone's is higher then theirs, they are going to be targeted. That's not always true . For example when I first started going to extracurricular activities, I didn't know anybody. I walked in the library with books in my hand and a nervous look on my face . I sat ow at a table alone when a girl and her friend walked over . They asked if they could sit there and I said sure. We got along quite well I made them laugh they made me laugh and we had a fun time so we got each others phone numbers and started talking all the time. Since then, I have met some amazing new friends that will always be there for me when need them .

I believe that it is most important for my principal to make it mandatory that every student participate in atleastÂ one extracurricular activity. The experience is amazing an your confidence and friendships will increase which can lead you to a great school year.
