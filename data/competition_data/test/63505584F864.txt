Mona Lisa

What is the difference between smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage - says Constantin Stanislavvsky. Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

We humans everyday perform or express the same impressive "calculation" such as any subject like math homework or science. Through all this the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. In paragraph 6 lines 6 and 7 this states that while the use of technology can read our emotional expressions "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. In the use of technology then it could modify the use of how people have their emotions and expressions.

Meanwhile, some computers can handle the use of emotions people have and their expressions depedning on how they calculate emotions. Not only can the computer detect the feelings it makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting. In paragraph 4 the first line the article says that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Huang, ''even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression" (like not smiling as broadly). However, everyone has emotions, feelings, and expressions, but some you can not verify or tell how they are feeling or whether they tell you they do not know what is their suggestion to it. Computers need to know that as well.

As in paragraph 2, everyone has emotions that just you can not verify or tell of how they are feeling or their confused and bored. In excluslive this software can be very valuable to many students in very many ways although, it is going to help them with observing many emtional faces and expressions. Not just the computers can help them observe the faces in paragraph 6 lines 8, 9, and 10 "The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Within this information if students feel sad, worried, and happy this all at once the software in the computer can still detect the emotions of this human or painting.

It takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it it takes less muscles just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling, when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7 line 8 "In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. It is all about the muscular action units.

In paragraph 9 lines 2, 3, and 4 it says "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. In this information, To an expert or computer system, faces do not lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smilimg" politician or celebrity is not being truthful. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!
