Driverless cars might sound awesome but at the same time they can be dangerous. I say they can be dangerous because even if the car has more nice details to it, there might still be a fail on the car. Driverless cars shouldn't exsist.

In the article it says that cars will be smarter, but the real question is will they really work well being smart? Driverless cars will be real expensive, also it will take a long time to create them. If driverless cars are to be used by everyone, it won't be good at all because not everyone can offord it, it might sound cool but it can also be dangerous. These cars won't be as smart as we want them to be. A driver will always be needed to conduct the car. The article aslo says that the laws to driving will change when these cars come to exsist. As much as we would like to not drive anymore and just let the car do all the work without our help, its not a great idea to have these cars around. We cant always trust on them, the roads won't be the sameas they are now. Driverless cars will make a huge change in driving and also, on the streets.

My overall opinion is to get these cars. Like I said at first they sound cool, but you can't always trust the car. As much as I would like to get it cause it sounds cool, I will not get as driverless car. I'd rather have an ugly looking car that i know I won't have much trouble on, than to get a smart car that I dont know if anything can go wrong. They can exsist but I say that they shouldn't make everyone get a driverless car, unless they want one.
