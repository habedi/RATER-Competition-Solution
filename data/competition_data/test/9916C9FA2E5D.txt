Imagine the World with driverless cars. Is creating driverless cars too expensive? How many mph will the driverless car be able to go? If technology fails and causes an accident, who will be responsable? The driver or the manufacture? Making driverless cars is not a good idea for the future.

Are driverless cars too expensive? Driverless cars would be too expensive to keep developing. Driverless cars would need a lot of technology for the roads and the car, and to create every piece of technology for each car would be expensive. In paragrah 3 the article stated "These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but the required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical." If driverless cars worked well on smart-roads, will they work the same way on regular roads?

If the car is driverless, how many miles mer hour will the car be able to go? The auther states in paragrah 7 "Ther car can handle driving functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." Will only going 25 mph slow up traffic? Slowing up traffic will interrupt the drivers daily life. The driver will have to begin leaving the house early so they will not get caught in traffic an so, they can make it on time, considering the car will only be going 25 miles mph. If the driver has to keep their hands on the wheel, is that really a driverless car?

Will making driverless cars change traffic laws? "Traffic laws are written with the assumtion that the only safer cars has a human driver in control at all times." If manufacturs create driverless, who is driving? The person behind the wheel or the car? If a persom gets into an accident no one will know who to blame, new laws will have to be created.

Making driverless cars are not a good idea because it is too expensive, cars can only go 25 mph, and if techonlogy was to fail and cause an acciednt, no one will know who to blame.
