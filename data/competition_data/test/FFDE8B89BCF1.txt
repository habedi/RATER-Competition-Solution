I think the use of technology to read emotions is very valuable for many reasons. One of the main points would have to be the fact that it could help to many people out and get help when students need it.

First of all using technology would help teachers know when a student is confused or is in need of help a teacher would know. Teachers would benefit from this a lot because they would know if they really need help or they are just bored. This would most likely improve scores in all subjects. My second reason why I think this is very valuable because it can tell a persons emotion and how they are feeling by just the way the muscles move or act. This can help people by knowing what they are feeling or what might be even make them feel the way they are feeling. The third reason would be it can also tell yout emotions when you're communicate with other people.

In conclusion this proves that the technology being used in this way is going to be very helpful and solve peoples problems all over the world.
