Statistics have shown that 82% of students, that do extracurricular activities, get better grades and perform better in school. Many schools offer extracurricular activities for their students. There are many different activities that schools offer, that various of students do. They can range from sports, clubs, and etc. Having extracurricular activities required for students is a good idea because it helps with focus, productivity, and learning.

Doing extracurricular activities can keep students focused on school work and on other things. Doing what you are passionate about, for example, music can help you stay focused. After a long day of school, it can be refreshing to just play your instrument or play a game of soccer. Some students might want to do extracurricular activities to be in a better environment, and doing can help. Something could be happening at home or just something that is bothering them, the activities can help take their mind off of it. There are also have clubs that help with homework, which can lower your stress and keep you focused. Getting your homework completed and getting helped by a teacher can help you feel stressed and unfocused at times, so having extracurricular activities can help with that issue.

Doing dances, sports, or maybe a club can be very productive for pupils. Say you have a new years resolution/goal and it's to play a sport or get active. Playing on your school's football team is a great start to a productive year. Homework clubs are also a good place to go, if you want to be productive. You'll be able to finish your homework and projects that you have, without procrastination involved. Staying at school, doing a club can be way more productive then staying home. When you stay home you are more likely to get lazy and get off task but at school you won't have the same resources, to get lazy, for example, a phone or a TV. Being productive is very important, and staying after school can have a big part in it.

Some people think that doing extracurricular activities waste your time and you learn less. However it's the complete opposite, you can learn so much and things you can't learn during school hours. If a student wanted to be a photographer, they could go to photography class. Many students stay after to learn something new and exciting. Schools that also offer clubs to help with homework and classwork can actually help them to learn more in that class. It can teach students topics, they didn't get before. And lastly, you can learn to play a sport. Sports are amazing to learn and once you get good at it, it is extremely fun. Learning new things are super important, without extracurricular activities it would be harder for students to learn topics like sports, dances, and etc.

Our principle has decided that each student at our school need to do at least one extracurricular activity. It will help the students in various of ways, for example, to focus, to be productive, and to learn new things, they may or may not have know. Some good activities that you can take part in is the sports team or the step team, there are lots of things offered after school, that everyone should do!
