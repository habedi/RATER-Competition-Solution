I WOULD CHOOSE POLICY 1 ALLOW STUDENTS TO BRING PHONES TO SCHOOOL AND USE THEM DURING LUMCH PERIODS AND OTHER FREE TIMES, ASW LONG AS THE PHONES ARE TURNED OFF DURRING CLASS. I CHOSE THIS POLICY BECUSE IF A STUDENT FORGOT SOMTHING AT HOME OR ISNT FEELING WELL OR NEEDS ANYTHING THEY COULD JUST CALL SOM EONE AT THIER HOUSE AND THEY COPULD BRING IT IN. AND NOW I KNOW ALOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THE STUDENTS WOULD USE THIER PHONES DURING CLASS ANYWAY BUT IF YOU HAVE A TEAHER OR TWO STANDING AT THE DOOOR WHEN THE STUDENTS COME BACK FROM LUNCH OR FREEE TIME THE TEACHER COULD WATCH ALL THE STUDENTS TURN OFF THEIR PHONES AND IF THEY COUGHT THEM WITH A PHONE ON IT COULD BE SENT TO THE OFFICE AND

PARENT WOULD HAVE TO COME AND POICK IT UP. AND THE TEACHERS ALSO COULD HAVE A 5 MINITE CHECK TIME TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS A PHONE ON AND IF THEY SEE ONE ON IT GOSE TO THE OFFICE. POLICY TWO EVERYONE STILL BRINGS THIER PHONES TO SCHOOL ANYWAYS AND STILL TEXT MESSAGES AND/OR CALL PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS SO IT WOULDNT MATTER. BUT IF YOU HAD A TEACHER CHECK TIME IT WOULDNT HAPPEN AND YOU CANT JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN START CHECKING IF KIDS HAVE THIER PHONES WITH THEM OR NOT AND WHAT IF THE STUDENT IS GOING SOMEWHERE AFTER SCHOOL AND NEEDS THEIR PHONE BUT THE TEACHER TAKES IT AND BRINGS IT TO THE OFFICE FOR A PARENT TO PICK IT UP WELL YOU HAAVE NO PHONE TO CALL MOM OR DAD TO COME AND PICK UP TH EPHONE OR TELL THEM YOU GOT TO YOUR FRIENDS HOUSE SAFLEY WHAT IF THEY CALLL YOUR PHONE AND NO ONE ANSWERS AND THEY NEVER GOT THE CALL SAYING YOU WHERE HOME AFE WITH YOUR FRIEND AND THEN THEY CALL THE POLICE THINKING THAT YOUR MISSSING BUT ALL THIS HAPPEND BECUSE SOME TEACHER TOOK AWAY YOUR PHONE THE YOU WERNT EVEN USEING.

THE END
