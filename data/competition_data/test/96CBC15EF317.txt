Dear Principal,

I don't think you should make students do community service in they don't want to. Doing community service should be their choice. What they want to do on their own time should be their decision. They al ready go to school 7hours a day, let them do what they want when they get home. I am sure that kids wouldn't do as much homework if they had to do community service. Kids are al ready so busy, they have a social life, most teens have jobs, they have tons of school work to complete and a lot of kids are on sports teams. Adding one more thing would make them stressed and they might not get as good of grades or they might neglect something they have to do like homework.

If you are thinking of making them do it on school time then that would be a waste of time. I know that helping the community is important and all and I would diffidently encourage it in schools but, forcing them to do it is wrong there are more important things to do than community service. Getting good grades is definitely one of them, that is pretty mush the most important thing in your life as a teenager. Getting good grades pretty much decides the rest of your life because if you don't get good grades then you will not get into a very good college and you will probably not end up with a job you like.

Adding on more thing to their lives' is going to probably get into the way of school work and sports or other activities. Sports are important to for a kid. Sports helps you stay healthy and it can relive some stress. Look at most Americans a lot of them are fat. If kids don't get exercise then they will be unhealthy and probably develop bad eating habits. This community service thing is most likely going to get in the way of their exercise and sports which will lead to them being unhealthy and fat. So please don't force kids to do community service.

Sincerely,
