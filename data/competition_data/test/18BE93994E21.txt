Imagine rolling out of bed, still in your pajamas to attend your high school class over the computer at your desk. This all sounds quite delightful, but is not all that you think it is. Home-schooling is a relatively new concept, which not very many kids have the resources to do. This was the beginning of a whole new way of learning for people in schools around America at all levels. Although some believe that home-schooling could be a revolutionary breakthrough for students, it puts almost all students at a disadvantage because of the lack of real world experiences adnmkills that they need.

Home Schooling is detrimental to kids social lives, because they do not interact with people on a regular basis and this shows in a lot of kids. For most kids who are in high school, there are sporting events, plays, meetings, and regular day to day shenanigans which better help to prepare students for what the real world is like. Students who take part in home school miss out on all of these opportunities and honestly lack preparation they need for the rest of their lives socially. The home school kids miss out on actual kid part and spending time with their peers at school, like the rest of everyone else their age is doing. Another home school issue, is that kids would never be able to take part in extracurriculars and sports. This is key for obtaining leadership and team player skills, which are very important for the rest of your life. These skills also play a huge role when applying to college and jobs. Both college and jobs take a look at everything you have done and grades arent the only thing that matter. The students who go to real school obtain who they really are and where they fit in. Home schooling doesnt have the competitive attitude and nature of normal schooling.

Furthermore, kids who do not take part in regular school have less in person experiences and skills. In school, I talk to around one hundred different people in six hours. Yes, this is a large number but shows how it really is at school. Things are always moving and changing, and learning in in person makes a huge difference. By attending home school, students lack the visual part of learning. This can make a huge difference with kids by giving them the hands on explanation to ideas that are foreign to them. One other thing that students in real school get, is good time management. By going to school kids are getting good at waking up at the same time and getting home at the same time. There is also sports, which in high school is everyday for some students. By taking part in all of these activities, students better develop how to manage thier time at places and plan their days out. This can be useful seeing most people who graduate have to get a job and eventually start a life, which will you will want to be prepared for.

Although, wearing pajamas and not having to leave your house is a cool concept, it can be detrimental to the life of the students who do take part in home school. Since home-schooling has become so popular, i have had about three friends take part in and only one still does it. It is hard to transition from one to the other because of how different they really are, and most people end up not enjoying it unless they do not know anything different. One of my closest friends Generic_Name told me that," Its fun until you get lazy." This means that most kids who take part in home shcool do very well for awhile and then eventually start not to care as much. Home school is really just a means to an end.
