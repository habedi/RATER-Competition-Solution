Students across the nation often spend their year day dreaming about the summer break, but when they are assigned summer assignments by their teachers, their dreams may feel crushed. Teachers are mostly the ones that create these assignments, but is that the best way to do it? If students were able to design their own summer assignments it might just take some of the weight off their shoulders while completing it. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it will motivate them to complete it, encourage them to be creative, and cater to the minds of the students.

If the students are the ones creating their project, they would be more motivated to complete it. When kids are having fun over the summer they do not usually stop and think about their school work, but if they were to design it, it may spark more interest for them. Students putting their own personal touch on to their assignment would make it less like work and more like fun. Teachers often assign large packets full of information, but by doing so, their students will procrastinate this long chore. Students are more likely to create an interactive and less detail packed assignment. Summer is a time for students to have a break from school, and when they get to make their projects themselves, it makes them not feel burdened about completing it.

When kids are given the task of designing themselves a summer project, they will most likely think more creatively than their teachers. Younger people are known to have a better creativity than their older counterparts. When students collaborate, their minds all put together should create a very interesting outcome. Their ideas would likely be more interactive than information driven. With more interactive projects, kids would also be creative while completing the project. Creativity increases effort which results in better grades. Teachers may think that their content filled assignments will benefit their students academics, but the truth is that kids need room for creativity in order to absorb information.

Perhaps the most important reason students should design their summer assignments is because it would cater to their own minds. The students are the ones that are completing these assignments, so they should know what is best for them. Students know what kinds of assignments weigh them down and which don't. They would create projects that a relevant to their lives. Teachers were all students at one point, but times change very quickly. What was once helpful to a teacher, may no longer be helpful for student in the present. A student-designed project would be made with their best interests in mind. Kids will design their projects to what fits best for them over the summer.

All in all, students should design their own summer assignments because they will be more likely to complete it, they would put more thought into it, and they know what is best for themselves. Teacher-designed projects may have quality information, but students are not often inclined to do heavy work loads over the summer. Since students are the ones that have to complete their projects, they should be the one that design it.Â
