Dear Principal,

When did a little work ever do any harm? I believe that it should be mandatory for students in our school to execute community service. It would be a great rule for our school to enforce, and I think you can agree. Students should have to do community service because it would help our community, make the students share the responsibilities of a citizen of this town, and maybe encourage them to help outside of what is required.

No matter how many people volunteer, a few more helping hands could always make it better. This town, along with most all towns in the United States, has plummeted with the economy. Which means there are more homeless, unemployed people in need of help, and more animals in our local SPCA. If we had more students doing community service, then some of these problems could be helped easily. We could volunteer to help at homeless shelters, do Meals-On-Wheels, and keep company to the elderly in nursing homes. Along with taking care of and playing with animals at the local shelters. And with so many people helping, a town fundraiser could be organized to help whichever organization is in the most need. However, this is only one reason community service should be mandatory.

Many students in our school skate by without ever having to do chores, or even try. They feel no sense of responsibility towards our town, even as its citizen. And if they were required to help those in need, it could give them a purpose to try more and have goals. I do not know many students who work to get money. Most have parents who provide for them without anything in return. When they see the real world and what is going on in the community, it could give them a moral obligation to help out all around. This could mean making them better students, better children, and better citizens as adults. Which leads to the third point.

Having students participate in local community service could encourage them to want to help more, maybe think bigger than locally. It could make them feel obligated to help out more around the community, at home, and at school. This would make the community a better place to live, and even increase moral among the students. With all the potential help from students to our town, a big difference could be made.

All these reasons and more should make the idea of enforcing community service on our students seem like a good idea. If we could make students partake in community service around the town it could make them want to help more, make students feel a responsibility towards the town as a citizen, and help out our community a prodigal amount. Besides, a couple hours of work never hurt anyone right?

Sincerely,

An Opinionated Student
