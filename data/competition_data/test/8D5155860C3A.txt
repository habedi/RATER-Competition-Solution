The "Face on Mars" was not created by aliens. It was a natural landform that appeared through mars grounds. Most people think that the face came from an alien which is not true at all. The reason people think that is because they believe there are aliens on the other planets. But, scientist did research and found out that is was a natural landform.

The face appeared on the monitors of Jet Propulsion Lab. They figured that it was another Martian mesa. I know that the Face of Mars didn't come from an alien because it was a humans face, they said. Aliens don't have human faces, so thats how it is a natural landform. Even a few scientist thought it came from an alien , thats when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia and snapped a few pictures to get a better look at it.

So, well thousands of sites waited for the picture to appear on JPL web site. It was revealed a natural landform, no alien monument after all. The Face of Mars was not easy to see because it wasn't really easy locating cydonia. The face shows either the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. But there are still people who thinks otherwise so......

In conclusion, The Face of Mars wasn't created by aliens, it was a natural landform. Scientist did their research and even took pictures of the face on Cydonia. There were no evidence of aliens or UFO around the face. As of now most people will follow the truth and most people will still think that the face came from and alien.
