I hear you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I know you are considering two possible policies:

Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all. I think that you should possibly consider policy 1. There are three reasons why I think you should consider policy 1. The students will not be disturbing anyone, they could communicate with their friends and they could communicate with their parents.

First, they would not be disturbing any one. Most of the time if they are in class, and their phones go off then it would disturb other students around them. If they are in lunch they would not disturb anyone. No one in lunch would be testing or studying. Even in a free period, students would not be disturb.

Second, they could communicate with their friends. If one friend is in lunch and another friend is in a free period, then they could text each other. They wouldn't bother anyone as I said before. They could just text among each other.

Lastly, they could communicate with their parents. If a student forgot a project at home, then in lunch they could just ask their parents to bring it to them.

Some teachers might not allow the students to use the school phone. Even if the parent want to inform their child of something. It would be easier to just text them or call them in lunch.

In conclusion, reconsidering policy one might be a good idea. They can communicate with friends, families, and they would not disturb anyone. I believe this policy is better. I hope you can understand my point of view. I also hope you could just at least reconsider.
