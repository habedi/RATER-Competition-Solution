Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I go to SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to you because I wanted to tell you about my idea about community service, if all students should perform community service or not. I do not think that all students should perform community service. I think that it should be up to the parents. Or an extra curriculum activity after school hours or even before school hours. You could even give it to the kids that miss behave in school.

I think that the parents should be in charge of there kid in what to do, such as community service. If the child wants to do community service then let the student do community service. If they think that there children needs or even wants to be in community service then they could do it. I don't think it would be far to the kids who need to spend more time on there study's or even children that already have after school sports.

An extra curriculum activity would be good also for the students. It may want more kids to go and do community service. I think that alot more kids would come to community service if it was an extra curriculum activity. Also if there parents new about it i think the parents would want there kids to be participating in community service. It would also be a good way for desaplan actions. For students.

Although not ever student is a good at paying attention to the teacher. why don't we give students community service instead of detention or worse. although it would be up the parents and the student in pick of witch he/she would rather do. community service would be the same amount of hours as detention just a shorter period of time.

I hope this will convince your mind into not having every student in the school do community service. Also maybe putting it to use like an extra curriculum. Or even letting kids have there pick in what to do between community service or detention. Thank you for reading this letter and please consider my ideas.

Thank you,
