Introduction:This essay is going to be about convincing readers that the Face is just a natural landform. It all started when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was on the planet and was snapping pictures,as it was snapping pictures it noticed a shadow of a humans face,in other words a big enormous head.

paragraph2:Mars is a planet anyone can travel too not just humans but martians and other strange creatures that we dont know about. Well it is just a natural landform because they got all of the evedience they needed to prove that it was no sign of an alien. Cydonia did everything they could to prove everyones suspicious but not everyone was satisfied they still thought that it was signs on mars that they saw a martian.

Paragraph3:In my opinion if i was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone i would kinda like go close to snap better pictures to prove innocents on my behalf to cover me and to prove everyones suspicious so it wouldnt have to be that big of an argument. They did a good thing by zooming the picture in three times bigger and all of the other objects in the picture,they saw clear so they had to see clearly that it wasn't an alien in the picture.
