Would you like to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? I hope you would all want to participate. It is a lot of fun. You also get to learn about different animals like what they eat.

A reason why you would want to have this is, you get to save animals lives and get to be with animals. The person didn't agree with me. He said "What if you are alergect to many kinds of animals?" I said you can wear a protected suit that animal's hairs couldn't get into the suit. He still doesn't agree. Then he says " What if you get sick or hurt?" I said we will help you.

Another reason would be, you could be able to see the rest of the world. You also get to see stuff in that country you go to, when you save the animals lives. He agrees and says"That would be cool but would you ever get to have fun on board?" I said yes but you have to make sure that you do your job every hour like feeding the animals.

After that many people joined the Seagoing Cowboys. Especially the people who were at the argument. One week later I went back on board and started saving animals lives again. It was a lot more fun with more people on board with me.
