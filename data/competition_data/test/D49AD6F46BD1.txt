To the principal

I think that you should not have to do something such as community service if you do not want to. I fill that community service is something you should do by choice, because that is helping the community. It is your choice if you want to help your city or not. I understand it is helpful, and it is great to do but some people just have things that they need to do for there self. There are many people that are not good people, and don't see the purpose to help other people, but that is there mistake not ours. Everyone should help but not because they are forced it should be, because in there heart they know it is helpful to do it. I have asked many people and they fill the same way i fill. I do not want anyone to be angry with me, because of my point of view, but remember this is how i fill not everyone. Me myself will always have it in my heart that it is only right to help people that are in a bind if possible, but that could be just how my mother raised me. Everyone may not agree with me but i be leave a lot of people will. I come to school to learn not to worry about if the principal is going to make me do extra outside community service work. I think all students should focus on our grades, because what we do now effects our future, so there for we have the choice to do extra things that are not the law to do. Why do i have to help the community if no one care about it? That is my most important question. I will most likely help either way, but i just want to know why everyone has to do something that is not the law. I know we have to follow the law and do what we have to do. Just like it is the law to go to school. So i will follow that law till the day i get out of high school. My classmates and i have already been in school for a long time and are half way done with it, and never had to worry about this problem before so we should not have to now. I have an goal i want to achieve and i can not do that with everyone arguing about this little rule, everyone has the right to do what they fill is right, and i fill that people can choose what they want to do. I mean all and all we are a free country, but it seams like we are not so free any more. with all these crazy things he schools are trying to make us do. I hope that the school board, and principal take this letter into consideration, because we deserve to be looked at as people who matter and if you made us do this it would make us fill used, and robbed for our time as young people.
