The author thinks that people should not stop what there doing because something is dangerous and has risks. The author thinks that venus should still be studied so we can find out why its like the way it is and see if anything is on the planet. The author wants people to keep studying despite the dangers and risks.

The author talks about how scientist are trying to make things that can make it to venus and say on the planet for a while and come back. They were thinking of making a giant blimp-like spacecraft that could fly 30 miles over venus and they couls study the planet from there. They could also make a simplified electronics that are made of silicon carbide. They are wrking on ays to continue studying venus.

I agree with the author, people should not stop studying it because of the dangers and the risks. They should continue to study it so they can find out if there is anything knw about the planet that we dont know. They could figure out what there is on the planet and why the conditions are so harsh.
