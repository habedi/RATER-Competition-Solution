I think you should join UNRRA, because this won't just be some boring fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games, it will be the most fun you've probably had in your whole entire life. So how about you come on down and try some of our activities. They will make you smile.

If you tell your friends or family about us, we will give you and those people a year of coming in when ever you feel like it, for FREE. If you were to come in and join in that is totally fine, but that is a little dangerous, especially for the little kids. The best thing about the buisness is that if you bring a kid in under 6 years old you get their cloths for FREE. Thats not all you can go to the snack bar and buy any snack for just $1. It's fun, fun for the kids, and we have delious food.

That is why i think you should come down to UNRRA. I think the kids are going to love it justa as much as I do. So why dont you come on down right now to have some fun.
