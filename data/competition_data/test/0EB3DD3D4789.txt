In the real world being an athlete when you were in middle school could help, so could being a part of the yearbook club, or even being a part of the student council. But a student's choice is special, because if they choose something that they really like they'll work twice as hard at that subject.

For example if a student chooses to do basketball at their school they may wish to bring their grades up so they can stay on the team. Or if a student chooses football, they will be in better physical shape and have to keep up their grades too stay on the team. And all athletes stay in shape through the season which feels good, so they will do anything too keep in shape so they will keep their grades up, sleep better, and be better in general while maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Or if a student does yearbook they will learn how to use a camera and what goes into making the yearbook. These students will also be able too make new friends, and they will have lots of fun. Like in sports these student must maintain good grades if they'd like to be in the yearbook club.

And if a student chooses to do the student council they will be able to run for President, Vice President, secretary, treasurer, and more. Like in sports and yearbook club, to be in the student council students will need good grades.

So if a student must do an extracurricular activity, they will have multiple activities to choose from. They will have Sports, yearbook club, the student council, and many more.
