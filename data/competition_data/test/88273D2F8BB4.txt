Many teachers disagree that summer projects should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. some teachers believe that assigning a summer project to there students but not making it student-designed is good for there students because it makes it harder for them and it'll make them learn something from it. sometimes a student will be assigned a project and if they do not finish it there teacher will make that students turn it in and work on it over summer break. another reason on why some teachers believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because a student may not be organized with there work. also, sometimes teachers don't want there students to work on a project in a group with there friends.

Even though some people believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed, students should be able to work on there projects over there summer break by having it be student-designed. imagine all the stress a student may have to go through if a project is too difficult and confusing for them, by making a project student-designed a student will have less stress and will most likely succeed with there project and get a good grade on it. another reason on why it should be student-designed is that they can work with there friends as a group and they can finish there summer project quicker, by doing this a student will have more time to enjoy and spend there summer break with there family and friends. lastly, students should just be able to actually like doing there projects and the only reason on why they would like it more is by having it be student-designed

Sometimes students don't like when a project is teacher-designed and will refuse to do there project, some students also struggle with reading and writing and when there project is student-designed they can go on different websites and search things up that'll make it easier for them. when a student has a teacher-designed project the teacher will most likely not want there students to go on different websites so they can get help and they'll want there students to try and think of everything on there own.

In conclusion, all summer projects should be student-designed so that students will feel less stressed and have more time to spend there summer break with there family and friends.
