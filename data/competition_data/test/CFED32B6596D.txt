FACS, or facial action coding system, is the use of computers to recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. The use of this technology would be very helpful in classrooms to read students' emotional expressions.

This technology would be extremly effective in classrooms.

Dr. Huang states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a studenrts is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor".

If a classroom computer was put in every class, it would make learning more fun.

Not only would it make classes more fun, but it would also be a more effective way of teaching.

If you start to doze off in class the computer would change the lesson to keep you interested.

The computer would keep students attention due to their facial expression like it is forcing you to learn by keeping your eyes glued to the screen.

This kind of technology will grow a brighter generation.

The use of FACS would be very helpful in all classes.

It would make a teachers job easier for them and more helpful for the students to learn.

The value of using of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions would be highly appretiated.
