Dear Principal;

I sent you this letter to tell you know my opinion on whether or not students should be required to perform community service. In my opinion, I think that students should be required to perform community service. It will be a good thing to let students know how to help their community to be a better place. First, this will let students be more responsible. Second, it will let students be neat, and organized. Third, it will let students be active and not lazy.

First, it will let students be more responsible because they know that they have to clean or do their job well. Then, it will let them be responsible for their actions. For example, if they are organized or not organized, because being organized and neat is a responsibility. That's also like a mini job for them, maybe we can give presents to them after they are done. We might take this on a trip one day. Also, we might take them to a restaurant all together to have fun. We can also do competitions.

Second, this will make students neat and organized, because if they are cleaning something this is like a practice for them to be organized and neat. If they are organizing something like papers in alphabetical order, this will help them be organized. If they're cleaning up something like for example cleaning the street, this will help them be neat. No matter what they do it is something that will help them one day in their life.

Then, it will make students active, because they work out. For example, they bend down when they're cleaning, they walk when they are cleaning. It's also kind of an exercise for them. It will let them be active, so they wont be lazy, and instead of being bored, here it is, something for them to do. That will help them at least with one thing through their life. So no matter what they do they will learn something.

Finally, i think that its a good thing for students to be required to perform community service. First, it will help students be more responsible. Second, it will help students be more neat and organized. Third, it will help students be more active and not lazy. No matter what they do even if they are organizing paper, it will help them be better in something one day. Thanks very much for wasting your time to read my letter and know my opinion. I hope this helped you to know whether or not students should be required to perform community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
