Dear principle.

I Think community service is great for our environment but some times it does take up time. For what is important like for example, doing homework or also doing projects at home. So i suggest that we can only do community service for the people that are willing to give up some of their time to all help our environment. So we can all help out our planet and do good in all of our classes and get our work done on time. Also be ready for school and make us feel successful and a great student so we may learn and help out the people that desperately need help in this world of ours we can all pitch in on helping with community service because helping the environment is great on a collage applications. So Mr. principle i think community service is an great idea but it may sometimes take up a big amount of our time so i suggest that we do not do community service for our school and we all have time to finish out work in our home and get a good grade in al of our classes so we may not go with community service because it will take up a great amount our time thank you.

sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
