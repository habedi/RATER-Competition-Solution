Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students including myself, should NOT be Required to perform Community Service for Three Different Reasons. One reason is because It takes Up time of our everyday life. For Example, Students Will be exhausted and won't have enough energy or time to complete their EVERYDAY Homework If Community Service was Instructed. Teachers, School Employee's, and Parents are always hard on Students about Not completing their Homework or Schoolwork and this here situation will just make that task even worse. Time is being simply taken away from the Students if Community Service was Required and Students won't have any room to do some of their everyday Needs/Wants.

Another Reason Community Service is Not required by students Is because, Its deals with Tutoring Elementary Students, and Cleaning the Community. Don't get me wrong their's Nothing wrong with help other friends/associates out, As a matter of fact that's a good example Of Team Work. All I'm saying Is Tutoring should be done by a Teacher, After all they do get paid for TEACHING. And community service as in cleaning up litter, should be Done by the Citizens of Miami Gardens, Or Prisoners. I've seen Prisoners being watched to clean up the City of Miami Gardens. If these Things were done by School Students their would be no jobs for Teachers or The City Workers which means No money to Supply for Themselves, Kid, and Bills. Its okay for Students to do this but I just Don't think it's a Suitable Idea for Community Service.

Lastly, Community Service should NOT be required for Students to do because, Community Service should be something else instead of Tutoring, or Picking Up Trash. It should be a Meeting, with all The Citizens of Miami Gardens getting together, and Talking about ways they Could Do things better. For Example, Things such as, Not Polluting, Teaching better or to the point when all the Students understand, Should be Discussed At This Meeting. If this was done I Do believe their would be No Point/Need for "Community Service".

P. s. Thanks For reading My Point Of View.

Sincerely, SCHOOL_NAME Wise Student, STUDENT_NAME.
