Recent software innovations have came up with a really valuable idea. Its for humans and computers to better communicate. Its called FACS( Facial Action Coding System) and it is very valuable. There are many ways for it to be important inside the everyday classroom by being able to change the way an online class is taught. It's read through a students facial movements and able to read human expressions. So when a student gets stuck or can't keep up the computer can recoginze that.

In the passage it states " a classroom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor." Not only is it reading the student to see how he/she is feeling but also change the way something is being taught so the student better understands and wants to pay attention and learn. It goes back to it being a valuable or important in the classroom.

Dr. Huang's FACS is a very valuable and well designed program and it should be used in ever classroom. There are more than a few ways it is needed in a everyday classroom. Students would well benefit from this because a teacher has to teach every kid and it is hard for them to have one on one time with all the students struggling. This would help give students a specially designed program that best suits there needs and abilities. thats why FACS is valuable in every classroom not just in the classrom but maybe even in certain work places or offices where they are needed.
