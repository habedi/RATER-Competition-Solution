Dear Principal,

I think that it would be a great idea to make students do community service. I think it would be a great way to get students involved in the community, let them learn about responsibility, and let them learn how much people, animals , and nature need our help. This would be a great way to get students excited to help and make this a better world for generations to come.

One reason why this would be a good idea is because it lets students get involved in the community. Students will know what is going on in our community and can help or even think of new ways and ideas to help with these certain problems. For example if some students didn't realize that we had a major problem in our community with litter in our parks, community service would help them realize it by making them go out and help with the clean up. This could then result in one student having a new way or idea for clean up. Maybe one student decides we should have a fine for litter or perhaps one student even starts a club that would go out every day and work on cleanup. Who knows, that student could turn into the head of the EPA.

Another good reason for this is that students learn responsibility. They will learn that is their moral duty to help protect the environment and to help the needy. For example if the children have to make sandwiches for the homeless. Let's say that each student has a specific part in making the sandwich. One child has to place the cheese, the other the ham, the second the mustard, and so on. Each child has that specific duty and if they don't do it right or don't do it at all then the sandwich will never be done or will turn out to not be a very good sandwich. So they learn that even the tiniest thing can make a big difference and if they don't do their jobs well in life then who knows what could happen. Maybe the sandwich of life will turn out pretty bad.

This also lets students know how much people, animals, and the environment need our help. Some students may not realize that hundreds of animals are put down in shelters because no one will take them home or that the shelter doesn't have enough people to take care of them. This way the students will realize by participating and will maybe volunteer in their free time instead of the school making them and maybe they will end up adopting a pet as well. Also most kids don't realize how many homeless people there are in their area. By going out and feeding, sheltering, and working with the homeless they will realize the true issue and will be able to help stop it. The same is true for the environment. If students realize how much people are doing to harm the environment then when they grow up they may become a scientist who helps to lower the impact of people.

These are just a few reasons why we should have community service. Because these students are our future. If they learn the troubles that are going on in the world now and the great affects they have then in the future they will be able to help lower or even stop these problems from happening. They will learn new ways to help or improve with these community service groups, they will learn responsibility, they will learn how much the world needs their help. The biggest thing that they could learn from this experience is how one person can make a difference. That is all this world needs, is one person or even just a couple people to make a difference. If we have just one person than they can push others to do the same, they can show their family how to do the same, they can show their children, and many generations to come. That is why I think our school should require students to do community service.
