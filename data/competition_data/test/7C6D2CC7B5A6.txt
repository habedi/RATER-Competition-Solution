Dear principle,

You should not change the policy to that because not many students would be able to participate in the sport we have here at this school. A lot of students play sports but most of them have C' s and D' s that would mean they school would lose money because of the change. The students that have below a B average would have to try harder but other wont try harder they will just give up until you change the rules. Many students come to school just to play spots and if you take that away from them many students will fail or even drop out of school.

What many students do during class is just sit in class and do nothing.

Also many students would try harder jus to have a B average and that would help them get there grades up so they can play sports. Many students would also have to do more work and stay after school and come in early. Teachers would like the rule because the students that don't try would have to try and there class would get more ahead of any other classes. In fact as more and more students try harder the school would get a better ratting. As the school get its a better ratting more students would come to the school.

More students need to get there grades up as study's show over half of the students will not get out of middle/high school. most students drop out or jus give up and cant finish what they started.
