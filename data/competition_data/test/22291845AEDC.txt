Imagine being able to attend classes in the comfort of your own home. In fact, many individuals believe in the the benefits of a student being able to attend classes from home. While it seems like a great idea for the students it's a downfall to their ability to learn and grow as an individual. Being able to attend classes from home would open the door for the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development of the individual.

One reason that attending classes from a place other than school is a bad idea is because it opens up the opportunity to be able to cheat. When at home who is there to be able to stop the student? Many individuals will find themselves intrigued with the idea of passing all their classes because they have all of the resources right there in front of them. When doing classes at home there is no way to monitor the way that students learn the information or if they are even learning it at all. The ability to cheat skyrockets as soon as the option of distance learning is introduced. Having the benefit of being at home gives students the time to come up with answers that they might not know. Every student will look for an easy A and having the opportunity to take the classes from home makes the possibilities endless for that so called "prefect grade".

In addition to cheating there is the aspect of distractions all around the individual. Many will say that their home is where they feel most comfortable. So in that case it goes to show that having the ability to learn at home, individuals will be faced with many challenging distractions. Being at home is like an invitation to a candy shop, so many options but what to choose? Will the individuals do their work or will they decide to mess with their siblings, play with their dogs, make food, call a friend, go out, or do their work? With school work being the students number one priority, there will come many challenging decisions, but if they didnt have the ability to attend the classes from home then the distractions would decrease tremendously. Students already tend to struggle in the classroom environment so adding in the possible comfort of their home is really asking them to do the impossible. They wont be able to focus on school work or have the access to the tools that will make them most successful.

Lastly, when attending classes at home an individuals social development can be slower. Having the ability to interact with others on a daily basis is very important to the growth of ones social abilities. When working from home students have the ability to isolate themselves from others which slows their development down. Going to school allows individuals to interact with teachers and peers which helps them to develop who they are as a person. If an individual just sits at home all day and isolates them selfÂ then they won't develop their own character because it's as if they are just living in a bubble. When at home by themselves the students also don't get the communication skills needed to succeed in social development.

While on the other hand, some will say that in the comfort of their own home they will do better and have a greater chance of success. They believe that they can focus more in an environment where they are most comfortable. Individuals feel as if there is less pressure on them because they dont always have that figure standing over them as they would if they were in the classroom. While in reality ones home is too comfortable and you need the constant nagging to be able to get done what needs to get done.

So in conclusion being at school and involved with the contact of everyday people is the best choice for an individual to succeed. Attending classes from home would only open up the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development. So now the questions yours, does it benefit the student to work from home with many downfalls?
