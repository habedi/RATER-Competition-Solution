Dear Mr. Principal,

I think that you should not require all students to participate in community service because that isn't fair to the children. It's already bad enough we have to go to school for 7 hours! Also, if children want to perform in doing community service, I think you should give them high school credits because they are doing something for the community and they deserve it for volunteering! Many kids have to do other things after school and community service is definitely not one of them. As a student, I don't agree with your suggestion and I strongly suggest you not pass that as a rule to all children because students have to do other things. For example: homework, hang out with friends, spend time with the family, etc. I know i have a busy life and I would absolutely HATE the idea of you even thinking about changing that to something a child has to do. We deserve to have the right to choose if we would like to participate in helping our community. For example, you should have us, students, vote on if we would like that or not and the people who did vote yes then they should be getting something (like a high school credit ) for there volunteering and helping our world become a better place. But for the children who don't agree, they shouldn't be forced to be performing in community service. As the principal you are, you should do the honor of letting the kids choose this time. Yes, helping the community is important but that shouldn't get in the way of the students time in there day.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
