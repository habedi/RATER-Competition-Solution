Did you know that many schools offer a other way of learning that doesn't require you to go to school? Many schools across the world offer online schooling ,but the question is do you think student benefit from being able to attend school that home? I would agree that it is very beneficial that student have the option to do school at their home because they are still learning, it may not be their choice,and some student might feel that it is better if they do their school work that home.

Firstly, I would argue that it simply might not be their choice at all,many students might have to pick up one or maybe even two jobs just to help their parents pay the bills and help put food on the table. So them having another way of learning that does require them to go to school will help them out a lot. Some kids parents are in the military so that getting up and moving school to school could be very hard for them to adjust to so online classes would be benefiting not only the kids so that they dont have to keep on having to losing bond with new friend every time their parents get station in a new state or city but it would also help the parent not have to worry about their kids in school. Not all kids in this world have the option to go to school they may have to pick multiple jobs or never just stay in one school like the rest of us so them still getting to learn like the rest of us is very important.

Secondly,Many student deal with bullies or people harassing them on a day to day because they might be different or dress a type of way at school so they student who have to deal with these problems might feel that they don't want to go to school anymore so online class or video conferencing with their teacher so that they can get the work and notes will benefit them and the won't have to deal with those type of issues while not having to having to with those long lasting affect for being bullied. Some student might just feel like they can work better and learn more while being at home and taking online classes, if students are still learning and get the information that they are supposed to be getting then that should be what is really important. If they are can get all the work and still learn and get all the information that the kids that are in school are getting the it is beneficial. They are still learning but doing it a different way.

To conclude, anyway of obtaining knowledge should be beneficial no matter if you are at home or at school as long as you are learning then their should be nothing wrong with that. Now looking that it from another side of the argument i can see why you could say that the experience and that the bonds you will make at school you can get anywhere else. While that is true that is not why school was built, it was built for you to learn and all that stuff are just peaks of going to school but your main focus should be on learning and if you have to be at home to learn and get you be chance to succeed then that should be what is beneficial. Now i ask you to look and she if your local schools what online classes and if they don't write a letter to their school board or principle and push them to try and make so you never know you can really be helping someone out
