Some people think that aliens created the Face on Mars. Do you belive that to? I think that The Face on Mars is a natural landform here is why. " The caption wrote huge rock formation" which would most likely mean a natural landform from what N.A.S.A. stated when they unveiled the photo of the rock formation. Also has not found any evidence of life on Mars to this day.

N.A.S.A. had also said "That if there were objects in this picture like airplanes, on the ground or Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were." Also in the pictures that are in the article ther are no signs of any homes or camps or signs of life.

This also proves the theory that it is a landform "what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West which would mean that this is somthing similar to what we have seen on earth before. The Jet Propulsion Lab said " Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa.

Also if this was something created by aliens or an ancient civilization wouldn't it be deteroryating over time. From the rearch that NASA has done it seems that it has not changed at all over the past 25 years. So do you belive that aliens created The Face on Mars? I don't but mabye you do.
