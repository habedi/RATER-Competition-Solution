Dear Principal,

Sometimes I do believe that we all should do community service, other times not so much. Personally I don't think it should be a requirement. The task might get in the way of our life that we want to live. Some people have time to spare, some have such a tight schedule they can barley squeeze in time with their friends.

If you want community service to be a requirement for the school, you should think it over, maybe it could be a punishment for people who don't behave in class or school. If not a punishment, just a requirement, then you would have to think of the students schedules. Maybe they have sports after school, maybe a funeral, maybe they are going on vacation to see a grandparent or relative in another state, and so on.

If students take part in after school activities then that is their choice, but as a principal you should think of the students schedule a lot more. Playing sports, I know I do and I definitely know that sports get in the way of homework already going to practice at three maybe four o' clock not getting home at seven or eight o' clock sometimes. Then you would get home, sit down and start doing homework, usually getting done about an hour later minimum. Then you remember it, you have to go do community service this week. Playing sports gets in the way of a lot of things. Getting packed with homework every day and then projects and maybe one sport at a time, two at max. Doing community service would be hard.

Now when you go visit a relative far away, sure you can still do that community service that you teacher assigned, but you won't want to, you would want to spend as much time with that family member as possible before you leave to go home again. Maybe you will bring homework with you on the trip but you would only do it during the ride there and back, late at night when everyone is resting or sleeping, and then it would be to late to go do community service.

Now just imagine this, visiting a relative you haven't seen in a while, maybe when you were a kid or just one you haven't seen in a while, you wouldn't want to spend it doing community service would you?
