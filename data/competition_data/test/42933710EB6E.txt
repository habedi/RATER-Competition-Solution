Dear Principal,

I believe that you should require community service for high school credits. It is a good opportunity for students to learn to help others rather than only care for themselves. I think that it will be a unique experience and people would feel rather happy with what they have done.

Many of my friends believe that doing community service is a waste of time and that they need time for what they want to do, but in my opinion, that is selfish and wrong. Community service gives you a pat on the back and you feel important to someone, something or someplace.

There are many accessible ways to do community service. Tutoring is one way. Tutoring someone could lead them to their future, and leading the path to someone's future is something that they will never forget and always thank you for. Another way to help out your community is to pick up trash from places like the beach, the park and around where you live. Picking up litter from these places will keep animals out of the danger-zone and little kids safe.

A super easy way to help out is donating old clothes to the Salvation Army. You're not going to wear them anymore, so might as well let someone! You could also bake something sweet for homeless shelters. All of these ways are in reach and you would be making someone feel very special.

You could hold a book drive for an orphanage. You could turn in your old books or your childhood favorites and maybe they would be someone else's favorite. You could give old clothes, books and other things as presents for orphans for Christmas every year. Just one day every year would make someone feel special for life!

And that is why I think you should require community service. Students should know that if they were in certain situations and they could not do anything about it, someone like them might have been there to help. A sense of accomplishment comes with community service. The biggest compliment there is is to have someone say "Thank you" with a smile.

I hope you take my advice and require community service to students.

Thank you, and Sincerely,

Student
