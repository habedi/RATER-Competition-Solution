Dear Principal,

I'm writing this letter to inform you that Cell phone at lunch should be okay and all of the free times that we have. While school is going on. Texting in class will keep the children's and teen's from learning on what the teachers are trying to teach them. And if i was the teacher i would have done made the rule of teacher letting the students text friend's during school as in lunch, or free times between classes. when there in the hall's. For the thought that if your in class then your not lurning much of anything but putting text messages in your head. On the other side of why it's not a good ideal of student's having phones in school is because most people are nothing but drama. As in they will start conflicts and always' need to go and see you.

Most students that have cell phones all they are doing on them is starting drama because when one person gets a text message then theirs going to be another student getting the drama shown on there phone so for and so on. Cell phone's travel as in the text message one person and can tell you something very sad and you don't want anyone else knowing but your friend. Then if you and your friend get into a fight then there's going to be Drama with in you and your old friend you all will get into a big fight. All texting in ways is drama because people are childish in all kinds of ways harassment, bulling.

Then theirs way's that I can see why teacher and you don't want the students to have there cell phones out any place at school is because of the internet students get on facebook, or anything that can get people starting in with drama. The facebook can lead to harassment, and bulling just as the text messages can. In lots of way's I do see where the teachers are getting at that cell phones are not safe for the school regulation. Because students can and will get hurt if the drama on cell phones is stated then the kids and teen's parents might contact the school and yell and most teachers around don't want that happening.

That's why cell phone should not be in classes but during lunch and free space of time yes they should be allowed.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
