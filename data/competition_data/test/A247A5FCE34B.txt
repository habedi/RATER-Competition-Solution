dear principal:

i have noticed how you have changed the school policy. i respectively disagree with that. i understand that you expect good effort in class, but i just can not agree with your rule. a lot of great athletes have a c average, but if you wouldn't let them play, our teams wouldn't be as good until they got the grades up.

people should have the right to do what they want even if they have a c average. in my opinion, a c average is still passing and it is better than a d average. i think as long as they are passing they should be able to do what they want. if kids cant be in football and volleyball and etcetera then school classes would be more kayo tic. some of the athletes in our school are very active, but have a c average. if the school board didn't let them play, class disruptions would be at an all time high.

i am strongly against this new policy of the school. i would like the class disruptions to stay at a minimum. some athletes can be really distracting when they don't have the motivation keep them quiet. i, as a concerned student of the school would kindly ask not to enforce this school policy. to me only bad things can come from this. i strongly urge you to reconsider this new policy.

i would like to thank you for reading this letter. i hope that you would take this complaint into consideration. i also hope that we can work out a solution to this conflict.
