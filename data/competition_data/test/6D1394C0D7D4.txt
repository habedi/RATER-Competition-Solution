Students should participate in extracurricular activities at school so they have a better understanding on how they can work on themselves. I think we should participate in more activities at school because it will help students practice classes they're struggling with at school, they can learn how to work appropriately with others, and it will make them more productive people in the future. Having an opportunity for more activities can encourage kids to try harder at school and become better people instead of being in your house trying to figure out what to do today.

To begin, working with teachers can give students more options to get more help or give others help if they are having rough times in school. They can go to teachers to ask what they are doing wrong and fix their mistakes they are making during class. Kids can also do extra credit work to raise their grade or just get a better understanding of what they are working on in class. They can also try out for more advanced work after school if they don't feel as challenged as they should to help them for better futures. Getting more help from teachers can make students smarter and feel less stressed once they actually realize what their teacher is writing on the whiteboard.

Next, doing sports or clubs can teach students how to get along better working with others. It will help students make more friends so they don't feel left out or alone on a team when they are with more people because they might feel awkward. More kids will feel more comfortable acting like themselves in larger groups once they get to know everybody the proper way. It will also teach the kids teamwork and how to communicate with others and let them know how you feel like if you need their help learning a skill you don't have but they do. Working nicely with others can really give a person a good reputation around others.

Lastly, having more options to do in school makes students more productive and energetic people. Most kids will like to play sports with their friends and excerise instead of playing video games at home. Doing clubs gives an opportunity for kids to express themselves and be with the people who have the same interest as them which will make them more friends. Also, doing something like fundraisers for their school will teach them how to become better citizens and help with our environment. This would give students more energy to work hard and play harder than when they were younger because now they are more exercised.

In conclusion, we should have extracurricular activities for the students to have better futures by working well with others, practicing work from school or other things they arent the best at, and become harder workers and become more productive. The students will also have a better understanding of maybe a career path they would like to follow when they are older. The kids will get more practice at school than at home where parents might not give them the help they need so they will have activities at school. The more kids do these activities the more they will encourage other kids to do more of these activities. I think that all students should be required to do these extracurricular activities at school in order to prepare themselves for a future.
