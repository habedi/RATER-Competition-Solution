Do the computers tell people emotions or what they think? why does the mona Lisa smile make people smile? There are three facts bout why the can not tell emotions or expressions.

The first piece of evidence is there are six different type of emotions and the software would not be able to figure them all out. The six types of emotiond are happyiness, sadiness, angry, disgust, fear and suprised(Dr. Paul Eckman). i believe that computers cant tell if the software can tell whether or not if people have the right or any emotion at all.

In the fourth paragraph Dr. Huang states that " the facial expressions for each emotion are universal," (Dr. Huang) "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions"( like not smiling broadly).I agree, each individual has their own exprssion that can happen anytime.

The Mona Lisa makes people smile because of how interesting the expression is on her face and how you dont know how she feels. Mona Lisa could be mad, happy, sad, scared, worried, any of these emotions can express how she feels in the painting.

The auther that wrote this artice is stating that software may or may not understand if you have emotions or any expressions. it can not tell because the software is not alive to tell if you are in a mood or not.
