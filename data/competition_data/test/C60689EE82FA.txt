Some people feel that extracurricular activities are not beneficial for children and teens.

I personally think that thet are very beneficial.

These are some reasons why and how they benefit.

You may not know this but 1 in every 3 kids are socially awkward.

Making kids join an after school activity that they enjoy with other kids that enjoy the same thing as them will help them bond with others and make friends.

This will also help with communication skills not only with adults but also with others.

If they dont make mistakes and ask questions about their mistakes than they will never learn.

Sports and extracurricular will also keep kids out of doing bad things.

Most sports are like a gateway of getting away from drugs and drinking underage.

Most sports teams have rules against posting pictures with red solo cups in them to keep the team and players safe.

Colleges look at everything from grades to community service hours.

Colleges also look for leaders at school and in the community.

If colleges see that someone has good grades and is a leader in not only their community but at school as well that will really be beneficial.

It is never too early to start applying and preparing for your future.

As we know our countries obesity rates are going up daily due to new technology like phones and how kids are on their phones way too much and they don't get nearly any exercise.

If kids dont learn how to put down the apple phones and pick up a real apple then before our eyes the country will jut get more and more oboes.

Extra sports will help kids to burn calories and fat in a fun and healthy way.

This is also a good source of exercise without having to go to the gym or having a gym membership.

As we know everyone has their own thoughts and opinions about certain issues and decisions and to conclude I would just like to say please take my essay into consideration when making this decision.

Thank you.
