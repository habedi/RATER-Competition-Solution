Distance Learning

Having the opportunity to get to do school in your bed at home would be amazing, wouldn't it? I have had multiple of my friends do online school and they said that their grades, compared to their grades from the previous years, sky rocketed.

They love that you can just say at home and you don't have to get ready. Students would benefit from distance learning because, some students learn better when they are more comfortable, in the comfort of their own home, you get to go at your own pace, and you don't have to worry about all the pressures that come with being at a public school.

My friend, Generic_Name, had the opportunity to be apart of distance learning and she absolutely loved it. She would always talk about how her favorite part was that she didn't even have to move or get up early. Getting to do school in my bed would be so much more relaxing. Sitting at a desk all day you really start to see how it affects your posture. If I did distance learning I wouldn't be as stressed because when I am in my room or in my house all the stress just kind of floats away and I am able to just sit back and calm down for a second. When I am in school my stress levels go up a ton.

At school I can get behind on certain things that I don't understand. If I were to do distance learning I would be able to go at my own pace and not have to worry about if I am holding anyone up. I have always struggled with remember things or not understanding things as soon as the information enters my brain, so if I had the opportunity to distance learning it would be perfect because I get to go at my own speed. Another one of my friends, Generic_Name, goes to public school one day and does distance learning on the other. She is constantly talking about how she does not have to worry about not understanding things because she gets to go at her own speed.

I am one of those people who is constantly worrying about what other people think about me, so if my grades aren't up to the standards of everyone else I get embarrassed so easily. I know that isn't some thing I should be embarrassed about or I shouldn't have to worry about but, thats what comes with going to a public school. Distance learning you do not have to worry about that at all. You don't have to worry about all the people who constantly talk about how an 87 is terrible and make you feel not so good about yourself. All you have to worry about with distance learning is yourself and thats all that matters.

Distance learning would be a great learning experience to really feel what its like to go at your own pace and not worry about other people. Online school or video conferencing would benefit students in a very positive way because people learn better when they are in the comfort of their own home, you don't have to worry about not understanding certain information, and you most certainly do not have to worry about the living up to the standards of your peers.
