If I were you I would participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a great opportunity of a lifetime. If you were to join this program you would make a difference for the countries that had ruins after being in or around World War II.

One reason I think humans, such as boys, should join this program is, because you could get a chance to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that had to be shipped overseas. Doing this could make a difference on these animals life. Think about if you were in this situation, wouldn't you want someone to participate to help you and take care of you.

Another reason I think you boys should join this program is, because it could be a chance to open up the world to you. In the ending of you joining this program will most likely make you proud and grateful for this opportunity you got. Wouldn't you like to be opened up to the world and know a lot about it? I know you would, because before I joined I did to.

My final reason I think all boys should join this program is, because it could open up many opportunities to yourself. I, Luke, made nine trips overseas the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. That was a great opportunity that I got. It made me feel proud and I know it would make you feel proud also. You only live once so hey why not, this opportunity could lead to many awesome opportunities.

In conclusion, I think boys that have the opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys program should do it. If you were in my place, you would want someone to do something good to now wouldn't you? So go sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. Wouldn't you want to help out things such as animals after a war? Well than that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program with no hesitations!
