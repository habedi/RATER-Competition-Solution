I disagree with this decision because some people might not want to participate in these extracurricular activities. Some people rather go home and do other things because they might not enjoy any of these activities and they rather do other things. Also I think that these activities will get you exhausted because you also got other stuff to worry about outside of school. Then you got the most important thing witch is school work. So in this SA i'm going to be giving you reasons why I disagree with this decision.

School work is a big deal, and a lot of people take it really serious so those people that take it really serious might think these activities will interfere with school work like studying all day or doing homework. Also some people got a certain schedule with school work like studying for a certain amount of time or doing homework for a certain amount of time, so I think these activities can interfere with peoples school schedule. Some people also hire tutors to help them after school so if those people with tutors had to do these activities they wouldnt be able to get the help they need and that can really affect them in school. Even for sports you got to practice to be good and if your to busy trying to practice you wont have that much time of school work.

So i think students should just focus on one thing which is school, and if your just focused on that one thing it would be better because you wouldnt have to worry about trying to practice and get school work done at the same time.

There are also people do are not into any of that kinda stuff, they rather just go home and do other stuff like play video games or go shopping. So if they had to do those activities they wouldnt have time to do what they want to do after school because of the activities. I also think that people should do what they want, like if they wanted to play video games after school or go shopping they should be able to do that instead of activities that they dont enjoy. Theres also no point of doing those activities either if you dont enjoy doing them, because then your just wasting your time when u could be doing stuff that u actually enjoy. Also people got stuff to do after school like chores, you wouldn't be able to do any of your chores because of the activities in the way. People also like hanging out with their friends after school and do stuff thats fun like play games outside or play video games together. Friends also like to hang out, and sometimes they cant hang out in school so they hang out when they get out of school. So I think these activities would interfere with peoples plans and friendships because if your doing these activities you really wouldnt have time to hang out with your friends.

I also think it is kinda bad for your health because some people get exhausted and stressed out because they got a lot going on like sports, responsibilities like chores, and school and its kinda gonna be hard for you to get all of that stuff done in one day. But if you do get it done then your most likely gonna be really exhausted, and with that type of schedule it might make you go to bed really late and thats not good for your health because you still got got to wake up for school early in the morning. Sometimes you might even have a big test the next day and you might end up failing it because you didnt have a lot of time to study because of your schedule. You also got sports to worry about, you have to practice on your own and practice with your team so you can get better. Sometimes you might even have to travel far for your games and that takes up a lot of your time. Even tho its schools activities i think the best time to do any type of activities is summer time because then nobody has to worry about school work or sports.

So I think the principal should find another time to do the activities, maybe the weekends or the summer because I dont think students should be forced to do these activities because some of them might not like the idea and not just that but people still got a lot of other stuff they got to worry about so I dont think thats the right time to do the activities. So those are all my reasons why I disagree with the principle.
