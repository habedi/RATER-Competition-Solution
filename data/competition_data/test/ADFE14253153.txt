Beep! Beep! Everyday people around the world drive to accomidate their busy schedule. With so many vechicles swarming the streets of the world there is bound to be conquences. Although it is impossible to understand how todays actions will affect the future. We can hypothesise that by reducing car usage we can preserve the world by lowering emissions and conserving rescources, create stronger communities, and keep cities beautiful.

Today nations around the world are working to create communties that offer an enjoyable life without the use of a car. For example in Vauban, Germany a suburban community has made car use generally forbidden. if fact poeple themselves are pushing for a way to avoid cars. In article one it was reported that "57 percent of Vauban's families sold a car to move to that community." One mom reposrts how she enjoys to be able to walkdown the streets listening to the sound of children playing(Article 1). In America teenagers are driving later because they don't feel the need to drive. In article four Elisabeth Rosenthal has found that her children would rather find summer jobs that they can acess without the use of car. In Bogota, Columbia the citizen have been enjoying the 118 miles of bicycle paths that have been in place since the mid-1990s. Today they continue to be enthratled with a carless city with the pop ups of new parts and sport centers. now citizens can take a stroll and visit resturants and upscale shopping districts all without the use of the car(Article 3). With the renewal of city centers the old life in suburbs has become less and less appealing.

Even more importantly reducuding drivers would help perserve the world. the idea is that by limiting the cars on the road emissions can be brought down. in responce to smog conditions Paris, France took the intitive to issue a partial driving ban. Article 2

Paris bans driving due to smog explains how Paris went about this feat "On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fibne. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." During that week congestion was down 60 percent. they took this drastic approach becuase they were nearing the amount of smog in one ofthe most polluted city in the world, Beijing, China. According to article 4 recently in america researchers have found that the rate of car ownership is dropping. "Many sociologists believe that is this pattern persists it wil have beneficila implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of america's emissions"(Article 4).

One thing is for certian the current trends is leading to less cars and the creation odf additional methods of transportation such as Ford and Mercedes who have already started to create a "broader product range beyond the personal vechicle"(Source 4). Although Bill Ford along with other car companies would suffer from the conversion he surprisingly has been pushing for a world without cars(Article 4). In fact at the mobile world Convention in 2012"Bill Ford laid outr a business plan for a world in which personal vechicle ownership is impractical or underirable. He proposed partening with telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bibycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation office are woven into a connected network to save time, connserve resources, lower emissionsand imporve safety(Article4).The world is certianly moving toward a world were car emissions are reduced, life is more enjoyable, and world city maintian their charm. By invovling yourself in this new type of world you are ensuring that future generations get to experience the same beuatiful world that exists today. There are big plans for this world join them.
