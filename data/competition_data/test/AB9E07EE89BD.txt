Think about it have you ever not been able to do extracurricular activities? See look I disagree that kids should have to do one because not all kids are able to stay after school and get a ride home. Parents can always be there for the kid due to work. Also some kids aren't mentally stable to do extracurricular activities.

Students wouldnt have enough time to do there homework. Some kids have way too much homework they have to do and they might not have all the time to finish it all. Kids would have to stay up until like 1-2 AM doing all there projects and homework. When its due the next day.

Students would get home late. Kids would have no time with there family due to the amount homework they have to do. They would have to eat dinner later then normal and wouldnt eat it with their family. Students would get no sleep due to amount of homework, the time they get home, and the time they eat dinner. Students would get home late and not have time to do anything they normally would be able to do.

Kids would be stressed out. They would be stressed due to the amount of home work, getting rides home, and by all the school work and chores they have to do. Being stressed out can impact their metal health and cause them to fail classes due to the amount of work. Some students dont have rides home and they could stay there for hours due to not being able to get picked up.

In conclusion I think that they shouldn't be required to do extracurricular activities due to the many reasons they cant get dropped off, picked up and stuff like that. Some kids would get home late. They might not have enough time to do homework. Plus they would be stressed out over everything.Â
