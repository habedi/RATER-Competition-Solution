Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I realize that you are considering changing the school policy so that student cannot participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average. And kids with C averages shouldn't be able to play sports or other curricular activities unless they get there grades up. I want to let you know that I fully agree with this thought. I do believe that grades should be the main priority, and other activities should fall in second. If you let C average students participate in unnecessary events, there grades would drop even more because there to focused on those activities and not enough on their school work. So all of those C average students would be future D or F average students. This wouldn't be a good look for our school.

There is also a bright side to this policy believe it or not. Some students actually enjoy and have a strong love for sports and extra activities. If C average students realized they could not be involved with these activities, they would want to do something about it. This would make strive harder to get there grades up. So your C average students would become B or even A average students. This would increase the passing rate of our school statics and make SCHOOL_NAME look very good. So Principal TEACHER_NAME when it comes down to the day where you have to make you decision, I hope you consider these thoughts. And look at all the disadvantages and advantages. But overall I hope you make the right decision for our school.

-Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
