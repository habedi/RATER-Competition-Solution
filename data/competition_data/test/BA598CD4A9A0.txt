Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to let you know that i think you should put everyone in school to do community service because then they can keep busy and stay out of trouble. They can also help keep the school clean and much more organize and have them treated like it there home. I would also like to put out that you can have most of the student working on keeping the school clean and others helping the elementary kids or doing tutoring. I recommend that you think about this and look on the bright side to see if doing will actually help some of these kids or even help the community or even the school. You never know if you can change these kids that say they don't have time for doing community service and let them become or do something better with there lives then just go to school and then go home to play some video games or hang with there friends instead of helping the community. So if you actually approve this i will be the first one to sign up for any kind of community service you plan on doing. Well i hope i have convince you enough to let this happen and i promise you that you won't regret it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
