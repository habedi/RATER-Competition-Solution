With students required to attend school up to 10 out of the 12 months of the year, a summer vacation is an extremely valuable time for students to relax and spend time with family. But along with rest and relaxation, it is a fact that most students end up forgetting a good amount of the knowledge they have learned in school. One way to prevent this is through summer assignments, which are widely used among schools across the nation to keep students' brains stimulated, even throughout break. But an issue that most students face with these summer assignments is that teachers assign huge, time-draining, assignments that often end up consuming their once-relaxing summer vacations. Schools should make use of student designed summer assignments, ensuring that students' brains are stimulated over their summer vacations, as well as still allowing students to have adequate rest and relaxation during their breaks.

Contrary to some people's opinions, students know their own learning capabilities better than teachers because of the large portion of students' time being spent self-studying. Students know the extent of work they can handle, and this translates into student designed summer assignments, which allow students to stay engaged over the summer in a way that is fit best for them. Summer assignments should not be taking over a students' summer vacation: a time usually spent relaxing from all the hard work put into the school year. Having student designed summer assignments allows students to assign themselves as much work that they think that they can handle over the summer.

It is common knowledge that each student learns differently. There are auditory learners, hands-on learners, visual learners, and combinations of all three. Having a teacher assigned summer assignment creates a strict border of a style of learning, leaving some students with more trouble than others. Student-designed summer assignments allow students to choose what type of assignment they have, allowing for maximum brain utilization and better results. For example, a hands on student may choose a science lab for their summer assignment whilst a visual learner could watch a scientific documentary for their summer assignment. Thus, ensuring that both students' brains are working at the best of their abilities.

Some may argue that teacher designed summer assignments ensure that a student is actively learning throughout the summer. But, student-designed summer assignments get the same job done, just in a more efficient and better-suited way. Student-desgined summer assignments are far superior to teacher-designed summer assignments because they allow for students to create an assignment that is not overwhelming and best fits their style of learning.Â
