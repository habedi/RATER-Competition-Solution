Have you ever thought that there are aliens in space?

Many people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. The Face on Mars was not created by aliens due to it's common landform shade.

Mars Global Surveyor was used to take pictures of Mars. The picture showed the Face was the equivalent to the size of a butte or mesa. Butte or mesas are common landforms around the American West. A famous one is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Martain mesas are very common around Cydonia. Cydonia is a region of Mars. It is not uncommon for a rock formation to resemble something like a face. The shadows on Cydonia gave the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth on the natural rock formation.

People who support that the Face was created by aliens believe that there is life on Mars and that NASA is hiding this information. This is not true. NASA wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Life on Mars would be great business for NASA and they would have no reason to hide it from the public.

The first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Eighteen years later, Mars Global Surveyor landed on the Red Planet. The technonlogy was way more advanced now. The NASA scientists were able to get a picture ten times sharper that the orginal Viking photo. This proved to the thousands of waiting web sufers that the Face was a natural landform.

The Face is a natural landform. Scientists at NASA have spent years finding evidence to prove that the Face is a natural landform. As of 2001, the Face was proven to be a natural landform and that there are no aliens on Mars.
