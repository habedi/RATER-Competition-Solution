I strongly recommend Policy 1 because students come to school to learn but the principle shouldn't take away students' basic rights. If students agree to turn them off during class then I don't see what the problem is. If students are not given the right to take their phones to school then that will surely cause commotion and controversy. If students bring their phones to school then they must understand to only use them on their leisure time. Clearly, allowing students to bring their phone to school because it will encourage students to be responsible to not use their phones in class, students may need to make an emergency phone call, and policy 1 would please everybody.

To begin with, the principle should allow students to bring their phones to school because it will encourage students to be responsible to not use their phones in class. This will also encourage students to have self control. For example, if students bring their phones then they will learn to not use it in class or suffer the consequences. Students will show self control by resisting the temptation to use their phones
