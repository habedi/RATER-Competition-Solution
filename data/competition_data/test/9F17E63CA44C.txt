Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that community service would be an excellent way of using time. It would be good for me to start with the classics and pick up the garbage off of the ground that nature has given us, basically because it is the only one I know about. It would be a wise choice of time to help the community, and Earth by picking the litter that some people carelessly throw on the ground. Spending time to help the Earth does not bother me a single bit, as long as it is not too wet outside. Many students that would be enthusiastic to give assistance would be glorious, but it is not fair for others to do it if they don't want to. I can understand if they want to stay at the comfort of their own home, and I don't really expect many people would do community service to use their "valuable" time. In my own opinion though, I think that students all over the world should do this at least thirty minutes a day or week, it's what you choose, but that is only me. I would not mind on how any of my friends would think about me, it is how they should feel about not helping the planet they live on, or even one of their friends. Also TEACHER_NAME, I think you should give the students that do community service some extra credit on their grades, which brings me back to what I said earlier, they should not do it if they do not want to, they just wont get the extra credit.

your student, STUDENT_NAME.
