Well first off Dr. Paul Eckman created a sytem called FACS, which creates affects and changes on human facial expressions for better results. This allows a new form of technology to change emotions and more. This software can identify emotions just like that!.

In my opinion I think that there is no need for this system to identify facials expressions on students. Because first we are young so you know when we are angry, happy, or sad because we tend to show it. Like body language older people and even people my age know when there is something wrong with one another, because you can tell how they usally are from how they are at that moment. Don't get me wrong i like what Dr. Paul came up with this type of science and technology, but i dont think it's neccessary to change pictures and add emotions to something.

I just think using this technology on these students wouldn't do much, but tell you whether or not there sad, angry, happy, confused, excited, and etc. However this technology shounldn't go to waste I mean you can use this technology in other ways like animlas, you can't really tell whether an animal is happy, sad,and etc.

But so far I like the whole idea just not the type of experiment Dr. Paul is trying to accomplish. His technology that he has created is outstanding , and im pretty shore he can find something else to use it for. So like I said you don't need a comeputer to read a humans face or body langauge.
