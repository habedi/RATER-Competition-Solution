67% of students show beneficial growth through participating in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities help yourself out. Here is how I think that extracurricular activities can benefit you. Extracurricular activities are very beneficial because student can learn new life skills, they can help out with their school, and they can gain physical health.

First of all, students can learn new skills that they can use in everyday life. Students can learn helpful communication skills by joining an activities that involve communication. For instance, If a student learns new communication skills then they can use them to get a job and become successful. It is not just communication it is learning how to act to someone. I promise if you learn these skills you will be benefited.

Secondly, you can help out your school by encouraging other people. By encouraging other people, not only will you help other people, but you will help yourself. As an example, if you serve on the student council you can help your school become a better place. Encouraging other people makes you feel good inside like you did something that made an impact.

lastly, students can gain physical health by participating on sports. Obesity is a problem in our country, but if we encourage children to get active. We can lower that number. Student could also find a sport that fits them, so they enjoy it. It can also make them stay with that sport for longer. Students also can find playing a sport can be really fun. If the children like the sport they will see the benefit it will bring them.

By learning new life skills, helping out with your school , and participating in physical activity you will see the benefit it brings you. If you do these things great, if you dont do them please do them, you will see benefit. Extracurricular activities are not just regular activities, they are activities you can learn from. Extracurricular activities are there so you try and learn new things, because if your not learning or trying we won't get anywhere.
