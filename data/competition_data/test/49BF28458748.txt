Even though it was 25 years ago does not mean it was created by aliens. After they found it few days later NSA said "It's a huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head..formed by shadows gving illusion of eyes ,nose,and mouth." If your not a sceincetist it sounds more realistic. Right? Next I'm going to tell more facts that it was not an alien that create the human face on mars.

When globa surveyor came in Sept. 1997 they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot of the face. Micheal Malin went to mars he took hs team and a camera that too ten times sharper than the orignal camera they took it with before. When they uploaded the picture all NSA found was landforms . Their is no such thing as aliens mountment. Some people were not impressed with this answer and cause it was located differntly in the winter time and alein maring might of been hidden by the haze. The MGS team even went out there again with a cloudless summer day and was 25 degrees in the center of the face and even used a different camera again and made it bigger and sharper. If there was any mountments or traces of aliens or space crafts you could obivously see it, but they did not find anything like that. NSA did find a lava dome that takes form of an isolated messa about the same height as the face on mars.

There is not any life on mars after all not even aliens. It as just a natural landform that freaked some people to thinking their are aliens. But you can not agrue with a sceintifc fact thats been proven over and over again with differnt season and diiferent angles. The answer they kept getting back was a naturel landform.
