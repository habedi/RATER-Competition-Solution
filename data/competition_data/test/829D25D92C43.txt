Everyone kowns that cars are dangerous. Think about how relaxing it would be to live life without the gases and the annoying sound of a motor that a car produce. This lead to the conclusion that automobiles are the linchpin of society.

their are millions ways cars hold us back in life,think about the enormous amount of car accident happening everyday and you can save yourself by getting rid of your car kown or just limit the amount of time you use it. Automobiles are responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas in the United states. People might say the idea of limiting automobiles usage is wrong because they need cars to go places but they because automobiles are causing people money for example in source 2 "almost 4,000 drivers were fined,accorrding to Reuters twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."

People should understand that cars are not the only means of transportation you can ride a bike in the cities to avoide being in the traffic  with the cars.

Citizens kown that if they do get a car get a plug-in or hybrid car. In source 4 sociologists  says  that the second largest source  Americas  emissions are transportation just behind power plants. Studies show that people who stopped car commuting find less reason to resume the habit.

So instead of using a car take a bus or a taxi. their are great advantages in limiting automobiles.
