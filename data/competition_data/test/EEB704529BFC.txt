How would you feel if you had to complete school work over the summer? Well, I believe you'd say the same as I would school work over the summer is beyond boring. What if you were able to complete your school work in a creative way? Some schools now require their students to complete summer projects to advance their learning. This is beneficial overall to help the students not forget material they learned that they will need the next upcoming school year. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so that students are still advancing their knowledge on subjects they've learned in school, also, so there is no debate over grades since all students would have the same topic and rubric, and lastly, because there's no question on if it relates to their school work.

Teacher-desgined projects have requirements needed to be meet in order to advance the students knowledge in topics specific to what they have learned in their class. While it recaps what you have already learned, this gives you an opportunity to go deeper and explore the topic more. For example, Generic_Name is in Psychology class, her teacher Mrs. Generic_Name provided a project to be completed over the summer about the frontal lobe of the brain. Generic_Name not only has already learned about the brain and the frontal lobe, but now she has a chance to research and understand the frontal lobe at a more advanced point of view. Teacher-designed projects have more of an advantage towards students learning so they learn about a topic in class, but also on their own.

Grades is an important part of every student's life. Teacher-designed projects allow for teachers to provide a rubric or guideline sheet on how they will grade the project so there are no questions for why you recieved a low grade on the assignment. Some teachers will leave feedback on their rubric sheets as to why you did bad, but you can't always rely on that so it's important that the student understands all the requirements and what the teacher is looking for. Teacher-designed projects give the student a chance to stick up for what the teacher told them because they have what they told them to do on paper or on a computer.

Risks related to school could be very rewarding or detramental to the student. Would you want to take the risk of having a teacher tell you your project isn't relevant to what your learning or have learned? With teacher-designed projects there is little to no risk on if the topic relates to your school work or not. Teachers give you a specific topic if it's a teacher-designed project. Overall, the risk of the topic not being relevant would be detramental to a students grades.

Student-designed projects allows a chance for the students to take advantage and call anything they do over the summer their project. Also, they have the risk of a debate over the way you grade the student because there are no guidelines or rubrics. Student-designed projects take many risks that could cause many different problems. Overall, teacher-desgined projects are the best route to take when it comes to summer projects.Â
