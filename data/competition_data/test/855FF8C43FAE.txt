Are students up for the challenge of making a yearbook? I think everybody should participate in designing a yearbook. Making a yearbook could help the teachers out a lot, it could take less time to make it if everybody helped, and it'll make a yearbook full of everybody's ideas.

Making a yearbook would help the teachers out a lot because i see teachers trying to take pictures of us to put in the yearbook and i think it would be fun if we did it! Teachers already go through enough in their day and they dont have a lot of time to just sit down and create a yearbook. I feel like we could take a stand and help out for once. The students and I need things to do, some kids have nothing to do. A group of us would take pictures around the school and the others would help create the yearbook after school. The teachers need a break from us and planning sometimes.

All of us working together will accomplish a lot. There are hundreds of us at this school and we are a smart group of people if we try hard. There are a lot of pages in a year book and it'll take days to finish but we got this! My grandma told me yesterday "hard work pays off." It's just like Field Hockey, its a group effort. We all need to work together as a team.

Every person in this school is different in their own way. If you take a very imaginary girls idea, or a very bold guys idea, and even just a chill persons idea; it'll all come together and make a beautiful yearbook! We could take our own pictures from our camera rolls at the school and put pictures in there, we would put paint in it to make it colorful, and we could take people's pictures for the yearbook. I'm a very creative person, i'm in art pause and designing things are fun to me! It could also get people to branch out and meet new people.

My mom said to me "you should help the school by doing something", i never thought about making a yearbook but it seems like it would be fun! We could be helping the teachers out, we would take less time as a group, and all of our ideas would be put into it. Its good for the teachers because they get a break and good for the students because they can interact with people. i would rather do something and help out then do nothing!
