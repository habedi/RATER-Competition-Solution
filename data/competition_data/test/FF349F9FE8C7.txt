do you think that car should be able to drive by their self? I don't think that cars should. Now I Know many people might disagree with me, but hear me out. I don't think that driverless should be develop because of reckless driving, car start to mafunction, and why would you need a driverless car if someone still have to drive the car.

there are many reckless driver out in the world today. when people are on the rode they think that they wouldn't have to look at the rode because their car is driverless. That car can stop working at any point of time, so why risk it. In a passage, I recently read, it say " the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times, so why make the risk of an accident go up.

Next why do you need a driverless car when you still have to driver the car. you are better off buying a cheeper car that works just as well. You wouldn't be able to take a quick nap if you wanted to. In the passage it say you would get bored waiting on your turn to drive the car. that can make accident happen.

I think that cars should not be driverless because of reckless driverss, stop working, and why drive a driverless car that someone still have to driving. It just not important to me as food and water is, so I'm saying no to driverless cars.
