Hello, reader! My name is Generic_Name. Some schools require student to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. many question if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that students should be the ones planning their own summer projects because it will be their summer vacation that they'll have in order to work on it. If the teachers are the ones designing the projects for their students, then teachers will most likely get the same thing from every student. Not only that, we as students may not enjoy doing it as much, because when it comes to doing big projects like these, we desire to put in our own creativity. For these next two paragraphs, I will be talking about these two reasons in greater detail before ending this prompt with my conclusion. They will be backed up mostly by my personal experience, but I will put in my own opinions and reasons. I will also be putting in lots of unique words that will this prompt more interesting. Now, let's begin.

I don't believe teachers should be the ones planning out the project not for the fact that what they would assign will be boring or bad, but because each student might end up doing the same thing for each individual prompt, even if each student does put theyre own unique sense of creativity into them. For example, last year when I was doing Driver's Ed, we entered the part of Health & First Aid. And when all was said and done, we were given a project to do. It had to be be done on a tri-fold and the information had to be a printed out PowerPoint. I'll be honest, I really wasn't a happy chum doing the project at first, although I did enjoy doing the PowerPoint part of the project mostly because I have a love for PowerPoints. When the day came for the projects to turned in and graded, we all showed our own tri-folds to the class. Here, I noticed that we all did similar things in each of our tri-folds. True, we were each given a different topic to work on and many us got a little creative, but in the end we were pretty much the same.

I understand that they do that to make certain we don't procrastinate or do minimum, but in order the project to have some form of uniqueness & full creativity, the student should have complete charge over the what & how of the project. an example of this happened last year in my Spanish II class, where we did a project that was about choosing three Latino recipes and write them out in Spanish. Our teacher, Sr. Generic_Name allowed us to make our project however we wanted, from being a cookbook, miniature tri-fold, PowerPoint, etc. But he also wanted to see our full potential, not just in art but in language as well, so using an online translator was generally unacceptable. And although he was fine with three simple but complete sheets of paper, there wouldn't be any bonus points for that. Fortunately, I paid attention in his class and my mother a Puerto Rican cookbook which she lend to me to use. Also, I don't mean to brag but I'm a great artist who it self-taught.

Overall, I believe that students should their own thing in the project while at the same time, the teachers should receive something of great quality. The two examples I just talked about are my personal experiences & reasons why I believe in the power of the student, although I greatly understand the teacher's viewpoint giving us the basic backbone. So, in a way, neither side is perfect or wrong. But of course, thats just my opinion.
