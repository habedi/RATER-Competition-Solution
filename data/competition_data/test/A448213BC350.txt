Dear, Principal

Student's should be able to bring there phone to school. Cell phones should be aloud on school grounds one reason to me why is because some kids walk to school and me i would feel safer if i had my phone just in case some thing were to happen. If students are aloud a phone in school just make sure there phones are off and in there pocket but you have to be care full we some times keep it in are pocket if you see are phones you should take it away with all respect because we shouldn't of had are phone out during class or walking in the hall way.

Certain kids need there phone like if there getting a ride or going to there friends house they can call there mom at the end of the day and tell her where he or she is going because some teachers don't let kid's go to the office to call because there learning or have been out to many times. If you don't allow cell phones kids will most likely still bring there phones to school.

Also if you band cell phones from schools the students will go home and tell there parents and the you will be getting all these phone calls asking why they can't bring there cell phones but as long as we cut down on texting in school you shouldn't band cell phone use in school some kids just don't like to listen so they bend the rules on purpose. Me im trying to pass and go through school so if you band cell phones you already know i wont be bringing mine to school anymore.

The last reason is that student's enjoy having there cell phones on them they like taking pictures with there friends and get each others number's and half the time student's need there cell phones to get to school and back home again. when students have there phone they should be aloud to have it when they go to lunch or free time but never in class or hall way.

There's good and bad things that come out of cell phones some kids use it for good reason but others use it to start rumors or threatening other student through a text message. The good about having a phone is you always know if some thing was to happen you would be able to contact help or your parent's. But if you band cell phones kids wont feel as safe if they walk to school because there phone or who ever they walk with is the only person that can help them the phone because you can call for help and your friend because they can help you fight the person off.
