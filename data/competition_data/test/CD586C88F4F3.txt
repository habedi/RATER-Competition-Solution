Is it a good ideal for student to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing? I think this act has an advantage and disadvantage because, it help students understand what they are learning, it waste time and it expensive to afford, students do a lot of research.

First, distance learning from home or by online or video conferencing help student to undrestand what they are learning. When student learn online or video conferencing, it helps the student get more knowledge about what they are learning and ask questions about what they dont understand. Example people normally feel shy especially teenagers to talk or ask question in public. This online or video conference will help the student to able to ask questions and understand what he or she is learning.

Again, distance learning from home or online or video conference waste time and it expensive to afford .A lot of students have jobs so they are unable to take class, such student will have to engage in distance learning through online or video conferencing to improve his or her grade. Example some students take care of themselves, so he or she has to work and pay the bills. However, video conference and online waste money because some of the students do not drive. They have to take Uber from home to class,which is expensive but the video conferencing and online is easy to afford.

Lastly,distance learning through online or video conferencing helps students to do a lot of research. This act helps students to do a lot of research and discover an information about what they dont know and what they want to know more. Example when the students are learning,they may come across a word or phrase or sentence that they may not be familiar with it. This gives them the opportunity to do a lot of research about it. Through that,the student is able to acquire knowledge and skills.

I will conclude by saying,distance learning from home to class and by online or video conferencing is good because, they save money and time, student is able to understand and do research about what they dont know. Any student who does not take part in distance learning should do so now, because it is important and beneficial for every student.
