Do you agree or disagree with the fact that our principle has decided that its a must to participate in extracurricular activities? I disagree because students should have a choice, some students do not have the time to participate in activities for certain reasons, and some students just don't like to be apart of extracurricular activities.

First, I disagree because students should have a choice if they want to be apart of after school activities. Students should not be forced to do be apart of any extracurricular activities. If they do not want to apart they do not have to because students can make decisions for their selves.

Next, I disagree because some students do not have the time to be apart of any after school activities. Some students do not have time to stay after school everyday. Some students have jobs. Some students might have things planned with friends and family. Students have more important things to do.

Finally, I disagree because some students just don't enjoy being apart of after school activities. Some students just want to go home, sleep, and watch TV. Some students hate after school activities because they have to stay back after school. Some students even hate the thought of having to stay back after school hours.

In conclusion, I think that all students should have a choice because some students cannot stay back after school for certain reasons, some students don't have the time to say back after school, and some students just don't want to stay back after school.
