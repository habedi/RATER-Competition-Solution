You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you can explore places see how other people live. The program lets you sightsee the Atlantic Ocean and you can see certain animals that live in the ocean. The program teaches you about hardwork.

I was working at a bank when my friend asked me if I wanted to join him in the Seagoing Cowboys program I accepted. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. I heard the program taught you about other countries what they had been through. Some countries helped out in World War two then Europe bomed them. I went to help pick up ruins of the citys left.

I crossed the Atlantic Ocean four times already I helped over 2000 people. I was glad to join the program because I got to meet people that I became friends with and they joined the program. I got more and more people joining the program soon we had 15000 people helping us. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean eight times already more than any other Seagoing Cowboy.

Some people didn't join I didn't pressure them to join I became friends with them,but sometimes they would ask me if they could join i always said ''there's always room for one more.'' I let other people join the program they became friends with everyone. I would sometimes have people that i didn't know join the program.

That's why I would join the program so you could make friends and have more people join the program. You could also beat my record of fourteen trips back and fourth. You could also see the animals in the Atlantic Ocean that's why you should join.
