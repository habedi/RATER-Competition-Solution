Some summer projects or rather any summer assignment can be really hard and can take a lot of your time but it's good for you because you won't forget the material you spent hours on trying to learn, beating the information to your brain. Many students try to find an easy way out of doing the work but thats not the right path to take. Students are supposed to be challenged and pushed to their full potential not simply given an easy way through because for the most part life will never be easy, which gives them the more reason to be challenged. Thats why summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed.

Although Summer Projects or assignments can be hard and take a lot of you time,it shouldn't be student-designed due to the fact that they don't want to do all the work. If a summer project were to be student-designed for the most part it would be a lot easier compared to what the teacher has to offer. For example, lets say there's two jobs, putting stamps on mail and the other having to cut someones front and back yard. Now for the putting stamps on mail job, you're inside a nice room with an air conditioning system, water, and there's also restrooms but you only get paid $50 for it. Now with the cutting front and back yard job, you're outside all day in the heat, restroom not always available to you and you have the responsibility of always cleaning out the lawn mower but you earn $100 from it all. In most cases people would most likely pick the the stamping job because it requires less work. Thats how it would be if summer projects were student-designed. Students would settle for less rather than pushing themselves for more.

The reason teacher-designed projects are better for students is because it gets them to start thinking out the box more. They start to get more comfortable and confident in their choices and in expanding their knowledge. They get pushed to their limits, they start to study more, and understand why it is they got something wrong. Also if a student ever seems to not understand its okay because at least they're trying their best to learn and they can always go to their teacher because a teacher always knows their students strength and weaknesses and whats best for them, they will try to find a way to help you understand it better. If it were to be a student-designed he could help you but not as much as he could've if it were teacher designed just due to the fact that he would have everything ready for anyone.

We should always learn to work harder and to gain more rather than to settle for less. Instead of trying to cheat on a homework, quiz, or even on a test, put in the time and dedication to studying and obtain the fact. Continue to study it as well dont just learn it in school but than one summer later you completely forget it, apply what you've learned in life and just keep the knowledge safe and locked in your brain. By obtaining the information and working harder and harder everyday, you'll make a brighter future for yourself and who knows maybe one day because you pushed yourself through every single one of those summer projects that was assigned to you, you will find a career that deals with the same material and you'll be ready to succeed.

Even though teacher-designed projects or assignment can be hard and take a lot of your time in break, its better for you as an individual. You'll know your stength and weaknesses. You'll know what you have to study and review more and what you already got locked down in your head. No matter how hard a project is one must always look on the brightside and carry on doing their best. Summer teacher-designed projects are meant to improve a students' skill, to see what they have learned throughout the course and year. It challenges them for the better. That is why summer teacher-designed projects and assisngments are better for students.
