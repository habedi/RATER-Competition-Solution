Dear, Principal

I think letting students use there phone at any free time is not good because that 's how something get started because some one might be messing with this person then when they get to use they phone at they free time they will start calling people to come up here to fight this person or that person and to just set things up. Then another thing why i think its not a good idea because a lot of people phones get stolen then you'll have a lot of parents coming and stuff like that. I also think not allowing phones in school period is the best idea for the school safety and the students safety because would anybody have to worry a bout there phone getting taken and the teacher won't have to worry a bout someone phone going off while she's teaching and whose texting in her class.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
