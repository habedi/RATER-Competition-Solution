Face on Mars? Aliens? What? Some conspiracy theorists believe that a face found on Mars from a photo taken by Viking 1 - a Mars Global surveyor -

was created by aliens who lived on the planet over 300 billion years ago. NASA released information and a picture about the 'Face on Mars,' to the media, with the caption, "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head." The face believed to be found on Mars is nothing less then a rock formation, and was not created by aliens.

Mission controller Garvin says, "It's not easy to target Cydonia." He also noted that his crew does not pass over the Face very often. This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years. Over time the wind and atmosphere has shaped the rock into the form of what looks to be a Face.

NASA leaked evidence about the Face on Mars when they unveiled the image for the public and media to see, stating clearly that the Face was formed by, "shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see the image on a JPL website, the text in fact quoted, "It was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."

The people that do believe that there was alien life on Mars, think that the aliens markings were hidden by haze, and believe the Face is "bona fide" evidence of life on Mars. Contarary to what skeptics and other theorists think, there is no actual piece of true evidence discovered by NASA to prove otherwise.

Garvin and his team said, "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyarmids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" So this actual NASA evidence that the mysterious "Face" found on Mars was nothing but a simple landform.

The NASA Space Program has been around for decades. NASA has not yet found evidence to consider the Face on Mars was alien artifacts. Even with NASA's best cameras, there just isn't a theoretical proven fact that this could have become an artifact from ancient aliens. The Face on Mars, is not a face, but simply a landform, that was formed over billions of years ago.
