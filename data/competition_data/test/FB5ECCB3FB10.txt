Dear principal,

I don't think it is fair for students to need a B average to participate in sports, because many students in this school have a C average. That would mean very little people would be able to participate in the sports. You may think that by doing this, students will raise there grade in order to participate but coming from a student, i can tell you that this will not make them raise there grades, they will just no longer want to participate in the sport.

Another reason is because, many people play sports to get there mind of off the long day at school, also to be with friends and have something other then school work to do. It would not be fair for the students with C or lower averages to not be able to have fun, and be with there friends while doing something they want to do.

My last reason is that, sports are a fun way to get exercise. why should the kids with B or higher be the only ones that can exercise and have fun with there friends? I do not think that making participation for sports based on grade average is a good idea. because it means that many students do not get to exercise, get there mind off school, and have fun with there friends. Its not fair to many students. That is why you should not make sport participation based on grade average. Thank you sincerely,

A student.
