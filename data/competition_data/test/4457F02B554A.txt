Drivers should not be able to use a cell in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I feel like that's the least safe thing you can do while a driving a motored vehicle. I think all of your undivided attention should be focused on driving. Your life isn't the only one in harm, but you're also jeopardizing someone else's life putting them in harm. Safety first; extracurricular activities later.

First of all, driving while you're on your phone is very dangerous and can be life threating within just 5 seconds. Most car accidents today are from people who were distracted by their phones. According to statistics from "The National Safety Council", cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. I feel like if more people were less distracted by their phones then there would be fewer car accidents than there are today. One out every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Second of all, though you may be only replying to a quick text or answering a quick call, but those few seconds you took to look at your phone traffic is still going. I agree that phones should not be in use while operating a vehicle because not only does the phone user get dangerously injured, it could cause someone else get hurt, too. I would advise anyone to not get caught driving while using their device now today because there are consequences.

A cell phone should not be used while operating a vehicle because driving should be number one priority.

Third of all, although I feel as if phones shouldn't be prohibited while operating a car but there are some reasons it would be reasonable to use your phone while driving. I think the only reason you should use your phone is too answer important calls only nothing more. The only way you could answer those important calls are if you have Bluetooth and your phone is connected. I feel that if you have to remove your hand from the steering wheel to use your phone you shouldn't. I say phones should shouldn't be used at all inside of a vehicle that on.

Most of all, drivers shouldn't use their phone while driving because it's very life threatening and dangerous. Driving while texting doesn't only just put your life in harm it puts others that are around. Texting and driving is a big distraction; focus should always be number priority while driving. Most accidents that occur today are from distracted drivers who were on their phone .Even though they were on phones for short amount of time, within that time span a car accident can occur.
