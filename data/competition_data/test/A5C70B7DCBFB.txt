Dear Mr. Principal

We believe we should be-able to use our cell phones during our lunch period and other free times. All of us agree because there is no point in having our cell phones off all day. This is because maybe our parents sent us a text saying not to take the bus home because they're going to come and pick us up or , that we have to ride with someone else after school because they have to work late.

But if we don't get that text we end up going on the wrong bus or we miss our only open doctor's appointment we can get in two months because it is the time of year where everyone is getting sick. What do we if we end up getting home but we didn't get that text then we're stuck there and it's winter and we forgot our house-key because our parent's were supposed to be home, not picking us up from school.

But, if we do have our phones during a free passing zone or at lunch-time then we can get that text message saying to not ride the bus home and/or to ride home with this person because our parents have to work late. If we don't get that call or text and we go to the bus and just then get the text to go with that other person, then you have to run back out to the circle drive and you were too late getting there because your ride already left and you live clear in the country , how are we going to get home? The only thing we can do is to wait for our parents to get off work (really late) at the school , who's doors closes at 4:45 P.M anyway. Then we have to wait in the cold for another three to four hours for our parent(s) to get there.

Then because of waiting in the cold all that time the next morning you realize you are sick and you can't go to school. But, that day you have three tests, and many quizzes what do you do then, go to school with a fever and not feeling well to get all your tests done, or stay home and then miss all the new studies started after the tests in each class?

Would you like to be in that position, Sir? Because we know we wouldn't. So we believe we should be able to have cell phone use during our lunch periods and during our other free time. We should not be in the spot where all because we didn't get a text message we went the wrong way.
