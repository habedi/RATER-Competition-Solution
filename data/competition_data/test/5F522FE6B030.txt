Dear, principal

Your idea of changing the school policy of students must have a C average or better to participate in sports or other activities could upset some of the students. By changing the policy to, you must have at least a B average or better to participate in sports or other activities will make some students previously eligible to now being ineligible. This change could affect some of the students view of you as a principal, and it could also anger some of the parents that has a child with a C average but really enjoys him/herself in an activity or sport.

By changing the policy and making some students ineligible, forcing them to be kicked off the team or group due to insufficient grades might affect the whole teams moral and overall performance due to lack of players or participants, this might affect the outcomes of some games/competitions.

If a team that was previously a good competitor in a league or tournament but now due to lack of players is either ineligible to participate or is no longer a strong competitor could possibly upset both parents, students, and could affect the image of the school by a sports stand point.

I am writing you this letter in protest to the new change. I calmly advise and ask that you do not change the current school policy of, a student must have at least a C average to participate in sports or other activities, to a student must have at least a B average to precipitate in such things. For this could have adverse affects on the students, the school, the parents, and possibly the community.
