Dear Principle,

As you know, many of your students here at SCHOOL_NAME like to help out in community service. In fact, over 1,000 of us here do help out. Shouldn't we require more students to help out as well, since the population of Florida, the state that we live in and cherish is over 1,000,000, 1,000 times more than the quantity of students that actually help out? I believe you, as the person in authority, should. Without community service, our world would be a wasteland in which non-contributors are useless people who sit around on there couches like "couch potatoes" and do nothing but watch television all day. If we don't want to end up like that, then you should require us to do community service because we would be helping others, we would build our kindness and morals, and we would express not only ourselves, but the whole state as good people.

Us, the next generation of future adults, should act for our state and our country by doing community service because it assists others. It is a proven fact that humans make mistakes, and without the help and assistance of our peers, we wouldn't be anywhere in life like we are today. The same is true for other lost, lonely people in the world who are stuck in a "sticky situation". It is our duty to help them by performing community service. By doing community service, we would be helping those in need, an important factor in life today. Please consider the benefits you and the whole nation will reap from allowing us to perform community service, each and every one of us.

Doing community service also provides the kindness and morals that we, especially at this age, need. When we do community service about 100 times per two years, we would be helping out over 100 people in those years. Multiply that by the thousands of students we have here at SCHOOL_NAME will increase this tenfold. Doing all of this community service will increase our kindness levels and morals, making us a better person inside as well. When we grow up to become adults, we will need this kindness to prepare for the next generation and vice versa. If you allow us to do community service, it will increase our morals and kindness, which will be a continuity for hundreds of future generations, making our whole world a better place, so think of the world when you make this decision.

Community service also allows us to represent ourselves and the whole nation as kind people that like to help others. Without community service, this would be highly unlikely to happen. So it would be good to put the United States of America back in the running for best and cleanest nation out there. Think of all the great kids just having their potential wasted, being branded as bad students. Community service will help clean and revitalize those children, allowing them to express themselves and become "good apples". Please take this into consideration when you make your decision, TEACHER_NAME.

Community service is the exact opposite of a crime, as you help others, build your morals, and express the nation as your good self. In fact, it is so much opposite, it should be a crime, but thankfully it is not. It would be hard to perform community service by everyone, but that doesn't mean that they absolutely can't and that all of your students aren't capable. If you ponder on this though of having our generation perform beneficial tasks such as community service, I'm telling you, you won't be sorry.
