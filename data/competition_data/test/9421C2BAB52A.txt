I think that the new software, the Facial Action Coding System, is actually amazing and wierd at the same time. It can be interesting towards some people and not to other because it can make people feel uncomfortable.

Read peoples emotions without the persons consent might make them feel quite vulnerable or uncomfortable. Dr, Eckman has only classified six basic emotions. Happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness were the six emotions. I think that are more than just six basic emotions that need to be taken into consideration. I do agree when Dr. Haung said, "Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression." Caculating the extent of someones real emotion or expression is very difficult for trained professionals to actually get how a person might be feeling, so how can a computer know? I think just by measuring the persons muscles on their face it can just be a fake smile just looking like a real smile. Using this technology in different locations and settings could be very helpful. If the prodect accuratly can measure exactly how a person might be feeling. They could use it in law inforcment to caculate sadness, happiness, being suprised, or being nervous. When the article says, "While looking in the mirror," it made me imagian myself looking in the mirror and trying the steps. Reading through paragraph nine and seeing, ("Putting on a happy face" actually work!) I completely agree with that statment because acting like you are hapy can actually help you be happy. I know that from personal experience. When I look at other people and see they are sad, I get sad or if I look at people that are excited i get excited.

This new technology can be very effective if it can actually tell the emotions of a person, not just the expression. This invention can help a lot of people understand one another. Understanding one another and ones emotions can lead to more peace in the world.
