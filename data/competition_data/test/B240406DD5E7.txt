Dear Principal

The reason why i' m writing this letter is because I heard that you're reflecting whether you should start making us do community service. Well my opinion is that I think we shouldn't have to do it. My reasons are because I have things to do such as do homework, study, and go to practice and I barely have any time to do all that. For example I have to walk home therefore when I get there its already 4 o'clock. then it take me 1 hour to do my homework. Then I go to practice and thats 2 hours and it takes me a good 30 minutes to get home. When I get home it time for me to get in the shower and go to bed. If you were to have us do community service I will have to do it on the weekends. I support my reasons and i hope you will to. Thank you talk to you later.

Sincerly, STUDENT_NAME
