Dear principal. I think policy #1 is the best policy for the school because us teen agers like to be on the phone to talk to friends or relatives and during lunch all were doing is having free time anyways were talking to are friends and eating so i don't know why it should be a big deal on not leting us use are cell phones at lunch time and for free time in class you should allow us to use are phones because were just having free time were not learning any thing new but during class time are phones should be off like you said because its class time not lunch time or free time. That's why i think policy 1 is the best thing. But see you teachers can be on the phone at any time you want so that's why i say let us be on are phones at lunch or during free time because we like to talk to are friends cousins if they don't go to the same school we do and all were doing is texting or calling i don't see why that should be a big deal. So once again that's why i say policy 1 is the best policy for the school.
