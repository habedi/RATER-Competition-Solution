Hi my name is Luke and I am person who is working in two part jobs. I work at a grocery store and a bank. My friend Don invited me to join the Europe on a cattle boat. It helps people in need of food, a home, farming and much more.

It is called the UNRRA meaning the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. I want more people to come and help because you are doing a deed to people around the world that needs your help with farming,getting food, and getting a home. The UNRRA has over 44 nations helping with these people in need, but we need more. ''The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy''. I had lots of fun times on the boat as well. This is not just work it is also about fun. When we travel to give people stuff in need, we will play games like Tennis, volleyball, baseball, pool, and much more activities to do.

I think that you should come down to the UNRRA. First, you are helping people that needs it. Second, You can come and hang out also have fun when doing it. Third, it's an unbelievable deal for a small-town boy.
