Why Students Should do a Extra Curricular Activity

Have you ever been stressed and need something to clear your mind? That is why students should be required to do at least one extra curricular activity. Extra curricular activities is a great opportunity that every kid should be required to do because it lets you take your mind of of school and do something that you enjoy with your friends.

Extra curricular activities are a great way to meet new people and practice life skills. I moved to a school this year and I new very few people, but then I joined a extra curricular activity and I met a lot of people. This also means that people from a grade can still hang out with someone from a different grade level. Meeting people gives you great life skills because you learn how to greet people and you learn how to be more social and less shy. This means that people meet a lot of new people and they learn a lot about each other. You also learn their points of view. You learn a lot of different perspectives on how to fix certain problems that our would is facing. With all of those points of views, you can learn the best ways to fix the problems. Some people may say that you can do that outside of an extra curricular activity, but that is wrong because if you go to the grocery store you would not stop every one that is going down the isle and talk to them for 30 minutes. If you were a part of an extra curricular activity, you would have the chance to talk longer because you are with them after school for a long time.

Extra curricular activities are also a great way to do something that you enjoy. I joined a extra curricular activity and I am always exited to go there after school and have fun. I love doing it and I would not be able to do it at home. This means that I have a lot of fun doing what I love with new friends that I can hang out with. It also lets you not stress over school and think about something happy and exiting. Some people may say that anything you do at the school you can do at home, but that is not true because some people that go to the public schools can not afford it and even If you did, you would still need to bring people to your house to play it. If you did bring people over to do that it would be the same thing as having it at you school, but worse because it is less convenient and the school pays for the equipment. If you did it at your house you would have to pay. Some parents can not even pick their kids up until a little later so it gives them something fun to do. That is why it is a great way to do something that you enjoy.

Extra curricular activities should also be enforced because it lets people try new things that they may not be able to do at home. It is always good to try new things because you do not know if you like it. You may be really good at it, but you never know until you try. If you hate that extra curricular activity than their are a lot more and I am sure that you will find some that you really love and enjoy. This means that you find something you love and can connect to other people that love that activity as well. Some people may say that you can connect with people that do not do an extra curricular activity, but that is not true because it would be very hard to ask a lot of people what they love to do outside of school. If you do an extra curricular activity, it would be a lot easier to connect and you may end up being great friends at school and maybe even in the future. It is a lot easier to make connections and get to know each other if you spend a lot of time together.

Extra curricular activities also lets you meet new people. Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities.
