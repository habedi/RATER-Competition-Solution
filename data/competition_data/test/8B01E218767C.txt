Dear Principal ,

I disagree with the fact that students may bring their cell phones to school . Students may over use the freedom of bringing the phone to school. The students may find a sneaky way of using the cell phone during class, in the hallway or anywhere where it "can not" be seen. This can also cause a problem with the students school work. The student paid attention to their cell phone more than they paid attention in class can cause a bad reputation for the school. Students will lose focus during class time just because of a cell phone .Their grades and future may fall apart just because of their cell phone use in class. Cell phone use can cause to students cutting class and cutting class may lead into a failing grade, gang or worst. Kids can also get robbed for their phones and other things they may have with them. There is times where students do need their cell phones just incase an emergency may occur. Cell phones should be allowed but if seen during classes it should immediately be taken away until a guardian comes and picks it up. Cell phones during "free time" shouldn't be used because some students aren't responsible enough to know the appropriate time to use their phones.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
