The technology we use today is very different from back then. People updated their software to make the pictures more clear and also to change their forms to the way people who's taking the picture. In paragraph "1" the author says "the software is the latest innovoton from Proft"," Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for Advance science at the University of Illionois" its giving an example of where did the newest software came from.

In paragraph "1" its also telling how Dr. Huang think how humans and communicate. Well I believe that humans and computers are better to communicate with each other because the computer can help the human gets it's way how they want people want to work with other different stuff and switch up the picture or also move it around. In paragraph "3" the text sates " computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscules in the model must move like human muscles",the author is telling us how the computer and other techonology can scan your face and to see whos the person is. But it have to be moving around like human muscles.

In fact the author stating that Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of Facial Action Coding System had classifeid six basic emotions happiness, surprise,anger, disgust,fear and sadness. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. In paragraph "4" the author says " By weighting the different units,the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared againist a neutral face showing no emotion". In papagraph "6" it's also telling how if you frown a classrom cmputer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

In conclusion this passage is telling me how technology changed over a few years, but it might get better over time and have more diffenent features to it.
