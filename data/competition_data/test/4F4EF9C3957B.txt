Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. In other words students could be helped a lot if they have the option to do school from home.

On the other hand, some students would not benefit through doing school at home. For some students it would be harder to motivate them to do their school from a comfy space like at home.

Students could benefit from doing school at home because they could graduate earlier,they can do it when the time is best for them,and students could have more time to get the assignments done.

Students can graduate earlier with this oppunrity when they can just focus entirely on school. They would not have to worry about being late to class, school drama, nothing but learning. Students can start collage earlier with this oppuntity. These kids can do their school basically anywhere. Students could fast track their plans and start their lives earlier. They could also get fully into the work force faster with this option.

Students who don't have time to actually sit down and go to school, could take school with them where ever they go. Instead of being in school for 7-8 hours a day, students can take as many brakes as they need too while doing school at home. This could also help kids who have jobs because they could work more instead of not being able to work just because your in school all day. This option could also be beneficial to students who play sports after school,it could give them more time to train. The Students who would be most beneficial to this option are the kids who suffer from bad social anxiety, physical bullying,mental health issues because they would not have to deal with it on a daily bases in school. This also could be an option for the kids who dont have transportation to and from school everyday.

A lot of students have a harder problem turning in their work because they don't have enough time to complete all the assignments, so their grades suffer. With this option to do school at home the kids would have more time to do the assignments and they would be easier to turn in all online. With having more time on the assignment then students can learn at their own pace and wouldn't have to worry about falling way behind in class if they miss a set of directions. If the student needed help with an assignment they could email the school and work something out to get the help that they need.

If students have the option to do school at home then it could be very beneficial to so many students because they could graduate earlier, they can do the work when the time is best for them, and they have more time to complete the assignments.
