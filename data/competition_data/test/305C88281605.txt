The Electoral College should stay because it lets other people choose the president on behalf of the people. The Electoral College helps so that there is not a big problem with people going and having to do all that work themselves. Some people dont like having to vote the way the Electoral College does so they just take the majority vote and puts that in for us so we dont have to do it. It lets us choose and go home so that were not goin out all day waiting for so many people to do the majority now its all online which makes it even easier to tally it all up and see who gets the vote.

The Electoral College is just making everything alought easier for us and we are able to spend less time in a voting area waiting for people to get done. The online voting helps out alought because we are able to get everything done a whole lot easier then others. There is also a smaller line with the online thing so that most people dont have to wait as long. Unless you get that one person who is taking forever and doesnt want to leave the booth then you are there all day and nobody wants that to happen because that would not leave you having a good day for nobody.

But the majority vote could be good to only having to split up the vote and the president is whoever got the most votes. But the only outcome of that is someone not liking the president or the president isnt doing very well in anything and he just sits there not doing anything. Then that president would have to be impeached and we will have to get a new president and nobody wants to go through that. Some people might want to go through that and get a new president only because they dont like him or hes not doing to well in anything or he is just a stoubern president and doesnt like makeing rash decisions. But that president is going to have to get over that.
