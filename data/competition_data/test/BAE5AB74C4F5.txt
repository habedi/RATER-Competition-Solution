Dear, TEACHER_NAME:)

I believe we should have our phones at school, that way if something happens we can call our mother or father. So they can come get us. We should have phones out at lunch that way we can talk with our friends from a other school, and with our friends that our out they day. And if they are anything like me they love to text.

But they are to scared to get it out, to text their friends so it just stays put up and turned off. Un-till they get on the bus and then they text a way. But we should have our phone so we can text our mother and father and tell them what is going on and if we are doing good or if we don't feel good and need to go home.

But most people have a phone so they will all say the same thing i am, because they love to text to. If you have a phone then you love to text. And they would love be get them out at lunch or free time and take picture and listen to music.

And i know i would love to get my phone out and show it off and show what i got and stuff like that, but i will also let my friends who don't have a cell phone play with mine and stuff. I do it all the time, i like to let my friends use my stuff.

I get sick a lot so this way i can text my mother and tell her that i don't feel good and then she will come get me. But all child have something that's not right going on in the life an just need to text their family and see how they are doing and what has all happened.

Please TEACHER_NAME think about it!!!! And if you tell them they can't have them they still will! So why not get let them?

Thank You,
