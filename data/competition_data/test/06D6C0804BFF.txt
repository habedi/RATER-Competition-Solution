Cars are a very usable objects in the kind of society that we are living in today. But with great things comes bad things too. The limit of car usage in any places of the world would have an effect on every one . It could be good, it could be bad. But when it comes to the envirenment, limiting car usage can even help prevent certain problems that people don't realy pay attention to. Prolems like pollution and the government wasting money in highways for cars than trying to find safer ways for transportation.

Like many factories, cars give out bad smoke from the pipe under the back of the car. When that smoke goes in the air and get mix with the air, it would create pollution. Now the pollution would create bigger  problems like the rise of the greenhouse gas emission and  it could also create global warming wich could lead to much worse stuff that I would not get into. All you have to know is that global warming could lead to the destruction of the earth.

In France, their government decided to enforce a driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Based on facts cited in source two, the city of paris was near-record pollution. On my personal experiances, I know what car smoke can do to people. One of my uncles died in Haiti because he inhale too much car smoke. It knind of messed up his lungs.

People are suprisinly over the crisis of cars. But apperently the government deosn't realise that, since based on source 1 it stated "80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. Bycicles are a much safer way to travel. Though cars are faster, but it is way easier to crash in cars, and bycicles does not release bad smoke that can culminate to pollution .
