i think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vauable.

i think its vauable because it would be a good idea if a computer can see what im feeling because if i feel confused it could help me understand what i dont get. Once it sees that im starting to get it, its going to keep on doing what its doing so it can help me out. It could see that im happy if i see something that i really like and show me more things about it. It would see if i dont like something its going to make sure for me not to see the things i was seeing. It is going to see every emotion i have towords something.

it would be easier for a teacher too because some of the students wont get what the teacher is saying so once they get on the computer the computer is gonna be able to see if he or she gets whats the teacher talking about and if they dont the computer will ba able to pull something out the internet so it couldhelp the students.

I think its a idea to have technology rad our emotional expressions because it will help us understand things and make things easier
