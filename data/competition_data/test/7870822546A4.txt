Do you want your child to work harder. Our students will this is why At an age students will start to work and we are here to prepare them for it.

At our school they will work hard, thats why we believe that students should have an extracurricular activity.

If we add an extracurricular activity your child will gain more work experience. So when they start to work the students will have some kind of idea how hard it's going to be. And if we add an activity they will be ready to work harder. Also it can teach students to work at home too they will help you.

It can also affect there grades will go up too as they realize how it's going to be. They will start to try harder and do there very best so when college comes they will already have work experience.

and they will be prepared for the work they get, to work hard on it.

Besideses who said the activity is boring. It can also be fun we will have a verity of choices for the students to choose from. And it will help students be more active it is fun. It will also increase students particpation in more classes since they been more active. So it will be enjoyed for students to come to school also they will be less boared in class. If they have somthing fun to do, it will challenge the students too. And an may help a students find a passion in one of these activity for the work force as well. This activity may also allow students to take a break and enjoy there passion like soccer, football,baseball,and basketball or drawing,reading, and writing.
