Dear Principal,

I believe that only allowing students with a grade average of at least a B is unfair. Students should be able to participate in the activities they enjoy no matter what, and they should not be discriminated if their grades aren't at the tip of the peak.

There are few sources in town besides school that these kids can take part in a sport or other activity, and taking away their activities that they enjoy is taking away their rights.

If a student has low grades, but loves basketball with all their heart, It would be terrible to take that away from them. Everybody is good at something, and bad at others, it's part of being human. A student may not have the best grades, because education may be their weakness and athletics is their strength.

I believe that in the long run, it is important that a student is successful in their future life. If someone was set on pursuing an athletic career, why do they have to have excellent grades in classes. As long as they are trying their best in school, they deserve their rights. A proper education is very important for success, but if they are the best in what they want to do for the rest of their lives, that should be all that matters.

What may improve the grades of athletes is scheduling practices at convenient times, which allow them to get all their school work completed before practice. Doing so will allow the students to focus more on their work. Another option is to cut practices shorter. If they are not as long, students will have more time to do the things they need to in order to help their grades.

It is important that kids stay healthy and active, and not allowing them to play sports is depriving them of exercise that is needed for them to grow. People who exercise on a regular bases are happier people, and of course, healthier people.

I hope you take my concern into consideration, because I know many other students who would agree with a lot of the things I mentioned.

Sincerely,
