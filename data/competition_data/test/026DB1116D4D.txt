Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Today I am writing you a letter about my concerns with the new policy that students with less then a B average can not tryout for sports or other activities.

I personally dislike the policy because most of the students here have a C average and if that's the case then there wouldn't be very many players on the sports team. Which also restricts the coaches choice in selections which isn't fair to them and the players who care about working hard to make the team not making the teams because there weren't enough other players trying out.

Another reason i feel the policy is unjust is because students with learning disorders or who struggle may start the year off really low on the grade scale it'll be a lot harder for them to pull there grades up. Along with the reason many students probably wouldn't be able to pull there grades up in time for try-outs because of the sudden change.

Also I feel the policy is unreasonable because a B Is a grade very hard to attain let alone maintain. For example if a student had a B but missed a few days in school the students grade would go down for missing the work that day and even if they did the work and handed it in most classes you don't get the full one hundred because it wasn't handed in the day it was due so there grade only goes up to a C or C+.

Thank You for taking the time to read my letter i hope you take it in to serious consideration.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
