Dear Senator,

I am writing this letter to inform you of how I think changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be better than keeping the electoral college. Back in 1960, in the Louisana legislature, segragations nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Occasionally, electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state. With an electoral college it's the electors who elect the president, not the people. The Electoral College method of selecting the president can turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to exspress a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.
