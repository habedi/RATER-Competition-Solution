The reason I think people should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboy program is because you go places where you will probably never get to see. If you do sign up for the program you will get to take care of animals,clean stallls and,water and feed them,I think it would be good for the kids to get out of there normal rutine on their phones,video games. I think it would be an amazing experience just because i love people and helping them would make me feel better if I just helped one person. That will get you places in life if you help people in need, it makes you feel good about yourself. That is the reason i think people should sign up for the program.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an adventure opportunity of a lifetime. This paragraph is filled details that agrue with people who don't want to go to Europe on a cattle boat to Europe.

The reason I want people to go on a cattle boat and trasnport animals,food and,water for the nedding people, is because I want people to get out and explore the world and see what is going on around them, and get off there phones and ipads. People need to get see more than just there phone screenand explore, like The Amazon, the jungles that are in Jamica and everywhere like that. I think it would be good for people to get out, even if you don't have enough money. Still get out of the house and explore. That is why I want people to get out more and sign up for the a Seagoing Cowboy program.
