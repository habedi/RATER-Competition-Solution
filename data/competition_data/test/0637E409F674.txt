For the people that are reading this passage, im supposed to explain to you why limiting car use is an amense deal to humans. Everyone is just so used to driving everywhere, because, its faster and easier to get from point A to point B. Now think back to how people back then got from point A to point B, they didnt have cars, or trains they had Feet. Most of us are selfish enought not to walk or use public transportaion, and help stop greenhouse effect.

By limiting car use, we are able to enjoy the air around much better. Theres a town that banned cars. They would rather walk then drive, most of them sold there car just to live somwhere much more peacfuly.
