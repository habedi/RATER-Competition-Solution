I think that having technology that can read emotions in a class room would be a good idea because it can show where kids tend to feel self consious about certian taskes they are asked to do. Some kids may feel excited to get up in front of their class to do a speech or presentation, while others may feel the need to hide. This can also help with social behaviors by showing how kids react when palying a competive game or trying to get along with others they may not know well.

For kids who tend to be more quite in school communicating can be on the difficult side. By putting these technologies in PC's or other computers, teachers can help those students work on their skills based on where they tend to react. The author takls about how most human interaxtion is non-verbal. Their claim is "Most human communication is non-verbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that to." Dr. Huang wnats to explain that maybe if the game can tell that the child paly is feeling frustated that the game system can help them through until they feel more confident. This kind of technology can indicate whether a person is actually happy or just faking it. The author writes, "They even indicate the differnece between a genuine smaile and a forced one." The computers can even go imdepth enough to prove that its faked based on the way that the muscles are reacting. As claimed by the author, "In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheeck bones) lift the corners of your mouth." These emotion readers can indicate where and when a childs emotion can change.

In conclusion, emotion readers can help teachers tell when kids feel differently about something even if they show a different expression. Although people may think they are being watched, adding these feature in school PC's would be a good idea. These features will help get a better understanding of what really puts pressure on students at any age and grade level. This will also help studies to see if somethings that are done in school are too much fo one to handle based on their age and emotions.
