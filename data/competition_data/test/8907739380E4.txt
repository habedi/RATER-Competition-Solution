Dear,

TEACHER_NAME

I think doing community service is a good thing and I want to join the program, but I think it should be done to students who want to do it, we don't want them to be arguing about how they could be doing something better right now and then they could convince other students to not support your program. I would encourage you to start it with other schools too because there is a lot of people out there who could use our help and breathe in fresh air. hopefully they will appreciate our good work for cleaning parks and walking around neighborhoods picking up trash. It would be a nice thing if our community was a safe community. We should start off by cleaning up our school and help the janitors clean up after a spills or baby sit our little brothers and sisters for free so our parents could use that money for something more important. Hopefully other kids and teens support your community service program and that it turns out the way u planned it.

Signed,
