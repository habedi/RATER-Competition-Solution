The author states that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, venus is a really hot planet and the earth is in between venus and mars but venus is closer to earth. Scientists start to study venus but it's very too hot to go to venus so scientists try to make inventions that will get information on why venus is so hot. Venus is dangerous because it is soo hot and you wouldn't make it in the conditions there.

In paragraph 3 the author states " Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments". It also states some examples of the dangerous things like "erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes ". Scientists are still trying to visit to venus surface even tho it's inhospitable because they are fascinated by venus because venus use to be the earth's most-like planet in our solar system. Scientistist wants to know what it is that is making venus sooo hot because like in paragraph 4 it says " long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life". Then scientistst study that venus is the hottest planet and they are now trying to study why venus is so hot.

Now NASA is trying to send humans to study venus. NASA also has a solution for scientists to go study venus in paragraph 5 it says " NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray" NASA made this solution so that scientists would study venus but at the same time they would be safe while doing it . NASA is now workin on other approaches to studying venus. In paragraph 7 the author states " some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions". This also shows that tying to study venus is dangerous because you wouldn't make it very long on the planet even if you've invented things to try and help.

The author is trying to get out that studying venus can be very dangerous because of the conditions venus is going thorugh. Venus is the most hottest planet and it is not the best planet to be studying because it is very dangerous.
