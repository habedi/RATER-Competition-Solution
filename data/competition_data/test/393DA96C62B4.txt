NASA discouvered a weard landform on Mars that lookes like a face. Some scientest, and people think that it is a sign of life or aliens. Most scientist think that it is a landform not aliens. I allso think that it is just a landform because Scientist have found simmilar landforms on Earth.

JPL Web site revealed to the public that it was a natural landform. The landform had nothing to do with aliens or life. But not everyone was satisfied. The face was located 41 degreas north martain latitude where it was winter in April 98 a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet.

The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, aliean markings were hidden by haze. Mission controllers looked again, Mars Global Surveyor is a maping spacecraft That normaly looks straight down and scans the planet.

Like a fax machine in narow 2.5 km wide strips They dont know if it pasced over the face very often. Sur veyors then got another pictuer using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

They discrern things in digital image 3 times bigger than pixel scize. So if ther were objects in this picture like airplans on the ground or shacks you could see what they were. What the picture actualy shows is the Martain equiveliant of a Buttel or mesa Landforms comon around the American West.
