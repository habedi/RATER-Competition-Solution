Dear Principal,

Community service is designed to help the community in which volunteer's take on the jobs of things that help out our community. Many kids are out there doing community service while there are kids who decide that community service is not quite worth their time or they have "better" things to do. Community service should be mandatory to all students at our school to help the community out.

Kids currently doing community service choose to because there is so many benefits to it. Such as: It may go onto your college application, many high-school's require you do community service anyway so why not start early? Also, doing community service benefits everyone inside your community. Many people are sometimes not as fortunate as you to have the things you have. So, doing community service helps them out. Overall, doing community service should make you as a person feel better about yourself.

Many kids feel that they have better things to do then doing community service. Sure, playing video games or just sitting there doing nothing may sound better to you yourself, but to others not so much. When you do community service it takes kids involved with terrible things such as drugs, alcohol, and smoking off of that because now they do not have that time to go ahead and do those terrible things.

So, when making kids do this community service it makes the less fortunate and the fortunate people all better overall.

I ponder why kids our age feel as to where community service is just some "stupid thing." Well, I am sure to you and I and many other people out there in the community feel that community service enhances our community to a better place.

When or if you decide to press community service on all the kids in our school just remember to not be so harsh and forceful. Make it more fun and appealing to the kids. Don't make it feel like its a punishment instead, make it feel like a privilege. This will make more kids want to do it, instead of dreading it. To help, make some fun activities in the community for the kids to do. When they do these activities make it possible for the kids to come together and socialize like they would do without having these community service hours on their mind.

Making kids who do community service benefits everyone. Overall, it would be to everyone's favor if they have to do community service. Present this to our school in the most nicest and exciting way possible.

The whole world will become a better place with community service and having our school join that team is one huge step towards a nicer world.

Sincerely,

Your Student
