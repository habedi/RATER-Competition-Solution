dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to let you know how i feel about you letting the students perform community service. I think it is a great idea on how to let students take responsibility for themselves. Students for example can help out the community by going green. Going green is a better way to make this community much cleaner and safer for example (1)pick up the trash.(2)recycle.(3)don't litter.

I also think community service is great because its always a good idea to give a helping hand. For example last summer a friend and i volunteered at a museum for kids called stepping stones, what we did was help kids out with what ever they needed in terms of playing with the learning habitats.

My friend and i received credit for school since we did that. so i say why not give the students a chance to help out in this community do something good once in a while .maybe you and a friend will love it so much you may want to do it again.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
