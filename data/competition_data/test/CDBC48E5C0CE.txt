Schools that offer online learning from home may benefit from it because they are able to focus more on the subjects from home because they have less distractions. Also some students may go at a slower pace than others so this could help students that go at a slower pace to catch up and fully understand the concept of the course the student is taking. In most cases the way students learn are all very different and online school helps students who can't learn the traditional way.

When students go to school sometimes they can get distracted with friends and might not pay attention to the material being taught and later on be confused when the quiz or the test comes. while when it comes to online school the students are taught most of the information the will need to know for the subject and be able to learn without being distracted by friends or anything else. Also students would be able to do better academically because they would not have anything to distract them. Also being less distracted the student would be able to focus on things they need to have done for class and not slack off talking or hanging out with friends.

Some students may have trouble understanding or keeping up with the subject material the class is being taught and the class ;it may be moving very fast for them. Schools that offer online school may help students that learn at a different pace than others do better in the classes and understand the subject more in depth. Also online schools would be able to help by going at the students speed instead of the standardized classroom speed of the subject. The student would also be able to talk to their online teacher one on one and ask questions if the student has any.

Also some methods of teaching are not for everyone because every student learns in a different ways. All students don't learn the same way because some of our brains are wired different than other people and most of the time school is built for a specific type of person. many people learn from imagery, sound or visually but we are not all built the same. Online school can help students learn in a way that is designed for them and be able to understand the topic better because the teacher may have taught it in a way a student can understand it.

Some parents may be skeptical that online school because they think their child will lose social interaction with other kids but I assure you thats not the case of have plenty of friends who take online school. To be honest most of my friends like it more than going to public school because there less distracted by friends and more focused on school and have a lot more time to do things they love. Also online school doesn't mean your not going to have social interaction with people because in most cases people who do online school are able to make friends in other places and do activities that they like and enjoy. Another advantage to online school is that its flexible and you can make it work in your favor if you do all the things required.

So in many ways online school is a great opportunity for students because they are able to focus more on the subjects because they have less distractions. Also some students may go at a slower pace than others so this could help students that go at a slower pace to catch up and understand the material. One way of teaching a subject may not be as effective as other ways of teaching because we all learn in different ways. In many ways online school has helped many students achieve academic success with the way courses are paced and one on one teachers explaining and helping students grasp the concept better it has definitely helped students in amazing ways.
