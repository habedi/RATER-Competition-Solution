To begin with, limiting distractions from learning could make a large difference in how effecient students are in their learning; that is why distance learning is so beneficial to students. With students being in the comfort of their own home they can just simply focus on their education, they dont have to worry about distractions like other students conversing with them. There are so many distractions in the classroom that students could avoid if they were learning from home such as: social status or being popular, bullying, disciplinary action, and trying to fit in.

With the convience of distance learning student's also dont have to worry or stress about a teacher teaching to fast. Distance learning is so convient that students dont even have to worry about a bus getting them to school late, causing them to miss importat information.

Distance learning could teach students responsibility because it makes them stay on top of their own assignments and be responsible for their own assignments. While in contrast to school teachers are always forcing students to do their assignments, that is why distance learning could make students more reponsible. The only benefit students get at learning at school is real life interaction with real people. Although since students who are learning at home dont have a teacher giving them assignments and a bell to tell them when to leave and go to class, students learning at home have to teach them themselves a liitle bit of time management to help them stay ahead of all thier assignments. Time management is a very effecient way to complete any task given in an orederly fashioned; allowing students to work more effeciently. Time management is also a skill that you will need in life so puts you at an advantage to learn it early. Distance leaning gives students a lot of benefits and teaches a lot skills such as time management and reponsiblity, but these of are just a few of them many skills that you can learn from distance learning.
