Some of the schools require work over the break. i think students shouldn't get work over the break because they did all the work during the school year. It's okay if some students want to do some work over the break or just even get some practice. If it was my choice i wouldn't let my students do work over the break beacsue its the summer and i want them to enjoy they summer but if they got to go to summer school to get to the next grade that isn't a choice they have to get that done.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed if they do give work out before the break because if you let the students do it they'll do something crazy on the project so its better if a adult give the instructions on the school work and if they do it on there own the wouldnt really understand what they are doing they'll just be doing anything that comes to they mind that they think is creative.

I think before the break the teacher should let the students that wanna do work over the break should write down some thing that he was thinking about do over the break but if that doesn't work the teacher should just give them a couple options on some things they she would be interested in.

i want all the kids to abe to enjoy they summer and dont have to worry about doing work during the bresk because summer who actually wanna do work durning the break no one they gonna want to enjoy they vaction from schools so i don't think giving the kids work during the break is a good idea for the kids.
