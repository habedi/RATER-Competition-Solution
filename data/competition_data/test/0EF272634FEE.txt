my suggestion would be you are allowed to use the cell phones in school because it would be better cause it gets boring in school and we be able to have are phone on us all times and on cause really what if there was something wrong to your family you might want to know. and again we could use them in the halls and things like that and we don't have to get in trouble for having on cause everyone knows everyone brings a phone into school and you get in trouble and your mom has to come in the school and get it from a the teacher and that's a little regulus.

It would be a good idea for phones to be allowed phones in free time and lunch and not class cause it would distracted you in class. I think we might be able just to text because if you distracted kids you will be in trouble and it want be a distraction if we all text and put it on vibrate so no one can hear the phone but just see it being use and don't have to hear any body's voice or anything.

It would help the teachers waste there time busting kid for phones in there pockets or kids texting under neath the desk trying to cover it the want have to waste there times after school for just a phone but one they have a and the text and if they get to use there phones we get to its not fare leasing to there phones going off in class. all so its a waste of the schools time just for having that as a rule no phones in school its point less cause you know and we know that your are not going to stop us for bring are phone to school.

so regardless if you still don't want us to have phones in school we are going to everyday all day until schools over so u can let us not have phones in school or u can think about wasting all the teachers times or let us bring are phones to school. they might just want to worry about kids and there studies and not care for a phones and care about all the fighting and all the kids making front of each other.
