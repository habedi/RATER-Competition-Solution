In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggests stuydying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. NASA is working to try to get as much data and informaton about venus as possible, only because soon we could all have a space trasvling place to go to thats nearlry the same as earth one day farther in studying and knioowing about venus, it is called eaths twin.

In the pasage it states "Thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challengeing are the clouds of higghly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus in venuss atmosphere. On the planets surface, temperatures avaerage over 800 degrees fahrenheit". This shows why they was considering cars that hover over the land 30 miles up because us as humans wouldnt be able to be on the ground that long survivable level's but still dangerous levels of toxic to breath.

They think venus may have life likely such as ours because at a point of time venus was half percent water and could have living things on it and alsohave closly matching looking vallys and mountains like ours, they are rally trying to take a closer look into studying and possibably making there way up to finally seeing it. In the passage it states."Venus was probablyciovered largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth..... The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys , mountain,and craters".

Basically these is all information i have givejn you for to telll you alll of what theey are trying to do wit venus and for us as good resoultes.
