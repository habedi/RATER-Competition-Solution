Dear Principal,

I think we as students should be able to participate in other school activities like, sports because, there are many of us that have a passion for these sports, like football, softball, cheer leading ,and so on; students should have to work for their grades, but they should also be able to play the sports they love at the same time, we should be able to play sports even at an " C average" because its not a D, or an E, means we are still passing, but also means we are on thin ice, the school should allow us too play on the teams of sports at school if we can also promise too keep up our grades and not let them slip any farther then a C,D or E. We all know being able too play sports on a school level team is a privilege, so why not let us play on those teams, or have that as a privilege, if we are not failing, or in danger of failing a class?
