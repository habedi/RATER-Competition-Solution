Dear Principal,

Principal I will suggest policy one. I chose policy one because then kids wont be having them on in class but when they have a free time, Because if you chose policy two, then kids in will know that they cant use cell phones at all and will use it even in class. And they have to have cell phones in any free time they have for any emergency that could happen in there family. then if they don't have cell phones they will not know. so you see u should pick policy one then they know that they will at least use it in there free time and will not use it in class. Plus you should add a little to policy one you should say that if they use the phones in class then there phones will be taken away and they will have to wait two days so they can pick them up from the office. there then they will not use the phones in class but in there free time so they wont have there phone token away. And they will know that not in class but in free times they could use them so they will prefer to use them in free times then no phone for two days and there dad and mom mad at them.

Sincerely, one of your students
