The Electoral College is a process that consists of 538 electors. The process is also the selection of the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President. The Electoral College should be changed to the election by popular vote in my opinion. Obviously having certain electors voting for president does not really take the populations vote into much consideration.

In 2012's election Obama recieved more electoral votes, but he did not win the popular vote and still got elected as president. What was even the point of the population voting if their votes did even count in the end. This upset a lot of people and probably got people to the point where they do not even want to vote anymore, cause their vote does not matter anyways. If the election was based on the populations vote, more people would vote and be happier with the results knowing that their vote actually has a say in electing the president.

Each state can only cast one vote. Wyoming has one representative and California has fifty-five but they can only cast one vote. This makes obsolutely no sense. Each state may as well have 1 representative because no matter how many they have they only get one vote. Most voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference which is what the election should be. The election shouldnt just be for 538 people to decide, it should be for the citizens of the United States of America.

Dear Mr. Senator i really hope you take this into consideration. I hope you realize that the Electoral College is upsetting the people of the United States. Without the Electoral College it wouldnt matter how big a state is or how many representatives it has because it would be the peoples votes. A large state would not get that much more attention because there would not be any representatives. Many people would realize it is a lot more fair this way. Thank you!
