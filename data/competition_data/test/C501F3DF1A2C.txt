In many places like Bogota, Colombia and Paris, France there are many advantages to not using cars because:first, it would "promote alternate transportation..." and "devoid traffic jams", and second, it would help to "...reduce smog."

To begin with,according to Source 3: Car-free day spinning into a big hit in Bogota states that "It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted..." because the Bogota leaders wanted to reduce traffic jams and promote alternative transportation. This is a great advantage because by reducing traffic jams and promoting alternative transportation, you are decreasing the number of death by car accidents and helping people with the choices of other transpotation methods.

In addition, according to Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, it states that "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."This ban was a huge advantage because in the article it states that, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..." and that thanks to the ban, "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."

In conclusion, The bans stated in Source 2 and in

Source 3 have advantages because they will "...reduce smog", "promote alternative transportation..." and "devoid traffic jams."
