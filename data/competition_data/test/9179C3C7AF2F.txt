I don't think that this system should be allowed in schools, mostly beacuse some people don't want other people to know how they are feeling. Maybe some people do. Even with this technology we don't know if that is the feeling is what the person is truly feeling.

We should maybe use this in criminal cases. The system would tell us if the defendent is getting scared and is lieing. If we could use this machine this was it would help get the bad people off the streets. Nobody should reject this idea, unless you are the bad guy around town. This system would help us in these cases.

Maybe some theipist would like to have this machine so they can quickly tell what their clients are feeling. I know that it can be hard reading other people's feeling, this would deffinantly take less time in showing the problem with the client. The less time that it would take to see how they are feeling, and the more time how they should feel.

Some places this would help, and maybe I dont see how this would help in schools. For most I dont think this should be here. No matter what I wouldn't use it. I rather have the face to face interactions with other humans and haveing them see how I feel. With the new technology coming out and learning how to read us could be bad. I'm not saying don't use it, but just be careful of how you use the technology.
