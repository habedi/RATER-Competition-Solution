Imagine this, you're on your way to eat out after a big game. You're having a good time listening to music with your teammates. Then out of nowhere everything goes silent. You've been hit and the reason is because of someone texting and driving. Texting and driving should not be allowed at all. It puts people's lives at risk including the drivers and any passengers.

In recent years' studies have shown that each year, about 1,300,000 people are killed in accidents. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. If you do decide to use your phone while driving you are 23 times more likely to have a car crash.

It has gotten so bad that texting and driving has replaced drinking and driving as lead cause of death among teen drivers. The reason is because teenagers are barely starting to drive, when they decide to use their phone while behind the wheel it distracts them from the road.

However, this is not only with teens, people no matter what age cannot and should not be multitasking while driving. They need to be aware of all their surroundings.

There have been many incidents that have to do with this. For example, a teen from

Minnesota drove past a red light and killed the other driver plus his 10-year-old daughter. Also, a driver of a pickup truck collided with a church bus in Texas. This ended up with 13 people dead.

You have to make sure that people around you aren't texting and driving as well. There has been many times that people have lost their lives due to someone else's mistake. A teenager in

Anchorage, Alaska ran through a stop light, killing 27-year-old woman and mother of 2 children.

Using your phone while driving is considered illegal in 46 states not including Arizona,

Montana, Texas and Missouri. If busted, fines range from 20 to 500 dollars. It all depends on the state. Some states consider it a criminal misdemeanor which can result in jail or prison time. To avoid any accidents or any tickets there are different things you can do. You can ignore your phone for the car ride or leave it in the back seat so you're not tempted. You can always ride with someone and ask them to check your phone for you. If you need your phone for GPS and you're by yourself, you can always invest in a phone holder that connects to your window. This way you can see where you need to go but you're not distracting yourself by touching it and putting all your focus on that.

Texting and driving should be banned in all states. It is not safe for the passengers in or around the car. So many accidents will happen if people decide to do it. There is so many different things that a person can do to avoid any crashes or fines. Texting and driving should take place in two different times. It can put you at risk to lose everything, even your own life.

Next time you're in the car and you get a text think twice before picking up your phone. Just think about it.

Don't do it.
