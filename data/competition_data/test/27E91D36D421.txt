The automobile has been a staple in human history ever since it was first  created, they have been used by people wether it was grocery shopping or during war. These days limiting car use has more advantages than ever. Such advantages are that it helps reduce the amount of pollution to the enviorment, helps people save money, aswell as it helps people become more sociable and less stressed.

The limiting of car usage has many advantages one would be that it helps to reduce pollution cuased by fuel emissions. Using vehicles creates green house emissions which cause the Earth to become hotter and then global warming becomes a big problem. According to the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." by Elisabeth Rosenthal "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive area in the United States. So limiting car usage reduces the amount of emissions produced greatly. Smog is also a great threat to the enviorment, smog is created just like fog except polluted air gets into the mix of warm days and cold nights. Then instead of getting fog there is smog a more dense unhealthy version of fog. Paris has had a rough time when  it came to smog which according to "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer resulted from the fact that "Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Saving money is a big plus to the resriction on car use. With more buildings and shopping centers being built closer to suburban area makes walking a good way to save money. Andrew Selsky author of the article "car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" made a comment on the situation in Bogota saying "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city- new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up". With more shopping centers for people to be able to reach by foot, bike, car-pool, or bus can greatly reduce the amount people spend on gas and car repairs.

Limiting the usage of cars also in a strange way helps people become more connected with each other. Limiting car use will alow people to hang out more in things such as carpooling, bike rides, walking, public transportation. Allowing for people to meet more people. Also it wil allow people to use things such as social media to stil feel connected to thier freinds without having to drive out to meet them. In another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal "The End of Car Culture" Rosenthal interviewed professor Mimi Sheller Who stated "the rise iin cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arranments,includiong the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. The restriction on car usage allows for people to meet new people through the carpool service and such things.

A limitaion on car usage would have so many advntages to people and the enviorment. It helps reduce the amount of pollution from fuel and carbon emissions, helps people save money and not need a car to get to a store or park, and have people become more connected to each other.
