The author makes a very strong statement when he says we should explore Venus. The author finds the exploration to be worthy of NASAs time. As dangerous as it may be, exploring Venus would determine whether or not it could be a new home for the human race and all other sources of life. It would be a significant breakthrough for survival.

When the author says that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, it sounds like Venus should be our next home. It is not that easy as the author exlplains. Many times NASA has sent spacecrafts to Venus to see what it had to offer. Most crafts became worthless after a short period of time on the planet. Not one spacecraft has landed on Venus in over thirty years. Zero research was able to be done due to the extremes of the planet.

The planet Venus is closer to the sun than Earth resulting in extreme temperatures around 800 degrees on the outer crust of the planet. A thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide cover Venus along with clouds made of sulfuric acid. The atmospheric pressure is also an insane extreme scaling in around ninety times that of Earth. Volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning are all challenges that come along with Venus as well.

NASA has figured out ideas to send a man to study Venus. Though he would be floating 30 miles up from the surface, we would gather more information than we have at the time. MASA is also trying to engineer a spacecraft that will be able to land on the plnaet and last as long as they need or want.

Overall the author shows the strive to gather information on Venus and how it is setting us further in the future than never before. Venus is very dangerous indeed but new ideas and theories are being made everyday trying to conquer what Venus has brought to the table. The author summarizes this as, "Our travels on Earth any beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
