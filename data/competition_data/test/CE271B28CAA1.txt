I believe the Electoral College is the best way to pick the President of the united states. The Electoral college is a proccess in which the founding fathers created as a compromie.

The compromise was between election of the President by congress and election by popular vote which was done by citizens. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. 270 votesd are required in order to have the president win by majority vote. The number of votes your state is allowed depends on the number of members in its Congressional delegation.

According to the Office of the Federal Register. "Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors". "The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party".

The election is usually held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Most of the states have a system where the "winner-take-all". Which awards the winner of the presidential candidate.

In conclusion, The Electoral Election is the best way to pick the president.
