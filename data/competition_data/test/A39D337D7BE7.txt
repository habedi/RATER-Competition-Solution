Hi im Luke. Are you interested on joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. What is that said the man in the blue shirt working at his farm. It's a program were we help ship animals across the world. We have sign ups on friday stop by if you want.

Well did you get anyone said the head of the Seagoing Cowboys. We have a total of twenty people so far taht said they were. Finally we have people because if were going to go across seas to help ship animals we will need alot more people. Where is our next place over seas. It's in Europe and they have a big hawl. I can't wait I said.

On friday there was about 20 people that said they were coming on the sign up sheet and we were already ready for them to come in and listen for our experince with the Seagoing Cowboys. Then when it came time all of them came right in and sat down, so it was my que. Thank you for coming everyone. Today I will be talking about my experiance with the Seagoing Coboys and how I think it's the best thing that ever happend to me. First of I just graduated from highschool and then I got invited to this trip over seas on a cattle boat, and I knew that I would never do that in my life so I said yes. Then when we got over seas I got involved with this program, and my job was to keep everything at night going good. This would include the ship and the animals. But, one night it was very stormy and I slipped and hit the side of the boat and broke many ribs. Which stopped me for doing anything for the next couple of days.

But, there were other fun things to see and to do accros the sea. Like baseball and volleyball because when the ship was unloaded there was alot of free space. Also, when you were shipping things you got to see alot of cool and exiting places. But, my favorite part was having the experiance to do things over seas and working with animals, and our next hawl is Europe so sign up now!
