I think policy 1 is better because cell phones are used for different things and sometimes when you really need to call someone then that's what you have a cell phone for. Cell phones are also in use just incase of an emergency. For example; if you had an accident and you need to call your parents but your teacher wont let you leave the classroom then you can just tell him/her that you need the classroom to be silent so that way you can call your parents and let them know that you need a pair of pants or something to change into because you had an accident or you can have a cell phone on you for a reason like saying that you have to go to a doctors appointment and your parents don't want to write you a note so they text the note to you so that you can show it to your teacher and so that he/she will know what's going on at school.

Also, phones can be used at school for reasons like, maybe your in the middle of texting someone at home and your not finished so you need to finish texting them. Well some people bring there phones to school for that specific reason. Or maybe just to check the time on there phones because you cant read the clock. Although, some people don't need there phones because they probably be on some website on there phone like misplace or even face book but if that was the case then the parents just not buy internet for them at all.

Sometimes they might not need a phone because they can misplace there phone easily but there parents don't care and think that its okay and just buy them a new one but what i would do is if my child lost his/her phone then i wouldn't buy or even attempt to get them a new one for a while, only because phones these days are so expensive now.
