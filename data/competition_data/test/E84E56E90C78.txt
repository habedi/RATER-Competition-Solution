participating in extracurricular activities is like going on your dream vacation, it's fun and enjoyable. i agree with the principal, students should participate in extracurricular activities, for it helps students build social skills, allows students to build friendships, and teaches students how to solve problems.

To begin with, i believe that all students should participate in extracurricular activities such as student council because, when students are participating in extracurricular activities such as student council they are developing a number of skills such as, social skills. when students are communicating with one another and expressing their opinions or beliefs they are becoming more social. For example, when student are communicating and working together with their peers.

In addition to, when students are participating in extracurricular activities such as student council, students learn how to solve problems. for instance, when students are communicating with each other to solve a problem they are developing problem solving skills.

Also, extracurricular activities allows students to develop friendships. when students are talking and communicating with other students, and working together with other students they may develop friendships. for example, when students are working together in student council they are always communicating and sharing ideas, and doing this will bring them closer together and create friendships.

however, some people believe that students should not participate in extracurricular activities because, students won't have time to study for test, less time to spend with family, and students will be tired after they get home. but i do believe that students should participate in extracurricular activities.

in conclusion, i believe that students should participate in extracurricular activities, for participating in extracurricular activities has many benefits such as, helping students develop social skills, helps students build problem solving skills, and allows students to build friendships.Â
