Dear Principal,

I think it would be a good idea to involve every student in community service. It cant do any harm. The problem is though, is that people don't want to help the community because they say it's a waste of time.

If you want to swim in the lake, it wouldn't be very safe if it was dirty. What if plastic bags seemed to float into the lake and some fish mistake it for something else and they eat it. That wouldn't be sanitary for your children to swim in the lake with dead fish floating by them. I'm sure you can get diseases. All because you didn't want to take a couple hours out of your day to help the community. What students don't understand is that it's the little things that can change the world.

I wouldn't hesitate to do community service. It's all a good cause. After you do community service it feels good to know that you made your community a better, cleaner place for everyone. And it's always nice to give back to your community.

Community service is safe. If we would ever clean up at parks, that would be something less to worry about. When mothers or fathers take their children to the park they want their baby to be safe. That wouldn't be possible if there was glass, plastic, or bags. We all know children like to play with everything they see and we wouldn't want them to get cut on some glass that was broken. Or a plastic bottle they might think is theirs and choke on the cap.

With community service, we wouldn't have to worry about these hazards. So yes, I think community service should be required for students.
