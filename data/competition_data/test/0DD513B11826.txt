In common day society texting is like a drug people around can never put their phones down for at least a day unless it's broken or turned off to where you can't use your data. Most people that mainly die or gotten into these car accidents are teenagers reports say that over two thousand and six hundred teens have died each year by texting while driving. Right now as I write this to you I am getting ready to drive but I'm late I want to be ready for the wheel I'm currently observing my parents and watching them they hate ignorant and reckless drivers who don't pay attention and they want me to be a better driver if not the best driver so I won't be like these people who wreck and die from a car accident. I am disappointed in this common day society thinking that texting is more important than their lives. It's honestly sad that either drunk driving or texting while driving is more of a common issue of death than common reasons like strokes or heart attacks or natural causes like old age. Many people believe texting and driving isn't the issue it is the issue though people are just trying to ignorant to believe the lies that the media are teaching them but not me I am going to outshine the laws and not die from a car accident but rather old age when It's my time to go I will go not anytime early. But many people don't appreciate life until their stripped away from it instead of watching how they could've ended their lives within a status being known for something they did they disappear without people knowing who they really were. To any beginning drivers that are by themselves in the car without adult or guardian supervision pay attention especially late hours 8 Pm-4Am where you can't see that well outside use your taillights and headlights use turning signals when turning left or right or even merging in the lanes use your stopping signals when your about to make a stop at a red light and please put down the phones anyone who is texting and driving can wait till you get to your devastation safely.
