I personally think it a waste of technology. As the author mentioned "You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face" and thats true, we can tell by the looks on they're faces. I think technology already has taken over so much in our daily lives. I dont think we need technology to determine what the people close to us feels. I think this technology is a waste because we humans can already tell how someone is feeling, as long as we pay attention. The article mentions the difference of faking a smile, and sincerly smiling, i don't think we need a technology to tell us weather it's fake or not. Also as it says in the article "your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile". Our home computers cant be used for this, so whats the point?

I think it is very impressive how the technology can tell the percentages of the emotions. Thats something we humans cannot do. Human can read one emotion, and that emotion would be the highest percentage of that person's emotion. The article mentions that scientists are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. It is definitly impressive but i also think it's useless and a waste.

Why do humans, and computers have to communicate? On paragraph (2) it asks if we can actually calculate human emotions like math homework. I dont think we should be able to, human emotions shouldnt be calculated like math questions.

My opinion on this artical is that this technology is useless and awaste of time. I think the world needs to focus on reconnecting, instead of building robots that can read your loved one's expression, as if you can't. It also can not be activated on your home PC. What if the technology malfuntions? technologys can't be relied on forever. I dont think this technology is valuable.
