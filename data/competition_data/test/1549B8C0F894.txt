The author explains why studying Venus is an important thing by stating the facts about how it is beneficial to us to study our sister planet. Do to to our current limit in technology and the harsh ecosystem on Venus, it is is extremely hard for us to find out any information about this planet. Many people wonder why scientist still try to find out more information about Venus. The reason is that Venus's ecosystem could have been similar to ours many years ago. Since the planet shows signs of mountains, valleys and craters we can safley assume their was once an ocean on the now uninhabitable planet. Many scientist believe that we can safley hover above Venus's atomsphere to get a better look at it. However other scientist state that they want to go on to the planet to take samples of rock, gas ect. Either way going to Venus will not be happening anytime soon.
