Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard about your idea for community service and I wanted to write to you about your idea. Well TEACHER_NAME i don't think you should have everyone take community service I think it should be only the people that want to the reason for this is..

A lot of students might not have time for community service because they might have other actives to do like dancing, boxing, swimming etc. I feel like the way we should go by this is choice if students want to take community service then great but they shouldn't be forced because some people might have other things to do and lets say community service counted on there grade and they were not able to make it there grade will go down and they wouldn't be able to get the requirements they need.

Also what if some parents wouldn't like the fact that there kids would have to do community service that would be a problem to because, lets say some parents go to work and they have a little daughter or son and there oldest will be taking care of them after school, because they can not afford a baby sitter for now and then all of a sudden all of the students have to do community service it wouldn't be fair. Parents would have to risk there job or suffer.

I also believe that students that get in trouble should get community service for a good amount of time so they understand what they did wrong, lets say someone got into a fight with another student well then the one that was held responsible for the fight should get community service because I know some students don't like having that because they think its boring so its a punishment for them. This is what I believe is right hope you take it in consideration.

Thank you

In advance,
