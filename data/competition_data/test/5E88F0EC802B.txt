Dear Mrs. Principle,

I believe that you should allow kids to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch and free time , because if something bad is going on don't you think you or the police should know about it. And if you let kids use their phones during lunch and free time they will be less tempted to text in class because they are already done. Kids also will get higher grades if they pay attention in class when they already got their texting out. I can see how you feel about cell phones and you probably don't really want kids to use them at all, but it is probably better for all of the students if they use there phones when they know they 're allowed then when they are scared and stressing that they might get caught. Also if a kid is caught they will be focused on getting it back, who they were texting/calling, or how much trouble they will get in when they get home, but not their schoolwork.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
