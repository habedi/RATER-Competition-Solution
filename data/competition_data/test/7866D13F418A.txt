Phones and driving

Do you think it is worth it to look at your phone while driving? The zebra conducted a national survey of young drivers to determine their perception of texting and driving. 36% of respondents aged 18-24 admitted to texting while driving. Using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should never be done.

One reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you could put yourself at risk of injuring yourself or someone else. Say your driving and you hear your phone's notifications going off you feel the urge to pick up your phone just to see what it is out of curiosity and you Know you shouldn't pick up your phone because you are driving but you still pick it up anyway. That one moment you look up to see a person crossing the street and are lucky enough to press your foot on the brakes in time to stop in the intersection. Consider yourself lucky as you could've injured that person. Things like this can happen which is why you should be more careful when driving.

Second reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you should consider who your riding with whether it be a friend or group of friends or maybe family members you wouldn't want to risk their lives and yours only because you grabbed your phone to look at for a few seconds. You should think twice before reaching for that phone and think about what you do. If they say don't use your phone listen to them and don't think about it focus your eyes on the road. It is not worth all the trouble.

Finally, the third reason you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is it is probably illegal. Almost all the states including some without cellphone prohibit text messaging while driving. In most of these states, you can be pulled over and cited for texting as a primary offense. When on the road be careful what you do and don't think about grabbing your phone even if it's just for a few seconds.

Overall, you should never use your phone while operating a vehicle because it is very dangerous. Remember you could risk injuring yourself or someone else. Consider who your driving with and it is probably illegal depending on the situation.
