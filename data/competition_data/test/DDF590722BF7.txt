Planning school events and projects could be fun, for example; pep rallies, concerts, and fundraisers. With the help of students the school could get a lot done and make a good reputation for their school. When the school needs help thinking of something students could help them accomplish what they need. Younger people can have a wide range of thoughts and any of them could be useful.
