Dear Principal,

I am against your conclusion of having students that have a grade B average only play sports or other activities. Some students probably might not take school work very seriously because their is probably no fun in school. And some other students look at this in a different way. They might think that sports are the motivation to get that grade B average.

If you let student with lower than grade B average participate in sports and other activities, then they might put in the effort to making the B average. They might actually take it seriously, because if they like playing sports and activities than they will do their best to stay on the team and do good in school. Some of the students might be slacking of because they are not in sports and are wanting to prove that they can do both.

Sports and other activities can be a way to improve the school percentage of exceptional students. That doesn't mean that none of the schools students are unexceptional, it means that this school would maybe be at, or stay, at a higher percentage.

This can also mean that the students can be the complete opposite if what this letter is saying. Students can slack off even more if sports and activities are added. Students grades would become even lower, and they might make sports their main thing st school. Activities is maybe not a big threat to some students. And maybe they are. People will try their hardest when they have the things that they need to do so. They would stay focus and on task if the have motivation.

Activities and sports is a big motivation to some people. If you want this school to stay a top school than sports and activities should not be only for certain students. And sometimes you will probably not have enough students playing sports and that means no games and no school sports and activities reputation.

Sometimes the best way for people to get better and something is to give them a motivation, or something that keeps them focused. If you want people to improve, you'll probably have to give them something that can help them do just that.

Sincerely,
