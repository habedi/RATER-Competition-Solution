Driverless cars are not a good idea. They are just another way to end up having more fatalities each year. People can barely drive cars now, so how is it that having a robot drive them will make our lives any better? We already have taxis, which gives people jobs. If we invested in driverless cars, that would just rid people of their jobs. Here are a few other reasons why driverless cars are not a good idea.

First off, the cars are not even truly driverless. In paragraph 2, it says that Google has cars that alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. What if the passenger fell asleep, trusting that the car would do its job? There are many things that could go wrong in a situation like that. I would not trust that it would end well.

Second, they might put cameras in the car, stated in paragraph 7. I do not know about anyone else, but I would not want someone watching me the whole time I was driving. That is an invasion of privacy and should be illegal.

Finally, the technology could clearly fail, which is said in paragraph 9. Innocent passengers who are riding in the vehicle could be mistakenly blamed for an accident and would wrongly be responsible for something they did not do.

In conclusion, driverless cars are just a bad idea. They would put people out of a job, and they are not fully self-driven. They will invade your privacy and could cost you a lot of money if you are blamed for an accident.
