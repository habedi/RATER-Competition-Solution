I think that the summer project should be student-designed. A big reason as to why it should be student-designed is the students should be able to understand the project without needing help from the students teacher. They won't have their teachers at home. If the project was teacher-designed it most likely would'nt make sense to a majority amount of the students. Regardless either its student-designed or teacher-designed they should be able to learn something from it.

Teachers assign projects for classes that they know they're going to need to remember certain material. My freshman history teacher had assigned a packet for a class I was taking the next year (AP human geography). Not many students had done it due to the fact that it was very complex and very teacher-designed. There was a lack of motivation because, students didnt find much interest. Most teachers dont think that,that effects a students work effort. Having a student-designed project makes students understand it more, have motivation to do it, and also, have it complete on time.

Everything students have done throughout the whole year had been teacher-designed, having one project during their summer student-designed would really motivate them to do their best and take their time onto doing their best. As a student I say this because,to me this is true. I feel most motivated when I can connect to my school work. Its our project we will spend the most time with it, why not make it our own? Most students dont want to do school work during summer break, I mean who would ? but if there is no way of stopping the work from coming why not let it be a time to learn for ourselves and it the project be in our hands fully.

I think summer projects should be student-designed, give us our chance to make school work outside of school our own.
