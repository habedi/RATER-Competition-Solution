Dear principal,

I agree that we should require at least a "B" average to be eligible to take place in extracurricular activities because our grades affect us in the long run throughout life. Sports may be more important to other students because you can get a scholarship from sports, but if you don't have the grades to help you can be kicked off that college's team which would mean you would lose your scholarship. In my opinion school should come before extra activities. Without the knowledge needed from school we would be lost from our ever developing world. I also believe that people who have a "C"

as their average are not trying hard quite as hard as they could. I also understand that some people are having trouble at home but they shouldn't use that as an excuse they should attempt to get some sort of counseling. I think you will agree sincerely,
