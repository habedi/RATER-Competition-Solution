Dear Ms. Principal,

Hello. Almost everyday, us students hear of a friend or a classmate that have gotten there cell phone taken away because they had it out during lunch or in-between classes. I think that students should be able to use there cell phones during lunch and other free periods because it gives the students something to look forward to after each class. Most people have cell phones now so if you keep the same rule of no cell phones allowed, you would keep pilling up more and more complaints along with a rising number of students in detention for the use of cell phones at school.

I also think that students should be allowed to have there cell phones out during lunch and free periods because If the students needs to ask there parents to bring something to school for them, they cold just send a quick and easy text message instead of walking all the way to the office and signing out just to use a school phone to call home. I'm also sure that kids would be fine with turning there cell phones off during there classes as long as they got to use them during lunch and other free periods. I hope you consider changing the rule, thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT
