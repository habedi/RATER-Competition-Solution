Summer break is a time where all students of all ages long to enjoy the warm weather and the absence of school work.

Although for some schools the absence of work during the summer is not the case. An essential part of the education process is to broaden horizons on topics that we aren't familiar with.

Which is why requiring students to participate in summer projects is an excellent objective to strengthen young minds for the upcoming year's curriculum. Ultimately, a teacher-designed summer project would be the best initiative to strengthen knowledge on a particular subject and overall grant a higher success rate.

A teacher-designed summer project would go as smooth as the driven snow.

A highly educated teacher with either a Bachelor's or Master's degree in education would fully know the required curriculum despite, which grade level is in question.

A teacher-designed project would also take out any stress and anxiety that a student-designed project could have; however, with stress and anxiety present a student-designed project could potentially lead to mental health issues.

Children in today's society deal with enough heartache and pain that most of us couldn't even bare to imagine.

Therefore, a teacher-designed student project would be the best decision to positively impact learning and preserve our children as long as we can.

Opponents may argue that a student-designed project would give students a way to be more independent, as well as, responsible.

They feel that a student-designed project is the best alternative and rebuff the consequences that might follow.

However, a teacher-designed project removes all burden that a student-designed project could offer.

It gives students the opportunity to still be kids and to enjoy their summer break without the hassle of trying to ponder on any such topic.

Therefore, the argument is perishable due to the amount of heartache and potential stress that a student-designed project could adhere to; which, is not the objective.

A teacher-designed project is a way to increase student learning and to keep young minds alive during the summer months.

Thankfully, a teacher-designed student project would take out any detrimental mental health issues that could lead to disastrous affects. Our children today are faced with more trials and tribulations rather than triumphs.

Could we at least take one less burden away?

Opponents argue that student-designed projects lead to increased responsibility and maturity, which gives children a sense of independence.

However, children typically do not have the drive to complete school work during the off months.

Overall, a teacher-designed summer project is the best alternative because our children are only young once and one day their summer breaks will cease to an end.

Therefore, the lack of stress and anxiety can impact many but it may be one student's safe haven.
