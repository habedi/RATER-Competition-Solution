My position on driveless cars? i kind of like the idea of a car taking you to your everyday destination. i mean a future where these driveless cars could form into a public transport taxi system is amazing. the google cofounder sergey brin believes these cars would offer more flexiblilty than a bus. we humans could be using less fuel then today's vehicles.

I seen these "driveless cars" in movies and televison but, now drivless cars can become are a reality. for example google has had cars that could drive by themselves independently since 2009. their cars half drove more than half a millon miles without a crash thats pretty safe in my books. also if there are trafficc issues the car automatically alerts the drive to take control for even mor safety. driveless cars are game changing.

Orignally, many futurist believed the key to developing self driving cars wasn't that much smarter then smart road way. in the 1950s General Motors created a concept car that could run on special test track. the tracks was infused with eletrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever on the front end of the car. these smart-road systems worked well. proof that these driveless cars could be a thing and a good thing. then in the 1980s automakers developed sensors for cars that could detect and respond danger. which could cause the car to apply brakes making diving safer. this alone tells us that driveless cars are the future.

In 2013, Bmw announced the delvelopment of ''Traffic Jam Assistant'' this car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph but specail touch sensor make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. but in all honesty none of these cars develop so far are nowhere driverless what means you ask they can steer, accerlerate , brake themselves but, if the human needs to take control of the wheel he or she can do the same. that means ultimate safety in my case.

Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? woullnt drivers get bored waitng for their turn to driver?

is what people who are against the idea of development for these cars might say. well dr. werner , a BMW project manger driver says "We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way." well i have some exciting information for you some manufacturer hope to do that, by bringing in-car entertainment and information sytems that use heads- up displays. an these displays could be turned off instaly if when the driver wants to take over. if you think about it these features is actuall a saftey feature in a way.

Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driving that car, which also causes problems between companys and states resulting some states to ban driveless cars.

but even if traffic laws would change for the sake of driveless cars, we would need new laws hat could cover liability in case of a accident. cause the big question is if the technology fails and someones is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufactuer?

My debate will end soon even though driveless cars are safe. automaker will continue to develop and think of new driveless cars and of the problems that are given ahead will be solved. the road to the truly autonomous cars stretches on. but i know that everday that passes we grow closer to are destination everday.
