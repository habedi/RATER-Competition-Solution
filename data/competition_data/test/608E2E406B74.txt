DEAR Principal,

I believe that we should be aloud to have cell phones in school as long as they are shut off until lunch or a free period. My reasons for say that it is a good idea to allow cell phones in school during school hours is because say that if you have an accident and are not able to get to a phone and you really hurt your self all you would have to do is pull out your cell phone turn it on and call either the office or your parents in witch if you called your parents they would end up calling the office for you to let them know what had happened and how it happened. Now if you didn't have your cell phone on you, you could end up being there for hours if no one was to come into the bathroom and then you would not want to be stuck in the bathroom for a long time. Also say that you have a doctors appointment after school and your mom did not tell you before you left the house all she would have to do is either call you and leave you a voice mail or she could just text you the time and were to meet her. Now if you weren't allowed to be able to have your cell phone how would you contact someone if you got hurt or if you had to meet your mom at the doctors and not catch the bus home or if you have to pick up your littler siblings and watch them after school. You would not be able to know that unless you have your cell phone because you can never rely on the office to pass along the message and then you could get into trouble if you do not get them message and your siblings are stuck were they are or you miss your doctors appointment. i believe that, that is the reason kids sneak them in so that they can stay in contact with their parents so that they would not get introuble. it would be a lot easier if you just let kids have their cell phone during school hours. so that they can check their messages or voice mail if mom called. now this is to why i say that you should be allowed to have cell phones in school during school hours.

Sincerely,
