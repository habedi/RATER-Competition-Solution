Humans are slowly destroying earth and scientists have not found a successful plan for us to follow. Further exploration into Venus could lead to a safe place for humans and proof that there has been other lifeforms.

Venus could quite possibly be safe for humans. If humans use a hovercraft to float above the surface, temperatures would be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. It would be hot but it would be survivable. There are also signs showing that there was oncewater; we could do a water restoration project to have waterthere again.

We have been searching for signs of lifeforms for the longest time. Venus shows signs of what we have been searching for. The planet has signs of previous oceans and has analagous features to Earth. It has rocky sediment and mountains. This could mean there was once lifeforms on Venus.

In conclusiom, further exploration of Venus could answer some of our questions. These questions having to do with the plan for when Earth finally gives up and the conspiracies of if there are other lifeforms.
