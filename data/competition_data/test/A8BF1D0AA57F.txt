Have you ever been assigned a project over a long break? Summer projects are a good way to continue the learning from the school year into the long break, but if not done right, it can lead to the students not trying or learning anything new. It's not very conventional, but if you are assigned the right thing, then it can be beneficial. I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative.

Summer projects should be student-designed because the projects should be beneficial to the individual student; not to a whole class that has different learning capacities. The students projects would be designed for specifically what they need clarification on from the previous school year. This should help the student gain knowledge of the project subject to help them succeed in the future school year. For example, if a student didn't understand human geography but was assigned a project in math, than it wouldn't help them gain knowledge for their upcoming school year; however, if a student didn't understand human geography and was assigned a human geography project, then it would help them succeed in the future. If the students designed their own summer projects then there would be a greater effect than the whole class doing the same subject project.

Students tend to learn better when they're the creator of their project and subject guidelines. Personally, I tend to work better by myself, on a subject that I need to improve my knowledge on. This gives me motivation to learn the subject where I lack knowledge, to help benefit me for my upcoming tests or even class. I asked multiple other classmates about their stance on this, and they also agree that working on something you enjoy learning about while working alone is way more beneficial than a standard summer project. It could be argued that some students don't learn when they don't have guidelines. The weakness in that is if students are given the opportunity to design their own project, then they will be able to retain the information more easily.

Allowing students to design their own summer projects would increase the creativity of the project. This would improve the experience of the student and the teacher. This improves the experience of the student because it allows them to learn and expand thier knowledge on something they like instead of a forced subject. In addition, this improves the experience for the teacher because they get to learn new things too. In addition, they won't be grading the same project for every individual person. Students that design their summer projects have the opportunity to captivate their teachers attention with an astonishing amount of information.

Summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative. Summer projects should reflect a students knowledge on a subject, not forced work.

Do you still want to have your teacher assign forced work over summer?
