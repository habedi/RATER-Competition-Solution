Many people around the world believe in the benefits of distance learning. In fact, various schools throughout the country have began to offer distance learning as an option for their students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Attending classes from home is detrimental to a student's education because of it encourages distractions, limits interactive activities, and prevents social development.

One reason distance learning is detrimental to a student's education is its encouragement of distractions. Often times a student's home is the place where they are most comfortable, but it can also be where they find the most distractions rather it's a sibling, pet, or electronic device. Students struggle to focus and obtain information when they are surrounded by a pool of distractions. Learning in a classroom provides students with a quiet, distraction-free space to learn while also providing them with the tools that they need to be successful. It is also a place where students can learn information through interactive activities.

In addition to a distracting environment, distance learning provides no hands-on activities for students which can be very detrimental to their education. Many students tend to be visual learners and benefit from interactive activities. Past studies have shown that participating in hands-on and interactive activities increases the amount of information that students are able to absorb. When working from home, students are simply working straight from a computer screen without any visual explanation for the information they are learning. This prevents students from getting the hands-on experience that is so beneficial to their educational success. A classroom with an educator allows a student to participate in hands-on activities, receive explanations, and collaborate with others.

Additionally, prevention of social development is another major reason of why distance learning should not be offered to students. When working from home, students often isolate themselves, only communicating with their educator and family. Distance learning prevents the character and social development that would normally be received in a school environment. Coming to school allows people to communicate with peers and teachers while developing a wide variety of social skills. When working with others, students are able to develop communication and leadership skills while learning how to work hard and how to be patient with their fellow peers.

Others might argue that distance learning provides students with a comfortable environment for learning. In reality, one's home is too comfortable of a place to successfully learn. Distance learning can be very detrimental to a student's education because it creates a distracting environment, disallows hands-on learning, and prevents the development of important life skills. In all, this feature of online learning should not be allowed for students because of its detriments to educational success.
