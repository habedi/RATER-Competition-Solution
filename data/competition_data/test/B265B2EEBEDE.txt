I think that for schools offering distance as an option for student to attend classes from home is not going to benefit the majority of student whom are taking this method as a way of learning. I believe the majority of student are going to disagree with this method of learning because we all know that it is going to be difficult task to learn with out a teacher who is standing by your side. Generic_Name she was a student who did attended classes from home, she explained to me how difficult was to attend classes from home because you had it to do all of the assignments that it had been gave it to you to do it alone more like homework, She also told me that sure the assignments were well explained but still it was better to have a teacher by your side. I had heard a lot of stories of students whom had failed the classes by using this method because of the difficulty to learn and concentrate at home. My old friend Generic_Name told me that in, 2010 he attended classes at home, He said that he did passed his classes with good grades but did not learn anything because what he said that he did with all of the assignments that they gave it to him was just search for the answer online and then copy and paste then send it to his teacher and that it how he had good grades but did not learn anything, at the end he told me that he did not benefit from attending classes at home.

I really do not thing that there are any benefit for student to attend classes at home instead of going to school. For example my self I would not be able to used this method to learn because I have a brother and two sisters, they go to elementary school all of them are younger than me which it means that when I am home I need to take care of them because my father and mother they come really late from their work so I am the only one who can do the task and that meas that I will not have enough time to do my school work at home. There is a guy in Generic_School, they use that program in which they let students to attend classes at home, His name is Generic_Name, he wrote an essay explaining that students were not benefit by using this method of learning at home and what he said was that so many student were arguing about this method, some of them said that they were not learning anything by them self while others said that they rather take classes at school were there was teachers and time to to there work better. I believe that even some teacher will disagree with this method, Generic_Name said that it was possible for a student to yes learn at home but it will be a difficult task to do so she recommended to go to school to get to pass your classes and learn what you need to learn.

Of course there are students whom do think that attending classes at home will really benefit them. Like my cousin Generic_Name, she is a student who does not work nor have a brother or sister so for her is really simple to concentrate on her work and learn without a teacher explaining things to her because she is really smart but that is only because she can and have the time to do it not all of the student have that. Another student from Generic_School, he graduated using this method in, 2015 he explained to us how hard it was to used this method of learning at home also he recommended student to go school isn ted of doing it at home because it would be really difficult for them. My teacher once told me that it was way better to go to school where you are going to have plenty of teachers whom are going to be there to help me, she said that it was not worth it to study at home alone.

In conclusion, I believe that school should not have the opportunity to let student to attend classes at home because of the difficulties and the struggle to learn by them self when is really simple to learn at school were there are teachers whom are going to be right there with you helping you in any was as possible and that is how you can successfully pass all of your classes with good grades.
