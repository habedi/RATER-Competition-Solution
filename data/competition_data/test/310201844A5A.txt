dear principal, do you think that our school needs to have community service? i think yes because it represents the school and more students want to go to our school. for last for the students to have a time of fun. therefore community service is important to help us in our future.

to biging with, community service represents the school because people look at us and say good kids they are the people that we need for our future not because that only also, we are helping the planet and peoples too.

secondly, more people want to come to our school why?

because of the things that we are doing to help others and that education that is in the school and programs that are in the school that helps you be the best of all.

finally, the community service the students could have more time of fun. because you have your friend there to help you and to have fun with them as you and them do the community service.
