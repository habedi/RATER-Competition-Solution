To begin with, is that reducing advantages of limiting car usages can help reduce the 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and reduce 50 percent of the gas in areas like the United States. We must lessen the space for parking so instead of stores along a distant highway you can actually just walk to the store. 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

We have to try harder to make the United states more like Vauban.

Then,

We need to get rid of cars to help get rid of pollution. Cars also causes smog, which we can get rid of if we reduced the usage of cars. Also so many cars causes congestion and a lost revenue in delivery companies. A good idea would be to fine the people like Paris did to reduce so many cars on the street.

Next,

The goal would be to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. So only buses and taxis would be permitted for the time being without any cars roaming the streets. Also any violaters will be faced a $25 dollar fine. This idea would be a really good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. We could also build bicycle paths to help travel. We could also have restrictions which could dramatically cut traffic.

Finally, if we got rid of cars it would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities. It is said that young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. It is proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.
