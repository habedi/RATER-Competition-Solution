Dear TEACHER_NAME

I'm a normal student trying to encourage you to require all the 8th grade students to go help people in need. I think that student should have at least a 100 hour in community service to graduate from middle school. I also think that it will show students how to be more responsible. It is also an opportunity to help us get ready for collage, if the school makes a program of community service and students have to help it would give us more opportunities to go to a decent university. If teachers and our parents help us to get involved in this kind of things we can get a better future and is not only for our future it is also for the next generations that will come to this school. But this is not only to benefit us it is also to benefit the people we are going to help. The community gives us a lot so i think we should give something back as a thank you. We don't want for the future generations to live in a disgusting community so we should all get together to clean up this place. But that is not all we should do we should also go to orphanages and to elementary schools and to hospitals to help. We could read to older people and teach how to read and write to orphans. Helping around the community should be a requirement to each student that is going to graduate from any school. Now as young adults we should help and not make a mess. We know what is right and what is wrong. so thank you for taking your time to read my petition and please consider this. Thank you

Sincerely
