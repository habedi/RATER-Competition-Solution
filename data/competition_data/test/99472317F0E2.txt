I feel that the author of the story "Making Mona Lisa Smile" identifiy that Facial Coding Systems enables computers to identify humans emotions becuase i feel that technology do read the students emotions and i think it is vauable because you would never know what is going on with a student if you dont know what there emotion is .

The only reason why i feel that way because i feel that if if they didnt know the emotions they wouldnt know if we are nad or sad like in the text it says " when your looking a mirrior you raise your lips at the corners of your mouth " which makes you seem mad , So i feel that if technology didnt know what our mood was then theres no point of it .

Other reasons why i think the Facial Coding System should know our emotions because when they ask a question i feel that you should show emotion in the question they ask like things like why you feel that way , when you felt that way , & when will you change your feeling about the way you feel .

In the text it says that humans perform a impressive calculatiion everyday i see that because when you say or do something the author feels that way because you wouldnt know when you read something you have emotion and that can change the way you feel about everything .
