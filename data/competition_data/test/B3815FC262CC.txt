Dear principle,

I believe in both sides of your decision, because there are many different reasons why students should be able to and shouldn't be able to participate in sports with a B average. I support your decision, in that I believe that academics come before sports. I also don't support your decision, because sports are good for students and they help them stay active and fit.

Having said that these are some more detailed reasons why they shouldn't participate in sports with a B average. I believe that school should come before sports, plus the students already have P.E. as a class to help them stay fit. I think that school is what students are graded on and that sports are just for fun. I also believe that academics are what help move your life forward, whether it is to college or medical school or even law school. I believe that education is an important piece of your life, and if you don't have an education, you can't fulfill the simplest of tasks, like shopping at a grocery store.

Though, on the other hand these are some specific reasons why they should be able to participate in sports without a B average. I think that students should have the choice to stay fit, without having to go out of their way to find a different sport to do to stay fit. For some students P.E. isn't enough to keep them fit, sometimes students need more than just a class period devoted to staying fit to be fit. I also believe that it is hard for some students to make their grade because a grade C average is average, and not all students are able to understand some concepts learned in school enough to pass to a grade B average.

For the few students who are extra hyper, they may not be able to concentrate on school long enough to actually get a B average. They might need sports to let out some of their energy, so that they can calm down during class and hype up during sports, it might allow other students to be able to concentrate on their school work instead of being distracted by someone else who isn't able to concentrate on school because of a disorder or an excess of energy.
