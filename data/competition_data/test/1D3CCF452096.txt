I think the principle is in the right because he/she is making us become more productive by having us do at least one activity.

I agree with the principle because i think humans should be more active than stay in their rooms all day. most people wont agree so the principle might need to start making incentives,lets go over some incentives.

First,you can make deals or start a point based system,for example the more activities you do the more points you get. All your points could be used for different items you might choose. I think more people will do more activities if they get a point based reward system.

Second,you can also give them school credit by every activity you do,but the credit should be in pieces,for example,if a kid does 3 activities then he gets 10 points for grade. Dont make it that all the students can is do activities and get an A,it should be like two activities = 10 points etc.

Finally,the school should have a student of the month type of thing,were whoever has the most activities done gets to be the student of the month while also having some benefits. There should int be any repeats so it can be fair and not just one kid can be the student of the month for 3 months straight.

In conclusion,school could be more active if they have a a lot of things to choose from,it could single handily save the schools reputation.
