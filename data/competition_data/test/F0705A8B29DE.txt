Dear Principal,

I think not letting students participate in sports and activities if they don't have a grade B average is a wonderful idea.

Even though most students at our school have a C average, this could benefit them.

For one thing, it would encourage them to improve their grades so that they can participate in the sport or activity that they want to.

Also, this prevents sports teams from having students who have an "I can't" attitude on the team.

Students would also be able to concentrate more on their sport or activity because they would be doing well in school.

School should always come first, which is exactly why i think your idea is perfect.

This way your not asking the students to get perfect grades, but instead to try their best and achieve a B average.

I think that this policy change could work very well for our school if you decide to follow through with it.

The students will thank you for it in the long run.

From Your Student,
