Leonardo Da Vinci's renaissance painting "Mona Lisa" is one of the famous painting this world has ever known. But there was one question in my mind,"WHAT IS HER EMOTION"? Is she smiling, is she angry, is she sad, what is her emotion.

Now this new technology called FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) can measure human emotions. It also measures Mona Lisa's emotion. Is it valuable in today's world.

Nowdays, unlimited machines have been built to comfort human civilization. Some of them really benefitted, some of not. Now a Human emotion telling machine is built to measure emotions. I think it is valuable because the creator might have built it for purpose. But what I personally think, "IT IS USELESS". WHY?.Let me explain you.

Humans are making new machines. But who has the time to test it. Because machines are growing, but the civilization is busy. Some people can't give their family some time because they got job to do. If they're done with job, then they have to look for home. Stress increases these days.

I think this machine is valuable same as useless. Valuable because it takes a lot of time and years to make. Useless because it has no role to deal with human stress, it reads emotions, that's pretty cool. But what anout dealing with stress. I hope you like my thought.
