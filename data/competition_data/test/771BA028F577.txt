I would strongly disagree with the use of this new tecnology to read students emothions in the classroom is invaluabe. Schools adding this new technology is a waste of money and time, Many parrents and students would agree that there are many other things that schools need to foucus on and implamenting new things to such as extra curricular activeaties, and sports to keep students fit and healthy. Although This new technology could reconize when a student is becomeing confused or bored in the classroom, The creators predict that is could modify the lessen, the most easyest and affecting way to modify a lesen is to make it fun or realtable to the students or haveing a effective human instructor which would be way easer than to implament this new technology. Adding this new device in a classroom full of students would be a vary bad idea many students and parrents would feel that this is an invasion of privacy.

These are my reasons why useing this new technology in the classroom would be vary invalube as a student i feel this new idea in the class rom is vary invaluble.
