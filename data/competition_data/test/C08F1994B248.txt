Offering distance learning can be extremely beneficial, depending on the child. Some children often feel safer at home than they do in school. Often times this can be due to bullying, mental disorders, or the desire to be at home with people they can trust. Children might also benefit from having one on one conversations with their teachers. In a public school, children might be nervous or scared to ask questions, give answers, or put themselves out there when they need help. An environment that makes sure a student is comfortable, will ensure that all questions are being answered. Finally, the education provided to a student at home is no different from the material public school students are learning in a classroom. Personally, distance learning seems like the perfect choice for students who have a hard time learning in a public school environment. These children have the opportunity to obtain a personal connection with a teacher, they are still getting a good education, and are more comfortable at home than in school.

When a child does not feel safe at a public school, this can distract their ability to learn and think. Many adolescents are bullied, which can cause a variety of mental disorders. Bullying disturbs a childs thought process and mental health. Mental disorders are becoming a larger problem than ever. Children can be diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and anger issues. These problems can all stem from being in a public school. When a child is at home, they do not need to worry about the bullying as much and can focus on their school work. Being around people that make you anxious will hinder your ability to retain knowledge. All a child will think about are these people who are making them feel sad, anxious, or angry. If a student decides to learn from home, they have the chance to ignore the people or things that make them feel bad and focus on their education.

Children who are in an environment that make them feel safe can often go out of their comfort zone. Often times, students do not ask essential questions becuase they are scared of scrutiny from their fellow class mates. This can leave a gap in a students knowledge of the topic. For example, if a student is learning a subject that is tough and their questions are not being asked, true comprehension is not being obtained. Being in a one on one setting can give a child a better chance at asking essential questions. Another upside to learning from a private teacher is the personal relationship that is gained. When a teacher better understands you, they have the chance to teach the way that a child needs. In a large class room, the teacher does not get the chance to teach every student individually. All children learn differently, and some can not learn any other way. When a teacher better understands the student, they can teach the way that the student will benfit from the most. The teacher can also get to know a student on a deeper level. Having a connection with a teacher is extremely difficult in a large classroom. When a student and teacher can connect, the chances of the student being more enthusiastic about learning is higher. The students drive to exceed expectations is also higher. Being in a one on one setting gives the teacher a better chance to understand the student and what the student needs. This also gives the student the chance to better understand the expectations of them.

The children who are taught from home are also recieving the same education, if not better. The cirriculum and subject matter is the same as what they would be learning in a public school. These children also get the opportunity to take the subject at their own pace. If they need more time digging a subject into their brains, they can get extra time. This might not be the same for public school students, because all students move on together regardless of anyone getting left behind. In public school, if a child does not understand the material, there is not much time for a teacher to review a topic before they have to move on. When it is just the student and teacher, the student can ask as many questions as needed and the teacher can answer the questions that that student has. Some children are slower learners and others are fast learners. It is hard to have to follow someone elses learning style and still have to understand the material being given to you. Often times public schools have programs for the slow learners and the students who need extra help with test taking, but it is not enough. These programs at public schools can help students with test taking, but they do not ensure that the child is learning everything they need in the classroom.

The distance learning program seems like it has many positive outcomes. In contrast, I do not believe this program is for everyone. Many students benefit from being in a larger, more social environment. For the students who can not handle public schools, this program is the perfect choice. It provides each child with the chance for an equal education, while getting the extra help they might need.Â
