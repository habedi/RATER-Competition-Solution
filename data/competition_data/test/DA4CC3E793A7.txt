Dear Principal:

I STUDENT_NAME think that you should do some community service i think that it is a very nice thing to do and also to be helping others. And be a good thing even also to be role model to other little kids. Helping the community is a very nice thing to do even if their is people that criticized you and either way you could even get credits to where ever high school to go you. Showing that you are a nice and educated person.

Some people don't like to be doing community service because they say it takes time from your weekdays or that its too long and also I cant go because i have a party to go to. And so far their is many other excuses about not able to do community service. For example they are even little kids who do community service because they know they are helping other people and not just them. What they don't know or some of them do know that they could be getting credits for high school and that could really help in for what ever classes you are. But its your decision of doing the community service the choice is up to you.

But in this case me writing this letter its not my choice if we should everybody do community service. And if we do i really hope if we could be getting some credits for that would be a wonderful thing to have. That would be a good thing that every body could do for something nice. Write me back when ever you have a chance please tell me if we are gonna have. Hope if we could have it at least for a time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
