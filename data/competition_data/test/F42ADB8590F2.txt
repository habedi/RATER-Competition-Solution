Driverless cars are coming. The futuristic design is extrodinary. Using a computer and satelite to navigate its surroundings. This computer has multiple sensors around the car for different things. For one thing, I am for the cars of the future.

Reason one is because they can navigate traffic jams so you don't even have to worry bout them. One bad this though is they arent completely driverless because the drive has to remain aware in case of road work or an accident where the AI of the car would not be able to compute this at the given time.

Reason two is the functionality of it. It will save our air and reduce the consumption of gas used by taxis. Public transportation will be a thing of the past if these cars are used.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be a great benefit to everyone. The envvironment would benefit the most because of the fuel reduction and the air would be a little bit cleaner. There would be less accidents due to texting and driving. All in all, driverless cars are great and the laws need to see that.
