Dear state senator,

Hello my name is PROPER_NAME and I am writing to you about our voting system. Many individuals are not content with the Electoral College and many are. You could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. Here are a few reasons on why the Electoral College method is the way to go.

During election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a "tie". A tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. In the Electoral College system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. Yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. As stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the wnning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote. It is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.

Article three line twenty-two reads " The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.". One example of this is in 1968 Nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the Electoral College. Another example is in 1992 when Clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the Electoral College. Source three line twenty-three states " It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state..". This is true but the Electoral College is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.

The Electoral College eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. The winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. The case in the popular vote method is very different.

Over all you can see that the Electoral College method is the way to go. There are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. There are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids run-off elections. We should not switch to the popular vote method.
