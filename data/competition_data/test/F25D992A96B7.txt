I think it will be ok because it will be cool to see other painting emotional. Then people can know how she was during the painting. In classroom it could be ok but i think some students wont like it . Some students might not want what emotional there feeling that day but some would liek it. I will be ok with it. Also it will also be cool it painting a drawing then see it emotional.

They did this in Unversity of Amsterdam with Dr. Huang they developoing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. They use 3-D computer model of the face. It will show every emotional u are feeling when u are there. It called Facial Action Coding System or FACS. The facial expressions for each emotion are universeal. Humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day.

In conclusion it will be a good class to be in and will be fun. They should make a class for it so other students can see the new technolgy. Dr. Hung is smart for making this and the other people that help him. I would like to help him with the project that he did . The FACS will be good for every one that want to see his emotion.
