Summer projects are a great way to keep your brain fresh during that long period off of school. Some schools require it while others do not. It is called summer break for a reason, it is supposed to be a student's time off, away from school and the rigorous learning schedule. But, some teachers give students difficult, tedious summer projects. How can a student enjoy their summer break when they have to think about the 1000 word book report their teacher assigned them over the summer? It is cruel and unfair, students should be allowed to design their own summer projects. They should have fun with it and want to look forward to completing it over the summer. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will make the project more interesting, It will give the students more motivation to complete, and it will not be as challenging for students.

While a student-designed project may be more fun or relaxed it is not beneficial to their learning. Many experts believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. The objective of a summer project is to keep the students brain fresh and continue their learning during summer break. A teacher has all the right tools and knows what is best for a student. A teacher-designed project will be beneficial for students and actually challenge them. Students receive 3 months out of school, the least they can do is one project. Teacher-designed projects give the students more initiative and responsibility, benefiting the students.

Having the freedom to design their own project, students can make it about whatever they want and do whatever they want within the guidelines. Student can make their projects more appealing to them, and make it so they look forward to completing them. When students are choosing their topic they can choose whatever they like the most and whatever they have the most knowledge about, making the project easier for them. The best part about a student-designer project is they will be able to enjoy doing their project and have fun as well. When learning is fun it is easier to complete, It wont even feel like they are doing a tedious summer project, more like a fun experiment. This will motivate them to complete their project.

Since students are designing their own projects they will be more motivated to complete it. If they are designing it themselves they are not going to choose something that they dont like or a topic that will bore them. They are making a project that they want to do and will have fun doing it. Most teachers put summer projects in next years grade bookÂ or add it as extra credit, that just provides more incentive and motivation for the students to complete their projects to the best of their ability. Since students are designing their own project they won't be discouraged by a hard assignment assigned by their teacher, instead, they will look forward to a fun easier project that they came up with and created themselves.

It is called summer break for a reason. A break off school, a break from the tedious, rigorous schedule everyday, a break from tests and quizzes. If a teacher assigns a hard summer project that only adds on to school, it doesn't give you a break. When students design their own projects they are giving themselves a more relaxed, fun, and easier project. Something that they look forward to doing. Students don't look forward to completing a reading assignment or book report, that takes away from their summer. Summer is supposed to be relaxed and the best time of a student's life. They are supposed to be making lifetime memories, not worry about a book report. So when students are designing their own projects they take all this in to create a fun project that wont be so challenging where they can enjoy their summer. They choose a project that they will enjoy doing and something that they already have prior knowledge in to make it easier. Some students may choose to do a project about something they have no clue about because they love to learn new things. A student designed project will be much easier for students and wont be as stressful.

In Conclusion student-designed projects are more effective and beneficial. Students can choose their own topic making their projects more interesting and fun for them. Students wont be discouraged by hard, challenging projects assigned by their teachers, instead, they will be more motivated to do their project because it is on something that they designed for themselves.
