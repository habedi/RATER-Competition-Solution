All students should be required to join a after school club or activity. Being a part of an extracurricular activite will promote the well being of the students. Student should be required to join after school activites because it will help them become more succesful, it is an oppertunity for students for students to make new friends, and joining extracurricular activites will help students learn to manage there time.

Participating in after school activites will help students become more succesful. Studys have found that students who participate in after school activites are 58 percent more likley to make A-B honor roll. If all students joined activites and clubs then the majority of students would preform better. A local University found that students who joined clubs were less stressed. Joining clubs and acivites would help reduce the students stress levels. There are some clubs that students can join where teachers can help students with any work they do not understand. Most teachers stay after school at least once a week. I think that if all students joined clubs then students would be more likely to get better grades, have reduced stress, and get extra help.

Joining clubs and other activites is a great way for students make new friends and do activites with there friends. Being a member of a club would allow students to meet new people in our school. Joining a club would give students a chance for them to talk to kids that are not in there classes. Students can sign up for clubs and acivites with there friends. Many students don't have classes with there friends, extracurricular activites would allow them to spend time with eachother. In some after school activites students students can work together to complete work that they dont undestand. In after school clubs students could help eachother. Joining clubs would give students a chance to make new friends, spend time with there friends, and give students a chance to work together.

Some students may be busy doing other things out of school. Some students may visit familly or take care of a younger sibling after school. However I belive that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. If all students joined extracurricular activites then it would help them learn to manage there time better and at a young age. Joining an extracuricular would help students manage there time bettwen school, extracurriculars, and there personal lives.

If all students participate in extracurricular activites then students would be more sucessful, give them the oppertunity to be with there friends and make new friends, and help students manage there time. There are also many clubs and activites students can participate in. I strongly belive that it is in all of the students best intrests, to require students to participate in extracurricular activites.Â
