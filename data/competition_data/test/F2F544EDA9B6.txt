Senator of Florida

Im sending you this letter to address you on that i am in favor for keeping the Electoral College. Having the reason being that, this process will be in a much acelerating rate of speed and less of a process to go thruogh. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This entire process consits of the selection of thr electors, A meeting of electors sit and vote for the president and also vice president. This in my opinion is the best way on to vote for the president.

The Electoral Eollege consits of 538 electors. Our state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its congressional delegation. One for each member in the House of Representatives and an additional two for the senators. This will allow better flow of votes around the House of Representatives. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, District of Columbia is further more allocated 3 of the electors and is to be treated as if they were one of the state. For the purposes of the Electoral College, the reason for the word "state" does refers to District of Columbia.

Every candidate running for the president in the state does has his/hers own group of electors. These electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political parties. This gives the Electoral College a better way of choosing electors for the party. Just like every presidential election, they will all, take place every four years on the tuesday after the first monday of November. I my self as a well and loyal citizen and resident of Florida can also choose the states electors when i go and vote for president. Because when i do vote for my candidate i am voting for my candidate's electors.

Almost every state has a "winner-take-all" system, this will reward all electors to the winning presidential candidate. This one of the main reasons i do take in favor the Electoral College as a way to vote for the president. And then after the presidential election is done, the governor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment". Then by it listing the ever single one of the candidates who has ran for president in the state of Florida. Along with the names of their respective electors who has been on their side during the whole process.

Then here by saying all i needed to say about the Electoral College and what has been brought to my attention of details of the Electoral College. Hopefully, some others will take notice for what i have sated here before you. They will to soon realize what in great inportance this is to you and many others to come for. Hope you have good day and a very well sleep tonight and my sincearest thanks for you being able to take the time and read the letter.
