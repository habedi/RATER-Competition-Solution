Summer is mostly a time for kids to relax and wind down from the stress that school causes. Summer projects can seem like a burden but in reality they are very beneficial. Nevertheless summer projects should be given out to insure that kids dont fall behind when they go back to school in the fall and so that the transition from summer to school is much easier for the kids and teachers. Summer projects should be teacher-designed for the reasons that they know what will be thought in the upcoming year and they will also challenge kids to do their best work.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to them knowing what the curriculum demands them to teach. Kids have minimal to no idea of what they will learn in the upcoming year but teachers on the other hand are given an overview of what the kids should learn throughout the school year. So it seams very foolish to let a kid make up their own project without them knowing what is expected of them. A kid can not magically know what they need to do their project on. They might be able to design the project but in reality they could just be wasting their time doing a project that has nothing to do with what they will learn in the upcoming year. It is not beneficiary for the kids to work on a project that has nothing to do with what they will learn in school. It also dose not benefit the teacher considering that the kids will walk into class not knowing a thing. The teacher will have to wast time introducing the subjects, where if the teacher would have designed the project that would not be needed.

Another reason why summer projects should be designed by teachers is due to the fact that they will challenge their kids in doing the best work possible. Teachers wont cut corners when it comes to teaching and informing the future of this world because thats their passion. Teachers know how important it is that kids constantly practice and or learn new things throughout the summer. If they dont it is very likely that the kids will not retain all the information they learned from the perverse school year. That could cause a slow start to the year due to the teacher having to refresh the kids on some subjects. Teachers wont create summer projects that only take a couple of minutes to complete, but instead give projects that will have the kids doing the project in little sections throughout the summer. This would result in the kids coming up with a system which would not only help them prioritize their time but also have them consistently doing school work.

While some may say that summer projects should be student-designed, that is not the case. If kids where able to design there own summer projects it would be highly unlikely that they would make something that challenges them. Kids are not focused on spending there time creating a challenging project for school; on the contrary, kids just want to have the best possible summer. There would be no structure whatsoever leaving the kids to make all the decision. They would chose easy topics that would only take a couple of minutes to complete. Due to that they would be self compromising their opportunity to really show what kind of good work they can truly do.

It seems very clear that summer projects should not be student-designed but teacher-designed. Teachers know exactly what the kids should practice and learn during the summer so that they are prepared to have a smooth transition for playing outside with their friends to learning in the classroom. It would also prevent kids from taking the easy way out and designing a project that would take a couple of minute to complete. On top of that they would also be hurting the teacher, classmates, and themselves in the fact that they wont be prepared when school starts. This causes a chain of affects that in the end helps no one but hurts everyone. Summer should be a time to relax and have fun but kids should always have school in the back of there heads.
