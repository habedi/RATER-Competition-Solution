I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because they could learn about different peoples countries and needs. Also it would be once in a life time oppertunity to see different countries. It could make a difference in your life

Luke said "It made me aware of people of other countries and their needs. It was more than a adventure. In 1947 Luke made the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for small town boy

This is why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It could help you see how others are like and their problems. You would be able to see different kinds of places. It could help you become a better person by helping other people out. You would experince a lot of fun things.
