Texting and driving has become more of a problem as time goes on. With the large growth of technology use, almost everyone has access to a phone while driving. There are many reasons you should choose not to be on your phone while driving. Not only is it extremely dangerous for yourself but also anyone else on the road. It's something that should be taken very seriously. You should not be able to use a cell phone in any way while operating a vehicle, and if caught should result in punishment.

Texting and driving is a huge problem in day to day life. As people get too comfortable driving the more it starts to happen. People think they can get away with it which isn't always the case. Driving a vehicle is something that might seem easy if you have been driving for a long time, but is still a very dangerous task. It's something that requires your undivided attention no matter how long you've been doing it. Not only are you putting yourself at risk of harm but also everyone else on the road.

The National Safety Council says that using a phone while driving results in 1.6 million crashes each year. With 390,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. 1 out of 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. This is even more dangerous than being under the influence of alcohol when driving. There are punishments in place to help prevent people from doing this.

Laws on texting and driving vary by state. In Georgia if you are caught you're faced with a $50 fine with a point on your license for first offense. $100 for the second time and two points. $150 for the third time and 3 points. This can lead to your license being suspended if you have accumulated 15 points (4 if under the age of 21). These are just the lesser punishments, if you get in a wreck while on your phone it can become much worse with up to a year in jail time.

With these consequences and taking the risk of putting yourself and other people in harm's way isn't worth being on your phone. It's better to just wait until you're not driving. And as this issue continues to rise more and more it's important to be careful and watch out for other people that might be distracted on their phone while driving.
