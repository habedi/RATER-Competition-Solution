Dear Principal,

We students love our sports! Just because we may drop below a B every so often doesn't mean we should not get to play our sports. For some of us it may not be the sports that are making our grades drop. It could be that some of us just need a little tutoring or a little help in the subject. Also, many students parents put in a lot of money so their children can play that sport.

So you could have a lot of angry parents wondering why there child could not play their sport when they have a 79 average in math for their report card. There is also another problem if the child gets kicked out of the sport because other children on that team rely on them to play their part. Other children may not automatically step up to fill the position. Also, when you do this you are depriving children of their excersise which is very important to growing teens like myself .So you see? There are very good reasons why this shouldn't happen. Please, take this into consideration.

yours truly,
