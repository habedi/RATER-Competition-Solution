The Seagoing Cowboys are boys are poeple who help others out. When countries fall they're there to pick them right back up. There are three reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. The reasons are one its a good way to help out others, two its a good opportunity to see the world, and three you are litterally saving people lifes and dont even know it yet.

Reason one is becasue the job is just a really nice way to help out those around you. You can help the enviroment by replacing animals and even buildings. You help out the poeple that werent as lucky as you. Some people could be suffering out there in the cold, but you helped them rebuild their houses,and rebuild their lifes. Poeple will be greatful for your kindness.

Another thing i noticed was that It gives you a good oddortunity to see the world. Luke

Got to see a bunch of beatiful things on his way to other countries. He Got to see things from New Orleans. To China. He got to see things you wouldnt normaly see just going through your normal life. You have the chance to see stunning things if you were a Seagoing Cowboy.

Last but not least. The Last thing i noticed was that you are litterally saving poeple's life. Poeple could be out their starving and you could be the one to fix it. Some poeple would rather just care for their own family, but you have to power to give poeple food. They will have homes to sleep in becasue of you. Poeple will be snuggled in beds at night becasue you choose or not if you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Some poeple may think that it would take away their time, but what are you really losing. All your doing is helping poeple out? Is that not enough? u
