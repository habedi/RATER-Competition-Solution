When Luke first started the program he thought it was a opportunity of a lifetime. He knew it would be a good thing for a small-town boy like him. He wanted to be able to help out others and that program was an awesome way to do so.

He got to spend time with animals, got to play games occasionally, got to be helpful, got to see amazing sights, and got to see his friends. The program was an awesome way to do a lot of things. One example is how Luke got to tour an excavated castle in Crete. He also got to see Europe and China. That is unbelievable opportunity for a boy like him. Luke got to have fun by playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be an awesome adventure. A quote straight from Luke was,"I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." Another quote from Luke was,"The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special." That proves that even if you had to work you were still having the best time ever. The job as a Seagoing Cowboy is more than just hard work, and being miserable. You actually get to enjoy your time.

If you want to have a great job I'm sure all the Seagoing Cowboys will agree that you should be one of them. Yes, you do have to work hard, but that isn't a reason you shouldn't join. How many other jobs do you get to see amazing sights, or play volleyball and other games. As a Seagoing Cowboy you even get to help people out with their country and their needs. This is why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy, and I'm sure Luke agrees ,too.
