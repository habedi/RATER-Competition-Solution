Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to my attention that you are considering a new cell phone policy. From the two you are choosing of I think that it would be in the best interest of the students to allow them to bring their cell phones but only to use them at lunch or free periods. The reason being is that at lunch time the students would be able to text or call their friends without disrupting any classes. Second is that students need their phones in case of an emergency. If they forgot to tell their parents to pick them up early that day then they would be able to call them to tell them.

Also I think that if you banned cell phones you would have an even bigger problem than before because knowing that they would get into trouble the students would use their phones in class very discretely so that the teacher wouldn't see. So if students follow the cell phone policy that they are allowed to bring it but only when allowed, I think that the students will be happy, the parents will be happy, an you will also be happy.
