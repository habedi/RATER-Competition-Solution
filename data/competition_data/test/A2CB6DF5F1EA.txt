using technology like facial readingd to see what a student is feelingsin the classroom is a big step in history. i think its a fantastic idea. sometimes we humans casnt tell the difference friom a ginune or facke emotion. this computer system bybasses all of that and gets right down to business and tells us whats real and whats fake. using this new technology is a need for schools. i sometimes lie about not needing help or if im stuggling with a problem i normally skip over it or not ask for help. these facial readers reduce let the teachers know how i would be feelings and they could come to me and ask if i needed anything. the sarticle states that is the computer could tell how the student was feeling it could help the student learn by switching up problems and making it a better learning experience for the student. it could read the emotkons if studfents when they are having a tough time during a problem or when they are doing well with the emotions it reads.

the technology would benefit students because when they need help the technology either helps the teacher know whats wrong or helps the student with a better and more accurate learning experience.
