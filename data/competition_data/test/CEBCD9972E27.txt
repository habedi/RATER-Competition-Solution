The amount of extracurricular activities is endless ranging from sports to just reading a book. Interest plays a key role when doing something. If someone is not interested in something, then they will most likely not pay attention, and just not care about the matter at hand. It is not just interest, other factors play a key role as well. For example, the pressure. Pressure can be very high when trying to pick the best extracurricular activity. That is the position that this principal is is putting everyone in. Putting together what I have just said, I do not support having kids pick out an extracurricular activity against their will because, the principal has no right to force everyone into doing it, it is unfair to the kids, and the pressure is too high.

The first reason I would like to point out is that the principal has no right to force everyone into signing up for an extracurricular course. Forcing someone to do something against their own will is wrong. Forcing someone means telling them that they have to do it no matter what they do against it. They have no choice. By forcing someone, the principal is taking away the kids' right to say, "No." The kids do not have a choice but to agree to these terms.

My second reason is that it is unfair to the kids. It is unfair because some kids might not like any of the activities that interests them. They might not even want to sign up. It is unfair because the principal is basically choosing the activities for them. They are limiting the activities to a certain amount. It is unfair because of the principal's choices he is making for everyone. Additionally, they are making everyone's choices harder because the kids want to be with their friends.

My last reason is that the pressure it too high. When someone is picking something, whether it be for a college, or in this case an extracurricular activity, the pressure can be to high for someone. Pressure can dismount someone's focus and train of thought. The principal is building up everyone's pressure by making them pick something not good for them, or just not in their fields of interest. The kids just want to be with their friends and be happy. If they get lucky and get in with their friends, then maybe that will relieve a bit of their stress.

In conclusion, No one should force anyone to do anything against their own will. Instead they should think about their needs and wants, and choose what activity would be best for them. Instead of forcing, you should consider what their personality is, and what category they would best fit in. I do not support having kids pick out an extracurricular activity against their own will because, the principal has no right to force everyone into doing it, it is unfair, and the pressure is too high.Â
