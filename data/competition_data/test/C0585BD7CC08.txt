Some people say that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be a dull job.

What is a Seagoing Cowboy you ask, well it is a person who delivers cattle to people in need.

It was World War 2 and people around the world needed help with ways to get food.

I felt like I could do something for them, so I decided to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you feel that way then I encourage you to join the Sea Cowboys.

There were many reasons why joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a cool thing and here is one.

For the experinces!

I was a small town boy and had not got to see a lot of the big world that we live in.

The sign up sheet said we would not only help the people in need we would also get to see some of the amazing sights in that country.

That was no lie!

On my journeys I saw the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and a recently excavated castle in Crete.

I also got to ride in a gondola in Venice, Italy.

Another thing that not many people could say is that you crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice.

Another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you have a chance to serve your country without killing another person.

On my first trip as a Seagoing Cowboy, I turned 18. That is when you are old enough to be drafted to the army.

When the draft board found out I was being a Seagoing Cowboy, they told me to do that as my service.

If you don't like the thought of shooting people, then maybe you could be a Seagoing Cowboy. You would help people get food, not have to shoot anybody, and serve your country.

Now you know some reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

I hope to see you aboard soon.
