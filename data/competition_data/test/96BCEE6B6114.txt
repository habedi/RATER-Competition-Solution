Dear principal,

Did you know that 50% of community service around the world actually benefits the environment. That means cleaner learning environments, we would be helping out the community, and most importantly a better education. I know that if we got everyone in the school to help around with community service we would not only have great learning environments but be great academically.

I always here the principal saying, " Excuse me can you pick that up!" I know it gets really tiring and you waste a lot of energy. However if you get community service the environments will be squeaky clean, and you'll save a lot of energy. i also know how the country is in a recession now and we need money for school so with community service we'll saving lots of money.

Education, the one thing that America is really lacking today. Sadly to say from my opinion our education system is meant for the kids to fail. (Lucky for the teachers TEACHER_NAME. ) half the teachers aren't even qualified to teach. To greaten kids opportunity to moving on to the next grade community service will help. Test scores, grades, and their opportunity of being successful would rise through the ruff.

Lastly but not le
