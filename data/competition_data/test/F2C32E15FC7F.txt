Have you ever got made to play a sport or work on a year book and you were tired and didnt feel like doing anything your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity for example students could participate in sports or work on the year book.

I agree because your gonna have to make students do something if there not gonna do it or they choose not to do any extracurricular activity i agree that you should cause you could always try something new so u dont do the same thing over and over again.

Like if someone is tired in the mornings and they dont wanna do anything your gonna have to tell them that they are gonna have to choose one and not do anythibg in school and if they dont then its their own problem like teachers make students do stuff cause they dont want them to miss out on anything fun or is cool.

I would always agree because sports are fun and a great activity to try even if your bored and dont have anything to do like basketball, Football soccor volleyball and other sports that are fun to play you could even play with your friends if you and your friends dont have any thing to do.

Your gonna have to listen to your principal eitherway your gonna have to choose one or not have fun and your gonna have to work on the boring year book that they do mostly every year before school is out if you dont choose any then your obviously gonna get in trouble if you dont do any one and your probably wont be able to do anyyhing

Thats why i agree that you must do a extracurricular activity at school cause the principal is gonna make you and you have to listen to the principal or you would get in trouble for not doing anything at school when you have to do it.
