Dear principal,

I have choose to write you a letter about why we should have school sports. Well first off you said "That you are considering to change school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless the have at least B average". well personally you can do any sports with a GPA of 2.5. i would think that would be fair because you should know that many people are not that smart at school but really good in sports. So now i say that you should base it on a group class so in their view class you have them take a test. and in that test you say" okay this test is to see how well you do. so lets just say that there is only a couple of kids who well don't very well then you say okay since a couple of you didn't do very this is what we are going to do we are going to combine all the kids test so all 30 test and we are going to average them. Which mean every body has a good chance and then if that doesn't work. than that is when that hard parts come. so what you do then is say if you really want to do this sport than you have to work for. that means after school you have to work on that class. and get help find some one or a book that can help you. So that way you can have some good grades. So then lets just say that you do that every day. And you make it on the team. then what its going to be practice every day for the team. take the skills you learn form your after school help and use them .so that way you can go home take a shower and go study for that big test you have. but really it should be actually a C because C is average. and B is above average. so if you have a B then you should but if you have a C then you should work as hard as you can to get a B so that way you can play safe and have fun well doing what you love the most working hard and choosing the best way to success.

Well i guess you should say "what about P.E. well i guess if you have P.E. then you should have sports to. because P.E. is like a sport to. you run you do all these kinds of work out and it is just like sports. so in other words P.E. is just like sports.

Sincerely. student
