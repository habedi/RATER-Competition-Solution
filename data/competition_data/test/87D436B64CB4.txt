Dear Mr. Principal,

I am one of the eighth grade students going to your school. I'm sending this letter to you concerning about your decision of requiring the students to do community service or not. I think you should not require community service because the student might have some sport activities or some family matters that would prevent the student from fulfilling them. For example if something happens to the student like a relative passes away and the funeral is on the same day of that student's community service the student would have to choose over the community service or the funeral. If the student chooses the funeral over the community service the people he or she was supposed to help would be helpless. And if the student picks the community service over the funeral the family would think that he or she doesn't care about the deceased.

If you do decide to require students to do community service at least let them choose what day they want, so they could schedule it, so there won't be any problems with the time. Also consider allowing the students to change the date of the community service just in case something does come up.

Some pros for requiring the students to actively do community service is that the community would be joyful that there are people to help out with their day to day lives. Another pros would be that the students would hopefully feel like they did something that would benefit them and others. Some cons for requiring students to do community service would be that the students might feel that they're wasting their time in a nursing home for example and would not enjoy the day they chose.

A pro for not requiring students to do community service is that students would be able to chose if they want to help or not. This will encourage students to be themselves. A con that would result from not requiring community service would be if no student wants to do community service, there would be no one to help around the community.

I know its not my decision, but I hope I was able to convince you to make the right choice and not require community service for the students. Thank you

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
