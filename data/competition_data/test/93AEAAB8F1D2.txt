Dear Principal,

I do not think all students should have to be required to perform community service. I do not think they should have to because it takes time away from our free time, which, we don't get a lot of as it is. It would make the students unhappy, and it gives us less time to study and do homework; that the teachers already complain we don't do enough of.

The first reason scholars in our school should not have to be required to do community service because it takes away from our free time, which, we don't get a lot of already. I do think it should be given as a choice to do voluntarily, but we shouldn't have to be forced to do community service. Isn't that what it's called anyway? Volunteer work? I don't mean to be rude, but, it's not volunteer work if we're forced to do it.

Second, if you force us to execute community service, it would make a lot of the students unhappy. The student body is already full of hatred anyway (just speaking the truth), so why would you want to just make it worse? Just think, some kids getting picked on for doing community service. How would that help the school at all? Besides, the kids want to be out hanging with their friends, not stuck doing community service. The only time we have to go out with our friends is on the weekends, and our lives are already controlled by our parents. We don't need it to be controlled by the school too.

The final reason we should not have to do community service is it would give us less time to study and do our homework. The teachers already get angry when we don't do it, and they've heard every excuse in the book. Giving us community service would just add one more excuse to the list, and make teachers even angrier. It would get in the way of our study time too (yes, we still do study on our own). You want us to pass our SOLs right? But to do that we need to study, but doing community service would give us less time to study and less people would pass their SOLs.

In conclusion, I think that the kids at my school should not be forced to do community service because, it takes time away from our free time, it would make the students angry and unhappy, and it gives us less time to study and do homework. Just think back to when you were 13/14 years old. Would you have wanted to be forced to have to do community service?
