If the principal ever decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity, I would strongly disagree with that idea. After the bell rings at the end of the day, students should have the freedom to do what they wish with their extra time. I am sure that if this happens, most students would not be happy with that, including myself. It is good to have extracurricular activities outside of school, but you cannot force it upon someone. It would be a good idea to encourage it, but not to force it. I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings, students should decide what they wish to do after school, and school is already very stressful, piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal.

If this rule was ever put into place, it would take away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings. This shouldn't even be the principal's rule anyway. If this unfair rule was ever enforced, the county or someone higher up than the principal should make this decision. Most students including myself, just want to go home and talk to their friends. I am an honor roll student, play two competitive sports, and I am also in the National Junior Honors Society, and putting even more activities on my calender would be very stressful. It is not good to just be lazy and sit around all day, but the school cannot decide what to do for you after the bell has already rung. Even if this rule was enforced nationwide, I still dont think this rule would be the slightest bit fair. Making a student stay after school and do an after school club, would actually make a good punishment for a student who has done something wrong, but forcing busy, well behaved students do that would be extremely unfair. Making a student stay after school is the whole idea of after school detention, which is used as a punishment.

Students should decide to do what they wish after school. Most days of the week I have baseball, basketball, I go to the gym, and have 30-60 minutes of homework. A lot of the time, I have two of those on the same day, sometimes even three! I am not forced to do any of those activities, I choose to do them. If the student was forced to do an extracurricular activity, that would be something their parents would decide, not the principal. All of my friends including myself strongly dislike school, but most of us are on the honor roll and do other activities, not involving the school. Besides, what benefits is the principal going to get out of forcing something upon their students? When I leave school at the end of the day and finish my homework, I want to get as far as I can get from school. Most days after school, I take a few hours of down time to relax, and a few hours of non-school related activities. I am a very productive, well balanced person, and being forced to put extra activities on top of the ones I already have, would enrage me.

School is already stressful, so piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful. Being overwhelmed with school, whether you are being bullied or you are failing your classes, can lead to depression. Many cases of teen depression have to do with school. I enjoy being productive and participating in activities, but not when it comes to school. Making students do after school activities would be a very shallow-minded thing to do, given the fact that most students dislike school. It is good to encourage students to go to extracurricular activities, but not to force them. In high school I intend to be on one of my school's sports teams, but I am making that decision on my own. Besides, maybe you dont enjoy any of the after school activities. I am already forced to come to school for seven hours a day, and adding another hour or two on top of that would be very tiring and stressful. Doing extracurricular activities are great for you, but not when you are being forced. Just thinking about staying after school for an extra hour or two stresses me out.

Someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal. If this ever actually became a rule, It would be followed by more than just one school. It would either be countywide, statewide, or nationwide. I am not saying that I agree with this rule but if this was ever passed, the principal wouldnt have the power to force students to do this. The principal does not have the ability to pretty much extend our school day. That would be something decided by higher up people, like the governor, president, or board of education. The principal just enforces the rules, not creates them.

This rule would make many students angry. It wouldnt make anyone happy, because the students that want to do after school activitiess, can still do them just as easily. No one gets any benefits from this rule. Making students participate in after school activities would probably encourage students to cut class more often, and maybe just not even show up to school at all. You can be a well rounded person without having to attend after school activities. Again, I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's rights to leave after the final bell rings, students should decide what they with to do after school, piling more school related activities on top of school would be very stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal.
