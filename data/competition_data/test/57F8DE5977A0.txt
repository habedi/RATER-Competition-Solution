Cars are the automobile that we like to use because we are fat and can't just walk places. It is too much work to walk to places or even bike. So we as human beings will just keep on getting fat and destroying the world. Then we will just have to do what they did in

Interstellar and find a new planet to live on but it probably wont work because we aren't that smart because we can't figure out how to make hoverboards. The world might be less poluted if we just had hoverboards not hovercars that would be stupid. People would just drive around a mile in the air and crash and have no chance of survival. Hoverboards would get you places faster and not kill you, I mean unless you go over water then like in

Back to the Future it would stop working. Actually that would suck if it rained then you like can't go anywhere unless you can dry the ground super fa st.

Cars just are so bad that they just have to go kill the nature and kill humans. I mean airbags only do so much like getting hit by a semitruck that would probably kill you unless you are in the semitruck then it would just be a semi hitting a semi and that wouldn't be good. Now what if we just got off our lazy butts and actually didn't drive and waste our time. We can just walk to places or bike. Now if we did that then it would waste more time but we would be fit though. Also if people are fit and don't drive cars they might get dates but then they wouldn't even be able to drive their date to the movies or dinner because they don't have cars. They could just jog there but by then it would just be easier to just call for food but then by the time the food got here it would be all soggy and gross. Also it would be cold and no one likes that. So cars are good and bad because science and logic say so.
