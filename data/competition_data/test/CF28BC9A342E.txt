Most students from all around the world from all around the world don't have the ability to go to school everyday. They either live far away, their parents can't afford it, or they're just incapable of going to school. Now with today's technology, students can get their education and can get their work done from online instead of sitting in a classroom. Distant learning can be a big benefit for students because they don't have to worry about turning their work in late, they're still getting their education, and they still get their credits to graduate.

First, the students don't have to worry about turning in late work. When a student is not at school, he/she will miss a good amount of important lessons and important class work. When they come back to school, they will be a little bit behind from everyone else because the other students have moved on to the next lesson while you're trying to catch up on work and trying to learn the lessons that you weren't there for. But now we can fix that problem with using video conferencing so gthat the student can still do their work from home while the teacher can still give you the information from the video call. This can also be a stress reliever for the students because they are still caught up with the class and they don't have to worry about turning late work.

Secondly, the students are still getting their education. Many students are not able to attend school for various reasons. Which means that they are not able to learn about math, history, science, and english. With online classes, students can learn all of the main courses without going to school. For example, my brother used online classes for college because he lived for away from the college he was attending. He got all of his main courses finished for college and he only one class that he had to go to. Therefore, online classes can be a good resource for the students that are not able to attend school.

Lastly, students can stil get their credits to graduate. Students who graduated early used online classes throughout their high school years. They still recieved their credits to graduate and to go on to college. For example, a friend of mine was able to graduate early from her junior year of high school. She told me that she used a good amount of online classes during the summer so that she can stack up her credits to graduate early. I you really want to graduate or graduate early, online classes can help you recieve the credits just a bit quicker than school can.

Not all students need to use video calls or online classes to pass a class or to grauduate. But it's definetly helpful to the ones that are having trouble in the classrooms or to the ones that are not able to attend school. In conclusion, online learning can be a benefit to the students who needs with their education.
