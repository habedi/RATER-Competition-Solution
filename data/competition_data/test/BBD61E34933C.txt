First , me and my partner Christina was in the lab one day when we discovered a mask on Mars. Me and Christna thought different things about the mysterious mask on Mars. My thought was that it was just from natural landform but , Christina thought different she kept going on about how the "aliens" made the mask to tell us there living on Mars. I asked her alot of time about why she thought that and you wanna know what she always said! She said "isnt it obivious that no one else in on earth and so no one can make it". I was thinking she was crazy! Shee must of been off her rocker . Some facts from the story is that "A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation. . . which resembles a human head. . . formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth." and " Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image appeared on a JPL web site , revealing . . .

a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."

Last , what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.
