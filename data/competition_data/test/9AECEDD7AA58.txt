Driverless cars would be scary to be in. I mean think about it, your in a car, in the driver seat and let's say the car crashes. you can't do anything to prevent it from crashing because the car is in control.

In my opinion I don't really think it's a good idea to have "Driverless cars" because, what if the car mulfunctions. The car could hit another car by accident. They say it's safe, but i still wouldn't get in one. Just knowing that these cars may become apart of my future actually scares me, because i don't want someone to get hurt or have their life taken away fromthem because they couldn't do anything to stop the car.

In conclusion I think it would be safe to frop the whole "Driverless car" idea because I mean come on its rediculous. Someone can get seriously hurt if the car maulfunctions or dosn''t stop, turn or whatever when it's supposed to. How is the car supposed to know the speed limit? It;s just obvious to some people that "Driverless cars" are just a waste of time. I'm one of those people.
