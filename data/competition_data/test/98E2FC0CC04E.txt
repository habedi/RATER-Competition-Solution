Can you picture life without cars ? In today society cars are our only transporatation, well in the U.S. it is. many different places around the world are beginning to use other ways to get around from place to place. This are some reasons why cars should be limited usaged because you can save more money, you save more time, and you become more happier and less tense and stress.

To begin with, In paris people are to save more money not having cars because of smog. Smog fine citizens for even or odd numbers on their license plates. A quote from the passage states "the goal is to promote alternative transporation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines." This quote shows how citizens really feel about cars, they want more transportation outlets and to ban cars so they can save more money.

Next, Picture being stuck in traffic late to work only becuase it was probaly a car accident or maybe the road is getting constructed. A good way to avioding traffic is to use other source of transporation. It saves you more money and less time. This also improve the safety of the people beaucse fewer accident can be avioded. Most accidents happen becuase of rushing to get to work or school. for exable from the passge states" he proposed partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities in which "pedestrian", bicycle, privatecars... are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resouces, lower emissions and improve safety." I agree with this quote because it gives you reason to imporve the way me save our money and hepls make our environment safe.

Last, Study show that more people who don't have car are more happy then people who have cars. the reason that is, is because people who dont have cars don"t have to worrie about car insurance and car payments.
