The reason i think other people should join the seagoing cowboys is because. The seagoing cowboys is not just for fun. It is to help Europe and the many other countries recover from world war II.So 44 nations join together for the seagoing cowboys. Not only is this trip a adventure its an opportunity to do something good for others. So instead of sitting at home and doing nothing maybe you should come. This trip made me aware of people in other countries that are in need. This one trip will want to make you do more for the homeless and do more for people in need. It took me two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean if i can do it you can do it to. There is no reason that a short amount of people went you should have went. imagine if you were those people in Europe and the other countries i bet you would want people to come and help you. You cant be a selfish person these people fought for thier countries and whille they were fighting all they had was destroyed. A lot of people died that night what if it was your brother or sister that got shot trying to fight for their country. Thats why you should come with us to the seagoing cowboys.
