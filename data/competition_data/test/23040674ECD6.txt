Some schools require summer projects make sure that students are continue learning in their summer break. The concept of summer projects should engage the students to think critically even without a classroom setting. This would benefit the students as they will remember how to study and work ethically even with the long summer break. However, summer projects should be student-designed because student-designed projects would allow them to further invest their interests and will not bore the students during summer vacation/break.

Student-designed projects would allow the students to further invest in their interests. Allowing students to choose their topic will increase the productivity and enjoy the project. While this is not a summer project, Generic_School has a school wide project called an EOL that is similar to the concept being presented. The EOL or Exhibition of Learning is a day where students present their interests to the other students and school staff. This ranges from extracurricular activities to hobbies, and even more. Almost every single student that participated enjoyed presenting and sharing their true passion to everyone in the school. The similar concept used in Generic_School can be used during the summer in different schools to engage the students more and them to have fun and not considered it a chore. Another example are summer reading choice books. If the school or class assigned a specific book, usually the students will procrastinate until the last week. But given the choice to choose their books could spark the interest needed. Having the option to choose is very important to engage a student. However, some could argue that the project is not appropriate or seems too easy. This can be prevent with some types of requirements, basic outline, and the approval from the student's teacher. Summer projects should not be a boring task that is done near the end of the break because it just due at the start of the school.

Teacher-designed projects would bore and stress the students during the time of relaxation. Given the time of summer break, which is approximately 3 months in the standard US education system, the expectation of the project would stress out the students. The point of a summer vacation is to relax, have fun, and get ready for next year. Given the span of the time, forcing students to do something that does not interest them would cause them to continue push it till the last day. This promotes procrastination which is very unhealthy for a student as it caused a stress overload on the due date. Teaching and maintain how to do work in a reasonable time lineÂ should also be the goal. Stressing the students in the summer is not a smart idea because they are "burnt out" from the school year and need time to "heal". In real life, there is an argument that working does not give them the option to choose and are assigned to them. This is easily proven otherwise due to the fact that teacher-designed could cause them, in the future, to do the same thing they did in school, stress over it. Learning to stress and procrastinate in school can be lead onto the student's future. Allowing them to choose would stop procrastination and high stress levels and engage them to finish the project in a reasonable time setting. Also, forcing students to conduct a project on a topic they dislike is very harsh to do in the summer. As soon as they complete the rough end of the year tests, they are forced into a task with little to no interest. As anyone that went to school, being forced into something that does not interest them is very boring and they stress over it. An example of this can be found in real life as youtubers, content creators online, stress and have mental issues because the fans are requesting a video that the youtuber is not interested in. Summer vacation is thought of for teens and kids to have fun and explore not be locked in a library/room to conduct a project. Teacher designed projects are not a smart idea to engage the student during break.

Summer projects are a great idea to keep the students still engaged in school related topics. The way summer projects are forced onto the students are the problem. Students should be able to turn in that interests them and not be forced into a project that is designed by someone that does not know the student's passion and interests. Teacher-designed projects is an ignorant idea that harms the student more than it benefits them.
