25 Years ago NASA got a picture of Mars that there Viking 1 took and it apears to be a facial features in it. Then Viking 2 got another picture of it with more of a shawdow effect. It was a very clear picture of a face looking back at the camrea. The photo shows a gray piee of land with some bumps that look like they can be facial features.

It became very popular. It was in movies magazines grocrey stores, and even talkshows. It caused a really big scene. People were arguing weather its right or not. Between people deciding weather its real or not. NASA was trying to get more images of it. So they can finally see what it is.

People got alot of ideas on what it might be. An alien, ghost or maybe even another human race. They waited pationtly/ impationly for them do release new pictures for more proof. People were longing for more answers, so Garvin gave it to them.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to get some better pictures. So on a cloudless day, Garvin took a picture, revealing that ot was just a landform and not an actual face.

But he also said it is very hard trying to hard to pass over that face and they dont pass over ot very often.

It is very clear that it is not an actual face, but people still didn't settle for it. They wanted more answers, but thats all they can get. A

better, sharper image showing that it's not a face, but a landform.
