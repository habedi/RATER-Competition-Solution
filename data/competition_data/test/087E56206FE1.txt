Dear Principal,

Community service. Something many kids have the heart to do and something others think is a complete waste of time. I am writing this to you today to tell you that many of my friends and I are currently involved in after-school community service around the Bay Harbor and North Miami area. With all do respect, out of our entire school I only know about ten or less children that are involved in after-school service. My personal thought is that you need to get the rest of the kids involved in helping things in need around our community. This is because most of them think it is a waste of their 'valuable' time.

All of the pupils are young here, considering the fact that this is a K-8 Center. The oldest of us are approximately the age of fourteen. Young enough to have at least a little time to spend doing a good deed which some of us kids do not even know the definition of. I am a true believer that ALL kids should be a part of at least contributing to one good deed per day. And if that task takes you assigning every single kid in our school a community service, then it should be done.

I was raised in a home where I was gratefully taught to be nice to others no matter what the circumstances were. But some kids do not have the privilege of having that kind of home life. And those are the kids that are not participating on making our community and the world a better place. There a re MANY people out there that need our youth, our help, and us students are just sitting around our house doing absolutely nothing.

You play as our role model in this school as the Principal. With respect, you need to take charge of these kids and take initiative to give the unfortunate ones hope to be successful when we grow older. They should not be considering potato chips, a couch, and a television as their valuable time, helping should be. I personally know and am exteremely proud to say that I have learned a lot and have come a long way. I take pride in myself and the good deeds I do for others. The feeling I have when I know I have helped somebody or something is amazing. And I think it's time that you let others feel the same joy I do.

This is your chance. And for most of us this is a once in a lifetime chance to have the opportunity to become greater people. The chance that will give us all a huge amount of hope and dignity for ourselves. It is time; the time to change this school from good to OUTSTANDING! And the chance for you not only to change the school... But the world.
