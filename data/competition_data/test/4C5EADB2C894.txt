Imagine yourself running down a basketball court to score a point for your team, winning a debate, taking the perfect picture for your school yearbook, or being the leader of a student council meeting. These scenarios are some activities that students participate in and find joy in doing. Many students try school related activities and result in being very passionate about them. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows them to learn life skills, help find a better activity they could enjoy, and make new friends.

Involving students in at least one extracurricular activity would allow them to learn new life skills. For example, if a student were to join Debate Team, they would learn how to properly debate against one another and find evidence to support their arguments. Another example would include sport activities. If a student were to take part in a sport at school, it would teach them about competition. When participating in sports many play to win and the game could get intense. This shows the players competitiveness. Also, if students were to serve in student council, they would learn how to be a leader. Students who are in student council participate in the meetings and come up with good ideas for the school. In life, this skill will be useful because it teaches students how to become a good leader. Students learn all kinds of different skills in extracurricular activities that could be useful later on in life.

Some students have trouble finding activities they enjoy doing. However, there are many options to choose from when trying to find the right extracurricular activity. Within all of the choices, students could find one they are interested in. For example, when I was looking for a school related activity, it was easy to choose one that I would enjoy because there were so many options that interested me. I chose to run for student council and I have enjoyed my time as an officer. Additionally, many people try to figure out what they want to do in the future around their high school or middle school years. Participating in an extracurricular activity could help someone decide what they want their occupation to be because of an interest in an activity. To add, if a student is interested in one specific activity, they might want to join more that are similar since they share common interest. Finding one activity for a student could lead to them finding many new interests.

Participating in an extracurricular activity would also help students make new friends. For example, when doing a team activity, students learn teamwork. Most students find someone they work well with within a group of people and it could eventually turn into a friendship. Also, while working with a group, some people find others that share common interests with them. Most friendships work because they share similar interests in certain things. Additionally, activities are always more fun when you can do them with friends. For instance, when I play basketball independently, I am less motivated and I get bored faster. Whereas when I'm with my friends, my energy is higher and there's more to do. Overall, making new friends is always possible when doing an activity.

To conclude, taking part in at least one activity teaches you many different life skills without even knowing it, some students try one activity and find new interests along the way, and while working with others, students develop friendships. All of these advantages lead to a fun and educational experience.Â
