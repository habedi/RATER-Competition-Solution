If you needed a B average to be able to play school sports that would be fair. It would be fair because student should already do good in school. Also, it would make students work harder. It will make students more focus in class and during test. This would make student study more for test and quiz. They will do better on project and class work. They will start doing there homework so that they can get better grades. I think this would help the student because this will make them want to do better so they can participate in the sport they play. This would also make the school look better if the students are doing better in class, homework, and test. This also will make the parents a lot happier and the student wont get in trouble because of grades. Also, this would look better on the students record people will see that they have a B or A average and they will know that they are a good student and that they work hard. This would make people take the students more serious when they talk about school. Also, if they have to have a B average then they will have better grades so this would give them more time to work on the sport that they play. So they will be getting good grades and doing good in the sports they are playing. I think it would be harder to maintain that B average but its worth it because your doing good in school and sports and this helps out everyone in its own way.
