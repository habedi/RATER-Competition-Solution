Do you think it would be easier for technology to do the work for the teachers and identifying their face expressions during lessons? Some think it would be better ways for humans and computers to communicate. This could be a big step for the future.

In my attention getter or introduction, Dr. Huang predicts, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" This shows that someone somewhere can be inventing something like this to help students in the future and can also upgrade technology into a better cause.

Facial Action Coding System also knows as FACS has been invented by Dr. Paul Eckmen, "The process begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles" (D'Alto paragraph 6). This just shows the way it works and how it has to be human muscle movements, Eckman has also classified six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Overall, the value of technology should be for a better cause and can help many people in different ways such as students by looking at their facial expressions on a teacher's lessons if they don't understand the topic. This is another way it can change to computers and humans to communitcate.
