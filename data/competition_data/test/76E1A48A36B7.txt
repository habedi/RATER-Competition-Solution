Viking Face of Mars Real or Fake? The face of of mars is claimed by lots of people to be real, the people say it might be a landbulge, ancient arifacts, aliens created it? In arguments like this there are other sides to every story then theres a great sum of people who think its fake that they faked it to get attention or get the community on this fact ,Because they might be working on something else so no-one looks into it.

In 1976, they first found out about this so called face. A spacecraft for NASA was circling the planet, taking photo's when spacecraft 2, spotted the shadowy likelyness of a face of some sort. The face looked like it was looking back at the camerafrom the region of the planet called Cydonia. The Face was also nearly 2 miles long from end to end! But everyones opinion is different. My opinion is that its a natural landform on the planet, Because why would some aliens make such a thing like that to just leave in the ground on that planet.

I think it was just an astroid hitting the planet and flying some of the debree's to a pile that looks like a face in a certion type of year. The shadows go over the pile of planet chunks to make it look like a human face. Also when that photo was taken in 1976 the camera's back then were very pixellated not high definition where you can see the detail, in 1998 the camera's were getting a little better as you see on the article about this "Face on Mars" it looks like the so called face is deforming because it has been there for 12 years since the last un high definition picture.

In 2001 the picture shows that the face looks cracked maybe, Because back then the camera's were not as good you couldnt see the detail, But now in 2001 the cameras start having greater detail so is that why u couldnt see the cracks in the other pictures? The world may never know until someone goes to mars to investigate.
