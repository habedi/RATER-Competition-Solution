Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus orbits the sun and we can see it sometimes. When a spacecraft lands on the planet it is only there for a few hours before it goes poof. No Humans can stay on the planet because of what is wrong with that planet. The planet itself is "170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth". Venus is the kind of planet no human wants to live on because of it's hot tempertures and their is no oxygen there either. Three decades ago spacecraft landed on Venus to see if humans could live there well we can't because their is no oxygen or anything else. In my opioion we should never live on Venus because their is no oxygen and very hot tempertures and this planet is not ready for humans and neither is Mars.
