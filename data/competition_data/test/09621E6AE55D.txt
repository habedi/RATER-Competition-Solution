Would you want to sit at home all day,growing lazier by the minute? The principal at my school wants every student to be engaged in at least one extracurricular activity. Not everyone will like this idea because they might not have transportation, or it could interfere with another activity, but we could work around it and I think this could turn into something great! I agree that all students should participate in something because everybody should be active in the school, its a good way for students to make new friends with the same interests as them, and kids can create their own clubs.

To start off you are only in middle school for a short amount of time, so you might as well make the most of it. In my opinion kids should always stay active in their school, like going to sporting events, and joining clubs so you don't waste your time watching TV all day. Also it's good for you to be active, and sometimes you just need a change of scenery. I'm aware that students might appose this for the reasons that they have homework, or better things to do. However homework can be done in class or at the beginning of each activity there can be a designated time to do a little work.

Also this program will help a lot of people make new friends. When a new kid comes everyone gets excited and are always very welcoming to him/her which is nice, but they might feel a little more welcomed if they joined a club, or team full of people who love the same things as them. You also could discover things you never knew you had in common with someone. I think this could really help kids who are shy as well, and they might start to open up more and participate in class, if they find friends that are on their classes.

all in all the school would be a happier place.

Finally one reason kids will love this is that they can create their own clubs. Everyone is unique in their own way, and different people have different interests. You may really love a sport and just aren't great at playing it, or can't play for some reason, and that's OK because you can still share you love for it by creating a club. This is an awesome way to become truly involved with your school because you can make clubs about anything you like to do. For example one person may make a cooking club, or a video game club, or even a homework club for students who feel they need extra help with a subject. I think people will finally begin to feel like they have a place if the principal decides to go through with this idea. Therefore students will be excited to go to school.

In conclusion this will really help the school, and students because there would be something for everyone. students should be active in school, it will help kids make new friends, and kids can create their own clubs are all way this idea should come to life, and why I agree with the principal.Â
