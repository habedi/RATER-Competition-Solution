dear TEACHER_NAME

this is your fellow student STUDENT_NAME and i am asking if all of 8A should perform community service because it will be a great way to earn point on our scholarships and since it is the last semester i think that we all should do it and it all so teaches us how to help others but some students don't wanna do it because they say that's they don't wana spend there pressures time doing it or they have to much stuff to do or maybe there sell fish but some people do wana do it. we need more people to help our world .i think that you should reward the people that do the community service a party because we don't have to do it and plus we need more people in my community service project which is helping find lost dogs and helping the shelter kids with a can food drive and a clothing drive for them because they don't have a lot to begin with . i think it would be a very important roll .so may you please make an anousment tomorrow reforming to it that's all i wanted to ask. have a nice day!
