I would disagree with making students do mandatory after school activities because it would get rid of the students little after school time, it is completely not normal, and is making most students do a activite that they dont like/ is bad.

Those are my reasons on why I think that having mandatory after school activities is bad. By making mandatory after school activities the principle would be very unpopular and no one would like him/her. In the following paragraphs I will break down each reason on why I think it would be an abomination if we had to do mandatory after school activities. So let me start explaining my first reason.

If we had mandatory after school activities it would take away our after school free time. What about the students that have outside of school activities like baseball, soccer, etc? Should we just expect them to drop their sports teams so that they can take some pictures for a year book no one cares about? Or what about family time outside of school? When my dad comes home I only see him for a hour or two before he takes three to four hour naps and after that he eats and go to sleep again. If I did after school activities I wouldnt be able to actually interact with him some days of the week because when he's awake I would be doing an after school activity. Also, the most important part is that it takes away from the students free time. We are at school for eight hours doing work we despise and they expect us to give away our free time for some unless mandatory after school activity that will never do good for us? I only have around three hours of free time and around one of the hours is spent doing homework. And that only leaves me with two hours to do the stuff that makes me happy, like play video games, talk to my friends,a quick nap, do some personal work. If I had to do mandatory after school activities I could do none of those stuff, thus making me a sad, over worked loser. That is completely not normal, with ties into my next point.

My next reason is that mandatory after school activities is completely not normal and all they are is forced work. They are making us stay after school to do work and activities that most students don't want to do. If we wanted to do an after school activities they would take one. We already need to do 900 hours of school every year, and if we had to stay for two days a week, one and a half hours a day, then it would add more than a hundred hours of time we dont want to spend at school. What we are doing more unless school work that is not even teaching us students anything useful. We could be learning or doing stuff that makes us happy but instead we will be doing activities that will never benefit us in the future. Basically no other schools do this and our schools would be that weird crazy outsider. We never done in the past and we dont need to start now.

My final reasoning on to why I think that we should have mandatory after school activities is because the activities at school suck. If all of eighth grade, around five hundred students had to take activities, then all the good ones would get filled. Only around 1/4 of after school activities are good and fun and the restÂ are garbage. Like right now, art, one of the better after school activities, gets filled sometimes. Now everyone will want to take it so all the other kids will be left with bad activities. Same with sports, the school isn't big enough to have even 1/4 of all boys try to play a sport like basket ball of football conditioning. And then what? Everyone else has to go to a bad club like K-POP club? The school just doesnt have the means to have all students go to a good after school activities. Thus leading to even more people hating the new rule of mandatory after school activities.

Those were my reasoning onto why I don't think we should have mandatory after school activities. Summed up it would get rid of our free time, it would be wrongful and basically forced labor, and it would suck for most students. These reasons are the exact reason why mandatory after school activities will and wont every happen. And if mandatory after school activities does happen, it wont stay for long.

So in conclusion I disagree with mandatory after school activities and I think that it will do more harm then good, if any.
