Who knows more, the teacher or the student? That's right, most of the time teachers know more than students with the exception of a few prodigies. Teachers are individuals meant to help teach and prepare students for life. A teacher can also help get their students ready for their class by making a summer assignment. These assignments are intended to help students familiarize themselves with the upcoming course they are about to partake in and to keep their young minds active during the break. Teachers have many years of experience and they fully understand their course and its materials. Therefore, homework given to students in the summer are more beneficial if they are made by the educators because teachers will include all necessary material the student needs to help prepare them for class; teachers will design the review so that it can be used by all students; additionally, teachers can build up or revise their review based on feedback of former students

Projects given over the summer are usually big assignments that students dread, however, digesting the contents of project can immensely benefit students because it introduces students to the information they are going to learn over the next year. Teachers who make summer assignments include the information they think is crucial for students to know before they enter the class. An example is an AP World History teacher making students memorize the locations of countries all around the world as a part of their summer assignment. By knowing locations of different countries, students can recall the general area and apply the location to the lesson they are learning about, like the capital of Constantinople and what countries surround it. Teachers may also assign vocabulary words for students to learn. The words in summer assignments are useful because when the specific vocabulary word appears in class, students who did the summer assignment will know the definition and won't get stuck, unlike those who didn't complete the review. Similarly, teachers insist that students are familiar with basic math concepts and the properties of exponents and multiplication before entering algebra 2. By knowing the information teachers ask for, students will work faster without having to pause and ask questions in class.

When teachers make the summer assignment, they create it so that all students can understand, review, and gain knowledge by finishing it. Teachers focus on all students and their way of learning during the process of developing the work; They don't focus on one specific student because that would be unfair to other students. Yes, teachers making customized review for a specific student would help the student tremendously, but that would not accommodate others because it is specific to the one student. A student-designed project would include only the information the former student remembers. Sometimes students don't remember certain crucial topics they learn in class. Establishing the fact students don't remember the whole course, they will leave the topics out of the review which in turn could affect and hurt future students. This could also mean students will create a review based on their style of learning whether it be more artistic or more reading based. Professors and teachers help their students because they have the obligation of educating, unlike students whose jobs are not to make sure other students understand the course material. In short terms, teachers focus on their students and their collective education while students focus on themselves and their individual education.

Over the years of teaching, teachers will be able to receive feedback from former students and revise or build up their review. Summer projects can be designed to focus on the topics that are harder for students as a whole to understand. Through the input of students, teachers will be able to detect the harder subject and include practice for the difficult topic in the summer assignment. Students may also suggest ways to make the review more fun or resourceful. Teachers will sort through and determine which methods of review are most abundant when it comes to the material by considering the students' recommendations. Trial and error over time will help teachers create the most effective summer assignment for students and in turn help both parties.

Summer assignments created and designed by teachers will help students and teachers themselves in the upcoming semester through the knowledge they have of their students and their learning habits. Teachers are there to help all their students and part of the way they help students is through the preparation for their upcoming course and through the review of essential skills for class. By helping their students with review, they complete a portion of their goal to make students successful in school and in life.
