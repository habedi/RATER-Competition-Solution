Although, participating in a extracurricular activity like sports,yearbook, and student council, it may not be the best for everyone. Some kids prefer not to play for a basketball,soccer, or volleyball team, It's not one of their comfort zones or something that they enjoy. Everyone has thier personal opinios,and people shold be recpect that. You can't force someone to do something if they don't want to do it, they would not be enjoying their time. Kids should be doing something fun,something they can enjoy, and something they can look back on as a good memory. Thats a big part of being a part of a club or team. Therefore, I disagree with the decison that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Asthma, Asthma is a shortness of breathe or someone having trouble breathing. People with

Asthma may not be capable or comfortable playing a sport where it involves intense running or a lot of movement. Some people don't acknowledge how hard it is to be playing becasue they dont have

Asthma, and don't know the struggles of it. They would be able to play but it would be involving a risk, anything could happen. For example if someone chose to play soccer, and the coach is making them run 10 laps, they can faint or just fall on the floor due to shortness of breathe. Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

Yearbook , some people can define or express it to be as a fun,exciting, and an adventures thing to do.

Yearbooks are full of happy memorys thorughout the school year, all put into one little book. It also has pictures of teachers and students, so you can see your friends,teachers,and staff members. Sadly, not all people enjoy it, they think its boring, annoying, and a waste of time. People who like it will be putting amazing effort into it to come out beautifly, and people who dont care, their work is going to be sloppy because, they didn't put any effort into it. Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does.

When students are serving as a student council ,

they will be taking advantage of it. Most students are very immature and should not be trusted with a serious job. What I mean by immature is that they would be goofing around a lot, not focus, and would be taking it as a joke. In order to do the job right they should be needed to find someone more mature, someone that they can trust, and someone who will do the job right and someone who will take it seriously. If someone dosen't have a choice to do it, and that's their only option they wont be doing a good job. It's better to get someone who can take the job seriously,and not fool around.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principals final decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because,

Students may not be having the time in day to stay after school for a a sport. Parents come home from a long,busy,tiring,and stressful day at work. They shouldn't have to pick their kid up from something that they don't even want to do, its just a waste of time for the kid and parent.

People who like doing yearbook will be putting amazing effort into it to come out beautifly, and people who dont care, their work is going to be sloppy because, they didn't put any effort into it. Why get someone who dosen't care, when you can get someone who does. When students are serving as a student council, they will be taking advantage of it. Most students are very immature and should not be trusted with a serious job. Don't make someone do something they don't want to do, sometimes it can result in a bad way.
