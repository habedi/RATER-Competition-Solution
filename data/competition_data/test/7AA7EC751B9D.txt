dear principle, i think that students should be required to do community service for three reasons. the first being it will keep them busy, it will teach them the benefits of hard work and it will get them off the streets and have them doing something positive.

the community service will keep kids busy because they need to be doing something constructive in their spare time instead of partying, watching television and playing violent video games.

also the community service will teach them the benefits of hard work because it will show them and help them get a perspective on by doing the smallest things what you can get accomplished.

and last but not least it will get them off the streets and have them doing something positive because if kids are at home and doing nothing they are likely to experiment with bad behavior. this can lead to them rebelling over there parents and sometimes getting thrown in jail.

we could stop this from happening if we get all kids to do some form of community service.
