i fell that this computer program counldnt do so well becase if your a teatch and you have had the studens say for 4 months you should have an under standing on how this person fell and what faces they make when mad, happy, upest, angry, and more.

what if this program works it could open a lot more programs to the world and help you with every day life or just work. for example say your going to ask your boss for a rase you could just walk by make it look like your texting your frinds and but you find out your boss is upset or mad you can know when a good time is to ask for your rase or more houres. but on the other hand this program could work for a while till it it gets something wrong and you lose your job and or say something that will hurt the other person. eve if they do all this programing whos has the money to go out and buy the software and program and whatever else you need most schools spend money on what they need not what makes them happy. and just simpily most school wouldnt want to have a prodct like this. for example apples vs samsung they both make phones, they run diffrent software, have mostly same apps, they are made same places, and many more but people are paying for apple simply because famouse people same thing with samsung. and to be 100% honest i dont see famouse peopel haveing this.

"

a classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." i think if this how the world becomes that we would become even more scumbags than were are already. it would make us lazy and we will loss ourselfs in more tech.

me personly i think that this programing could be good and or could be bad. but if this comes out you will not have most schools buy it or just most peolpe. i feel this would be something of the highher class and privet schools.
