In the modern era, we now have more than enough technology to effectively have long distance, from home, learning. With many assigments these days being online and the availability of video conferences, home/online schooling has become more and more of a viable option for students across the world, with benefits such as improved comfort for students and teachers, savings in time, & improved overall convenience, long distance learning might just have the edge on a traditional classroom education.

With at home learning comes serious benefits of comfort in the 'classroom'. For example, say for a student who is easily distracted by other classmates & uncomfortable in scenarios with lots of people; this student with the option of home/online schooling can circumvent both of these challenges when learning from their own room. Additionlly, I think the largest benefit of learning from the home is the ability to escape the typical school environment. Specifically, in the cases of bullying, an at home learning environmnt becomes a much safer and friendlier place to learn than a typical schooling environment. These changes in comfort could certainly promote learning, focus, and efficiency in the 'classroom'. Additionally, simply being in your own comfort space and working at your own pace could yield for much greater performance and understanding than that of a typical classroom environment. Even further, online schooling is a very viable option for students with severe mental illnesses or challening disabilities to deal with in the classroom. Overall, the benefits of comfort from an online schooling environment can assist students across the world in a multitude of different scenarios.

Additionally, one of the major benefits of online schooling is the savings in time. Say for a student who is involved in serious extracurricular activities that take serious time management, online schooling can become a major convenience. In addition, time is also saved for much of the teachers experience aswell, allowing for a more versatile schedule for both teachers and students. Perhaps a student has no transportation to school and/or lives in a place where schooling is far from home. In these sort of scenarios online schools thrive as a relief of education for these students. Like the added comfort of online schooling, savings in time and need for transportation can help stuents in a variety of different scenarios helping families in varying sorts of difficult positions still maintain and receive the education that they deserve.

Conversely, one might say that online schooling eliminates a level of communication that is present in a typical school environment. This counterargument states that technology cannot replicate the experiences of an authentic real life interaction and connection between teacher & student. To the person who advertises this claim, I simply suggest they do not recognize the versatility & effectiveness technology has reached at this point in time. In the prior 20 or so years this argument for online schooling was relatively strong, but in recent years the advancements of video conferencing have become so fluid and effective that I would say this argument has been completely killed. If a student is in need of extra information or has some sort of misunderstanding, all that needs to be done is a video conference with the teacher and clarification is just as effortless as if they had had a real life interaction. Technology has advanced so far that ultimately, the differences between a real life and online classroom are negligible.

Finally, the overall convenience that online schooling provides for students in varying environments is hugely beneficial. Say for example a family that travels constantly within a year due to a parents job, rather than jumping from school to school the children have the option of online schooling. Or alternatively, a family that has recently moved to a new country, does not speak the language, & lives far from any nearby international school. Online schooling has become a versatile and suitable solution to families across the world, and it is by way of this techniques convenience that many people in need of an education can be supplied their right to learn.

Conclusively, the increased comfort, savings in time, and overall convenience of online schooling allows it to be a versatile and extremely viable option for families in a multitude of positions. The positives of online schooling/schooling at home are in large disproportion to the negatives and for students of fitting personality and desire remains a large convenience to many families. With the options of both online and in person schooling, it is up to the family to decide what is best for their students, but it is quite the achievement that today we can offer such a variety of schoolings and education for our nations children.
