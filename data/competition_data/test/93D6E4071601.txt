Home Schools

I agree students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the students will take their own time, is peaceful to attend classes from home, and got all the time you need. Is really good to watch a video at home or online to focus on one thing or another. Mostly people need to be home school because maybe they are a slow learner or they do not understand very well so need to take their time on one lesson. Some students want to attend classes from home because they do not feel as confidants at public school or they decide to be home and do what ever they want. Is a bad thing because not able to be successful at public school and not be as confidants.

Students can take their own time to attend classes from home because they can stop the lesson and then try to understand it every part they do not know or how to do it. Is really good to take their own time because mostly people need help to understand the lesson are telling you what to do. The students would not be as stressful because the teacher will not pressure you to know all these lesson to order understand. Student most problem is to stay on target because the student is having a difficulty time to understand it. It will make them feel more stressful as usual then going to public school.

The student will be peaceful to attend classes from home because the students will not be interfere any student or get distracted by other student. The student will get more focus on one lesson or another lesson to understand more information in one big information. It will help the student to stay on task and finish the assignment as quickly as possible. Students will get all the time they need to finish any assignment at home school because all of these taking assignment on online or video conferencing. The student will get relax as doing the classes from home and doing the assignment.

Mostly student will rather go to public school because they want to be not lonely and to communicate other people at school. Is mostly reason why they go to public school and need help to understand the lesson as much possible. Is depend on the student they want to go public school or to attend classes from home. Is not really a big deal to go either one of them is depend on the student will focus more then being at public school or attend classes from home. The public school have a lot activity to enjoy, but attend classes from school is no fun like not having activity to work with a group.

This is my reason to pick attend classes from school to order more focus, not get distracted, and have more time. Some people think is not a good to attend classes from school because people may think public is the best way to be friend one another and have more perspective. Is really not a big deal going to public school because have more friend to be on your side or to talk with them. It will help the student to be ready for anything they learn to attend classes from home. Is more better then taking classes from home then public school.
