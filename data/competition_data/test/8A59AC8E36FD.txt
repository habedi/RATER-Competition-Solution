people's emotions are diificult to understand, they can say one thing and mean another. you may seem happy when you are trying to hide your sad thoughts or you can seem sad when, in reality, your actually quite scared. it is impossible for a computer to be able to understand emotions when there are such a variety of them that come in many different shapes and forms. a computer might just misread an emotion and claim it as something else the main emotions are happiness and sadness, these to emotions can make up any other emotion including fear, surprise, disgust, and anger. you can become scared of going on a date with your significant other, which you are really excited about, or you can be scared of someone who has done a lot of harm in your life. on paragraph 3 it says that Dr. Pual Eckman," classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness," however all emotions are made up of happiness and sadness, fear can be classified as either happiness or sadness and the same goes for the other emotions some people can seem happy, however, unless you know them very well and realize that they are doing something different then they normally do, it can go un-noticed, even for a computer that read facial expressions. on paragaph 5 it meantions that humans perform these calculations on a daily basis and that Dr. Huang's "new computer software stores simular information." it is physically impossible for a computer to know every emotion especially since people express their emotions in different ways then the rest. sometimes only a close friend or relative can understand what someone is feeling even though they look happy to everyone else.

very few people want their emotions to be documented on a computer where someone can read them off of. in order for a computer to understand emotions, the emotions and facial expressions for a specific emotion need to be documented. that would make it easy for a hacker to hack into your computer and figure out what emotions you express to certain things. on paragraph 6 the article says," imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a simular ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different." not only will hackers figure out what emoitions you express to certain things, they can also figure out what you like/dislike or what emotions you express when texting someone.

if they were to continue making this computer it would not only get a good portion of the emotions wrong, it will also make it to where hackers can know more about you without you knowing and use it against you.
