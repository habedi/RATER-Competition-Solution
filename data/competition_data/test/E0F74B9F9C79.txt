Do you believe if students designed their own summer projects, they would benefit from it ? Well 75 percent of students often slack when it comes to doing projects on their own spare time. Students tend to lose interest when it comes to school work, you can only imagine how it would feel for them to create a whole project! I believe summer projects should be designed by teachers, because some students are easily distracted,lazy, and careless. Teachers have a more experienced mindset than students,and are way more educated. With all the work these students have to do during summer, having to design a project would just be to overwhelming.

Firstly, teachers are highly experienced when it comes to school projects. Having experience means a lot when you are a teacher, you would have the right amount of education needed for students. Teachers would know exactly how to set up a project and the right steps to require during the project. For example, some students do not know how to complete a project. The experience teachers have gained over the years would play its affects, and benefit the students rather he/she doing so themselves. Teachers would know exactly what to mention in their project to assure students will learn over the summer.

Secondly, summer is a time for students to relax, get comfortable, and enjoy their break. Some students would already have tons of work to complete, having to design a project would just put the icing on the cake for them. At the end of the day students are just kids, after finishing two semesters of school they just need a time off. With a limited time to complete all these assignments, some students might not make the deadline. With all the work these students have to do during the summer; they would be extremely exhausted.

Also, students often get distracted easily. Summer has a lot of distractions around,friends,electronics, and even sports. To many distractions can cause a student to be irresponsible. With no parental guidance around all the time, the thought of designing the project will probably slip the students mind. If teachers designed the project, they could remind the student and the parent ahead of time, and they would be able to complete it.

In addition, some might argue and say if students complete assignments on their own; they would remember the information more. I disagree some students would complete a assignment not knowing anything going on about it. If a teacher designs a project, students would actually have to do some work, instead of writing anything down on a piece of paper and calling it a day. Students would have to remember what they learned and present it to the teacher, which assures they continued to learn throughout their break.

In conclusion, summer is students break time. With everything going on during summer students might not find the time to design a project, but if teachers designed it for them, their would be a big load off their backs. It takes a lot of work to design a project. Students minds will already be overwhelmed of so much work they already have to complete. Why throw another assignment on them?Â
