Let me paint a picture for you. It's the last week of summer and you're already dreading going back to school. Then out of nowhere you remember that your teacher assigned a long, and boring, over the summer project that will take that entire last week to finish. This isn't fair because it takes away what little time left from your summer break. This is why I think students should design the projects because they will ensure that not all of your summer is wasted, they will make the projects less taxing on your grade, and they will makeÂ the projects more exciting for kids to do. In this writing I will explain why students should be the ones to design over the summer projects.

First of all, the school system has been slowly making summers shorter and shorter over the years so this gives students less time on break. With this less time the kids have to cram as much fun and vacation as they can before they are right back in school. Teachers give these long strenuous projects out like they are Christmas gifts. Projects like these can take up long periods of time and essentially waste time kids are supposed to have off of school. Students would cater to the precious amount of time that students are given by making the project shorter and probably a little easier. That way the kids don't come back to school sluggish and and tired because they had a unnecisarilly hard project that they were required to complete.

Most teachers advertise these projects as if they were worth most of the first quarter grade, but in actuality the projects barley count for much of a grade at all. These projects should be designed to keep the students seeking the arrival of the school year, not wanting to drop out of school. If the students were allowed to design the projects then they would be able to make the project enough to where it's not pointless, but at the same time it won't ruin your first quarter grade and punish you for not completing it. Students know what is too difficult and what could be done with no effort. So if you let the students design it then the project would meet in the middle and be made for students by students who understand them.

Although learning in the summer might help students get ready for the next school year. Most kids, like me, don't want to spend our summers crammed away trying to complete an assignment that doesn't even intrigue us. If the teachers allowed students to design the projects then they would make them based off the interests of the kids and what they like to learn about. Have you ever had a project that seemed like the teacher tried too hard to make it relevant but it really wasn't? Well the best advocates for all things relevant would be the people who are living in it. Students know what is important and interesting because it also interests them. Teachers don't really know what kids want to learn about because they are required to teach their students to pass mandatory tests. So students would be able to peak interests of their peers whilst learning.

Students should be the people to design projects because they won't waste all of your summer, they will make the projects less weighted on your first quarter grade,and they will make the projects fun and interesting. So teachers should let their students be the designers of projects because they know what kids want to learn about.
