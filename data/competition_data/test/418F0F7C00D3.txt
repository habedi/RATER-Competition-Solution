I think that the author supports the idea because its good to find out about a new planet when we need to move form ours. I think taking risks for mankind is good because what will happen when our would is almost gone and we need a place to stay. I think we need to explor to because it will also help with knowing things and see if there are living things there as well. I think this because lots of sientits are looking at the planet and studying it and making all the obserations that they can make from just looking at it. I feel like when we do send things to that planet we are not finging anything else i think they ned to send people to that planet but be 30 miles away so nothing happens to anyone and nobody gets hurt or dies. Despite the dangers i think it is a very good cause.
