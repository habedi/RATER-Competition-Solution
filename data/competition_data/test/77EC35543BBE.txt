Imagine if your principal told you that all students will have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Would you agree or disagree? I think I would Agree with the principal. My three reasons why are; exercise, socialization, and having something else to do.

When I say exercise, I don't just mean physically. Exercising the brain is something many different clubs do. Even football and basketball require a sharp brain to be able to make strategies and avoid obstacles. Chess club is another great way to exercise your brain. But you can also be exercised physically by extracurricular activities. swim teams, soccer teams, and other sports teams are all great ways to bet kept active.

In this day and age, sometimes it is hard to be social. Electronics and social media take up our time and we can't talk to others like we used to. Being in a club, however, you can talk and have fun with others your age. No distractions except for what you are doing in that certain club. People could give you tips on how to improve, or vice versa.

Some students,after school, dont have anything else to do when they get home, setting aside chores, eating, and sleeping. Being in a extracurricular activity would give these students something to do and somewhere to be. So instead of them being couch potatoes at home, they could be outside running drills, having meetings, or even having a game/ performance.

What would you do if your principal told you that from now on, you had to participate in an extracurricular activity. Would you agree or disagree? If I were put into this scenario, i would agree with the principal. the reasons why are; exercise, being social, and having other things to do.
