Essay: Phones & Driving

Should drivers have there phones with them while driving or not? With all honesty, there are only a few people who doesn't have a phone. But, the majority of humans on this planet has a phone on them. Drivers should not have a phone in their disposal, no matter who it is. With deaths coming from young teen drivers, because we just have to look at our phone from: every phone call, or notification that vibrates in our pockets. We are humans who are still curious with the world around us, but with the mini-computer in our pockets we can see everything, with just a swipe of a tap or swipe of a finger. Now with drivers using their phone while driving, it will leave detrimental pain to families that are struck with the news that their son or family member is now dead. So, phones should never be used while driving, because drivers die from being distracted from their phone on the passenger seat or middle console.

The World Wide Web is a social area where everyone can connect and communicate. But it will distract the mind just as a man to a very attractive female, and be only fixated on the one subject for as long as they could. "Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people."(http://www. donttextdrive. com) In the article it states that:"Drivers

need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices."(donttextdrive. com) Now with those facts, others would pull up that: what if is an important call? Or Someone was in danger, and the one to call is nowhere to be found? But that is no excuse to be distracted just for one text or call.

Teens use their phone on an average of nine hours a day, just on social media and other apps they use. That more hours wasted on the news on in the morning, or time for studying for a test, or time to focus on the road to prevent an accident from happening. But teens aren't known to the fact that they should watch the road and drive safely. Now and days the quote: "At least 3,000 teens die each year from accidents caused by texting and driving, and another 300,000 are injured."(thezebra. com/insurance-news/76/teens-texting-and-driving) That's too many deaths and it has increased over the years. Not excluding the adults but mainly, teens are on the phone the most for obvious reasons. That's the reason why teens shouldn't have their phone with them as they drive.

As you're driving; you're focused on one thing, that's on the road and your destination. But if you have your phone in the passenger seat or in the middle console, and you hear the notification ringtone, then your off task on what you need to focus on. You will lose all concentration, even if you keep looking back and forth on the road and the phone. As your looking back and forth, just in a split second looking away a car will be speeding past a red light and you didn't see it coming. Next thing you know your in the hospital clinging on to life not knowing what's happening with the world around you.

Just over one text you had to send back that instant, without putting your life on the line first. There are cars that will allow you to use your voice to send a message or talk while driving without using your hands. But certain people don't have the money or credit to be able to afford cars to be able to do that.

In closing, you can see common sense should kick in to not reply to a text message or phone call while driving. It will cause: death, severe injuries, or damage to vehicles, and a court date. We shouldn't use our phones while driving because of those and another reason such as: it can cause damage to our eyes and won't be able to see properly. Now people, as I said before, they would disagree with this reason as for their jobs or a loved one that was in the hospital. That is fine and all, but that isn't an excuse to use to for hitting a car and killing someone in the process just over a text. You shouldn't use your phone of course while driving that's just not smart, come on use the sense that God gave you.
