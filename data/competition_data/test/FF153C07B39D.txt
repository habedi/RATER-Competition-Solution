A reason you should not use policy 2 is people will bring them any way and that will just cause trouble. Policy 1 is better for kids with cell phones then they can use them in free time and lunch. One thing about both policy's is that kids will use there cell phones when they are not supposed to . So either way it may be bad but i think policy 1 is better.

In policy one it allows students to use their cell phones during free time. That is a good idea. Many students would like that better than not at all. I am sure that many kids would be mad and think it will still be okay to use them so they will. but if you let them in their free time they will not care. That's the plan I would use.

But there are some bad things about policy one is that many kids will use them in class. But if you give them a warning they may stop. But some kids wont so you confiscate it form them. Then when they get it back they will not do it again. But most kids wont because they do not want it to be confiscated. That's is a good reason to confiscate cell phones if they have them out in class.

But policy 2 wont matter to some people because they do not have cell phones. But since they don't have cell phones they don't care about it like kids with cell phones. That's why I like policy 1 . I have a cell phone so I know that I wouldn't like policy 2 just like other kids with cell phones. That's another reason policy 1 is better.

So in my opinion policy 1 is better. I am sure people with cell phones would agree. But its not up to me but its up to you. But policy 2 would make people mad. Thank you for reading.
