Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its present because its 97 persent of cardon dioxide blanks. The temperature of Venus is even worst them Earth. Why would a scientist need people to Venus to make us die from the air and the clouds. Being at Venus won't do anyting better for living there. Some reasons why people shouldn't stay in Venus is the air, the clouds, and planet's surface.

The reasons why Venus is so dangers is because of the air. the clouds, and the planet's surface. Venis thick atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket. The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The plant's surface temperature is average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Our sister plane is so inhospitable. I don't know why scientist are talking about further visites to the surface. They think that long away that Venus had everything like Earth but it might not true. Why is NASA going to send people to Venus to study it? It's a bad idea to do it because all they going to do it die.

Is Venus really a twin to Earth no its not. This is why Venus has so much danger because of the air, the clouds, and the planet's surface. NASA should just send robots to Venus instead of people. Making a person to go to risk their life is not fair. Robots are the better answer.
