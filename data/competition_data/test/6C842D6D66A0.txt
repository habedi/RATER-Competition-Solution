Summer projects can allow students to focus on something, school related, while on summer break. Which is good because it keeps the school juices flowing in their brain and it gives the student something to do rather than staying at home doing nothing. When the students are at home during their summer break, most of what they learn during the school year is out the door, in about a month. Summer projects can be a bit too much when they are assigned by a teacher rather than the actual student. Summer projects should be designed by the students rather than the teacher because it allows the students to express their own ideas more and the students can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project.

To begin with, students should design their own summer project because it allows the students to express their own ideas more. For example, an 11 year old boy loves to draw, paint, and write and doesn't really get to show his talents off in school because he is afraid his friends won't treat him the same the way. His school always assigns each student to create their own project during the summer. When its the last day of school hits he gets excited and anxious because he knows he can be able to start thinking about his summer project. His creative ideas start to flow in as soon as he is released from school. He starts to write down his ideas that he thinks would be good to do during the summer break. His idea is to make a huge painting of his school and decides to write a poem to go along with it. It's the first day of school and he comes to school with his project ready to show it off to his new teacher. His teacher starts to cry because she had never seen such art before and how beautiful his poem was. She gives him a 100 on his project as she wipes her face off and tells him he should go put that in an art museum because it had looked like a professional artist had did his project. This example shows why it is important to have students create their own projects. Students can end up being as good as anybody they put their mind too when it comes to creating their own ideas. Without them being able to express their own ideas, people won't be able to see how creative their child can actual be. Students should design their own project because it allows the students to express their own ideas more.

Primarily, students should design their own project because the student can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project. For example, a student is assigned a summer project by the teacher at the end of school. The student goes online to see what the project is about. The student is anxious because they havent done a good project in a while. They read about what they have to do and ends up not liking the project at all. The student isn't interested and knows they are going to get a bad grade on it because the student doesn't do well on any projects they get assigned to them that the student doesn't like. It's almost the beginning of school and the student turns the project in and gets a C on it. The student know's that if they were able to create their own project that they would have gotten a way better grade on it. This shows that if the student was to create their own project that they would have been interested in it and would have gotten a better grade on it. Students being able to create their own summer projects gives them more space to create and think about ideas on their own without someone else creating an idea for them. Students should design their own projects because it can allow the students to be more interested/enthusiastic about the project.

To conclude summer projects should be designed by the students rather than the teacher because it allows the students to express their own ideas more and the students can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project. Students being able to create their own project gives them some kind of responsibility and ownership of their project. Without that students won't be able to express that kind of ownership until they get out of house or in high school. However, if students are able to create their own project they can make the project easy, therefore they wouldn't have to work as hard as they would, if someone created the project for them. Allowing the students to create their own projects can be risky, but it gives them that responsibility and ownership that they might need.
