Seagoing Cowboys is an oppurtunity to help countries in Europe that where left in ruins. The Seagoing Cowboys help people who are in need.

Joining the Seagoing cowboys is a great experience. We help people who are in need. And when we help them, a great feeling runs through our whole body and it is a feeling that you can never get anywhere else. When you join, you have the oppourtunity to see new and different places than you are use to. We got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. We also saw the Acropolis in Greece; took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy; toured an excevated castle in Crete; and saw the Panama Canal on our way to China.

The Seagoing Cowboys can have some fun after their work is done. On returning trips, after the animals had been unloaded frem their holds, the holds were used for games like baseball and volleyball. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

The seagoing cowboys is a great oppurtunity for a lot of things. You help those in need, can see places you havent seen before, and play games with your friends. This is an opportunity of a lifetime and everybody should take it.
