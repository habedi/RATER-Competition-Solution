Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I appreciate you looking back at the cell phone policy. I agree with your policy number one which stated to let children use there cell phones during free time and having them turned off during class. I believe that cell phones are very distracting and if you allowed us to have them on during free time there wouldn't be any thing to distract us from.

I think that allowing cell phones during free periods and lunch would create a relaxed environment and relive stress to the students. A stress free environment is very important for kids in school so they could be calm and ready to work in there next periods.

This new policy would also help kids out if they forgot there homework at home to call some one who would be able to bring there homework in to help there grades out. It would be nice if friends wanted to get together to study for a test in there next period they could text there friends to tell them where to meet them to hit the books.

In conclusion, with this decision there is a lot more pros then cons and its always a good time when you make the student body happy and more successful.

Thanks for your time,

STUDENT_NAME
