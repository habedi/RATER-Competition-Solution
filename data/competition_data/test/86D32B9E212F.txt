The face in Mars is obviously just a natural landform. NASA, actuaslly have done their research on this topic while conspiracy theorists just base off the details. Now, since NASA is doing their reasearch they probably have a more than likely chance of being correct they've actually studied the object to see what it actually was. While these conspiracy theorist go with the common opinion about it floating around, and do no reasearch at all. The conspiracy theorists think that may NASA is hiding the fact that aliens have made this from the public because it may harm their budget. Taking this to 1976, camera resolution wasn't high enough to take good high quality photos yet because the technology was behind. The picture was blurry and it was one of those, "you've got to see it to believe it" moments because nothing could be made out from it. This is probably where that "aliens made this" conspiracy came from, the photo is so blurry looks as though some sort of alien space craft had landed here or the doing of aliens for artwork. Now, when you fast forward to 2001, you can obviously see more clarity in the picture. It almost looks as though this could be some alien artwork, but this is more than likely just a from a ship that has landed there and made this odd face like hole. Furthermore, if this was created by aliens it would be far more complex and wonderful than a face.

In closing, this "face on Mars" and the fact that it may have been created by aliens could be true. But reason rules this out, these faces are just a natural landform that were there from the beginning, human created, or were made from a landing ship.
