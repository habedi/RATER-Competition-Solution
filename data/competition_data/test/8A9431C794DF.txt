The details in this article suggest that this article is presented well. The author talks about how Venus is very simaler to our planet Earth. He spoke about how dangerous Venus is and why it is dificult to go there. Then he spoke about how NASA will try to get there to continuer theyre reaserch. now how similar is Venus to our Earth.

Venus, the second planet from our sun is some what extrordanary. Venus unlike any other planet in our solar system is very similar to our Earth, so similar its referd to as Earth twin. Venus has about the same mass as our Earth, the same density, and is similar in size. But, unlike Earth it is scorching hot. this poses a problem when our scientists at NASA try to study it.

NASA or The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is trying to study Venus. NASA has sent numerous space crafts to Venus, but none of them made it. None of the space crafts could survive the hot 800 degree weather on the surface of Venus. Not only did the spacecrafts have to endour that but they had to withstand the enormous pressure which is 90 time greater than our Earth. Now that NASA's scientist have this information they think they have a solution.

NASA has tryed many times to study Venus but have failed, because of this they have thought of a possible solution. They think the can get a man to Venus by creating a blimp like spacecraft that will float 30 or so miles above the ground. Now its still going to quite toasty at around 170 degrees. Second the pressur would then be around sea level and radiation wouldnt be too high making these conditions surviveable for a human. Having all of this information definately suggests that the auther has presented his point well.

In conclusion the author has done a great job at presenting the information above. First the author has stated how similar Venus is to Earth. Then he spoke about the dangers, problems, and the conditions that NASA needed to overcome. Then he spoke about NASA's possible solution to the many problems they have with getting a man to Venus.

In conclusion the author has presented an informational essay about how similar Venus is to Earth, the problems that we have when trying to study the planet, and the solution that will help us get there.
