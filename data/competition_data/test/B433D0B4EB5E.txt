There's this cowboy named Luke Bomberger that crossed the alantic ocean 16 times. And crossed the pacific ocean twice. To help people that was caught in the World War 2. And thought that he could be Seagoing Cowboy. And that it was an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. And he was working two part time job's at a grocery store and a bank. 22UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. hey had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.
