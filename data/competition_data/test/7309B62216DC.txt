I think that the principal idea is a good idea because most of the student that are on the basketball or school teams get less than a 80% average and their not focus on their school work they only pulling themselves back because school is a first option because your parent send you to school to learn they might be proud but at the same time that your on a team but some kid loss focus and only care about the sports their a part of. They mostly failing classes and they do not have time to study so if you want to be on a team they have to balance out between work and sport so the principal should use this idea because the child their will want to learn more because if you want to be on the team learn what you have to learn in class first so if you really wanted to be on the team you do what you have to do so you can stay on. All do some Kid will think that it not fair because They representing your school in any league. And you grades or horrible.
