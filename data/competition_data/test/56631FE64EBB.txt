Dear Senator,

Don't you think that everyone's vote should count? Well I do and so does everyone else in the U.S. That's why we should change our voting system. We should change it to which ever candidate gets more votes wins. I'm saying this because there has been a couple of conflicts with the Electoral College. I will also tell you why popular votes are better for the nation.

Let me tell you about the Electoral College and the conflicts it brings. In 2000 Gore had more popular votes but less electoral votes which meant that Bush won. All those millions of people that voted for Gore got betrayed because the nominees who vote for the president didn't vote for the president they swore to. So they voted for Gore yet the nominees didn't and that angered them because there votes didn't really count.

If we change our system to popular votes then the people of the U.S would be happier and the system would be less complicated. It would be better because everyones vote would count because it would be going to the candidate they want and not people that might vote for the president.

This is why I think we should change our systems. Because with the Electoral College it is very unfair to people. With the popular votes everyones votes count and there votes go towards the presidents and not towards people that might not vote for the president they want to.
