This special artifact that was found on Mars might have been created by aliens, or a Martian mesa. On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 was circling around mars. Something different happened that made TV, magazines, even Hollywood. Viking 1 captured a picture of a FACE on mars. At the time no one knew what made this but NASA did have plenty enough of ideas to figure it out sooner or later.

An argument would be is are aliens actually real or are they a mythical creature that people say is real. The man NASA is talking to would have to find out himself and so would NASA. NASA has plenty enough cameras in space to know if there are actually aliens up in space. This could have been created by a Martian mesa. The face might of had many weird, or unusual shadows.

The only problem would be is there aliens in different Galaxies, or on different planets like the ones in our Galaxy the Milkyway. The Aliens could have flew over and made a face on Mars, or carved it themselves. The problem with the Martian mesa is the shadow could have been created by the camer or ship that was flying around the planet Mars.

The was to prove them wrong though is, we have been studying and flying cameras out into space for awhile and have been searching for aliens the whole time. NASA's cameras are still in space and they are still searching. The Shadow was to large to be created by the ship or camera that was flying around mars. The shadow could have been around Cyndonia which is common.
