In my Opinion, students would not benifit from being able to attend classes from home, teacher hele, more study,career opportunity, and activity can students get in the school.In home student they dont get extra advantage .

In home student can not get other activie, fun with friends, and good career opportunity. Some student work full time. they don't have time to more study they not cater to study. Tndeed, they not get doploma in two year.My friend His mane is PROPER_NAME.He take online classes in home.He has more then two year with this program his still surivial with this program.The class time is two houre if he not understand in this time nobody explian after that.He also pay $500 for one semater. And classes on two days a week.These program take long time.

Students can access in the classes, like teacher attention, class work writing and if students not understand, teacher can help their separatly. Teacher can assist the students together as well as teacher know the in the where is my this student is week, in readin, writing, listning teacher can more prepare for student.Sometime in the class other student can help our fellow.In the class if teacher are not avabile, school have other opportunity substitute. students also can stay after school for particie test, quiz,and other activity.

School have extra advantage for students. Work ppportunity, volunteer with school program, fun activity, games ,these thing is reassure to students.In colleges and schools have work programs access.Student can study and work is samw place.Schools amd colleges give to students access to make your on scchdule for work.First you finish you classes and after you can do your work in same place.Also school have social worker they can help whatever you can tell.In LOCATION_NAME alot programs you help by school.

Conclusion,better for students to take classes in school.Evening program, extra advantage, teacher reclaim, work opportunity, volunteer, for college recommend latter, ,school social worker help these all advantages avabile in school not in online school.
