Dear students,our dear principal had decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. And frankly I couldnt agree more. The students in our school are paying to much on their phones .All students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they teach you like skills,They help people get people of their phones.

The first reason all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is that they teach you life skills you need to know. For example If you want to join a sport extracurricular activity i'll us soccer as an example. It teaches you a life skill called team work. In a game you must pass the ball to your teammates and they must also do the same. It is impossible to win a game without working together with your teammates. Let me show you another example with the student council extracurricular activity. It teaches you about different roles you might have and the responsibilities they come with. If your the president you must be responsible and check up on all the other people in the council.

The last reason all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is that it gets them off their phones and communicating with other people. This day and age kids would rather be on social media and playing on their phones then be involved in an extracurricular activity and talking to other people. But if all students had to participate in an extracurricular activity then they would have communicate with other people. Communication is very important and the student council extracurricular activity could help people who have troubling communicating . Because the whole point of that extracurricular activity is to communicate and fix problems pertaining to the school.

To summarize, all students should participate in an extracurricular activity. They are good for student to learn life skills they need for their future. They are also a good way for students to get off from their phones and communicate with other students in our school. If students were required to take an extracurricular activity it would help our school.
