Limit car usage! While you may think having a car is a necessity, others completely disagree. According to the passage -''In

German, life goes on without cars'', street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in a new district on the outskirts of

Frieburg. 70% Vauban families dont own cars and 57% sold there cars just to move. Many find it better this way. For example,Heidren Walter stated- '' When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.''

In Paris, France, there is more smog then any other European capital. According to the passage- ''Paris bans driving due to smog'', drivers were fined and motorists with even numbered license plates were forced to leave there cars at home. Diesal fuel is to blame for warmer layers of air traping car emissians. Delivery companies complained. However, exceptions were made for plug-in car, hybrids, and cars that can hold three or more people. When the smog cleared,the ruling French party rescinded the ban for odd numbered plates. According to the passage-''car- free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota''- this is the third year cars have been banned, this sets a goal to promote alternative transportation and to decrease smog. This program influenced two other

Colombian cities to join and participate in trying to end all smog. The reduce of cars impacted Colombia in a positive way.

Therefore, causing the air to blossom and the air to blossom and new construction to occur. In the U.S.A, President Obama's goal is to curb the U.S green house gas emissions. According to the passage-'' The end of car culture'', the U.S has peaked its driving miles in 2005 and dropped there after. A recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. However the Mobile congress in Barcelona, Spain, laid out a business plan inwhich bicycles, private cars, and public transportation traffic would save time, conserve resources and save energy.

Concluding to all my information, many countries and states are still trying to reduce car usage. Therefore, reducing smog and pollution . This will not only improve the air , it also solves our time, resource, and safety issues. This will help to improve society aswell. Therefore, we can live without cars.
