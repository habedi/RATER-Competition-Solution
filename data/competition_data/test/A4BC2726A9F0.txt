These summer projects should be teacher- designed so the projects can be a challenge for the students, the teachers would be able to provide the students help when they have a question about the project, it will be easier for the students. teachers should provide a challenge, also will be given a short lesson on what it is on.

Teacher's are smart enough to give students or provide students with a challenge. Opposed to teachers, the students will find something effortless and easy to do. At that point it wouldnt be a challenge and they won't learn anything new. It wouldnt be a very difficult project either. It would just be hard enough to be a challenge to the students so they can spend more time learning about the subject instead of looking them up on the internet. Teacher wants the best for the students so they wouldn't give something out that they know you won't be able to do it.

Therefore, A teacher wouldn;t give out a project without teaching about it first. A teacher would give an example and teach you about the project so it won't be that hard on you anyways. students would know ahead of time if they have an issue with the teaching method or the project itself. It could help parents know what to do and how to help there own child with there project or anything else throughout the year. so i think its a good idea for the student to pay attention in the class when the teacher is explaining it.

Also, when you have a problem or an issue you can always ask the teacher. you can via text or email the teacher whenever you have an issue or a problem with the project. Dont understand the material just email your teacher and she will respond when she is able to. Even if you and someone else has the same problem then you two can work it out. You can contact your teacher and say that multiple people are having the same issues and it's not only you. If this was a student-designed project then it would be hard and wouldn't know who to ask.

In conclusion, there are many teachers who worry about there student. They think that they will forget everything that they have learned about. It could be possibly true that students can forget what they have learned and so it a good idea to give summer break projects so they can keep refreshing there minds about the topic that they learned about. I feel like the slotions for students to not forget aboout what they learned is summer break projects. These summer projects should be teacher- designed so the projects can be a challenge for the students, the teachers would be able to provide the students help when they have a question about the project, it will be easier for the students. teachers should provide a challenge, also will be given a short lesson on what it is on.
