A designated project that's meant to be complete over summer break, is a fantastic way to keep students'

minds working and ready for the next school year. Most students would prefer to create their own projects, but as a student I would have to disagree. I thoroughly believe that an over-summer project should be chosen and designed by teachers. I know how students' minds work, being one myself, and I know that the responsibility of creating their own project would not be taken seriously. I also believe that teachers would have better resources to design the project. Overall, teachers should be the ones to choose and create all assignments.

Teachers, obviously, are more educated then their students, that's why they're teachers, but they also have more resources and outlets when creating assignments. As a student I have trouble finding good, reliable sources when completing an assignment. I also don't have access to teachers and staff members that work at my school twenty-four, seven. Teachers have those resources and the people to help get assignments created.

Projects assigned over summer break can be created by a student's current teacher and from teachers in the next grade level. This extra hand will help students be even more prepared for a grade switch. A teacher-designed project, created by the students' next teacher, will keep their mind working but will also heavily prepare them for the content they'll be learning in the year to come.

Students cannot be trusted when creating their own assignment. From personal experience I usually choose the easy-way out when doing an assignment. Students will usually choose or create an assignment with the least amount of work and the least complication. I wouldn't expect anything less from a student who's been doing a countless amount of homework, projects, and tests all year. Teachers will create an assignment with some obstacles and one where a students has to put in an average amount of effort. These projects are meant to keep students on their toes and ready to start another year of school, which is exactly what teachers will do if they are given the responsibility of creating the project. A student just getting hit with the relaxation of summer should not be trusted with creating an assignment that's meant to keep them "on their toes and ready".

Once summer begins, school is not a priority to students. Sleep becomes a number one priority, at least that's how most students around me feel. When I reach summer it becomes difficult for me to complete simple goals like reading a book every week and trying to write poetry. Anything having to do with education or learning becomes an afterthought. A students who has chosen and created their own assignment will have difficulty completing it. A self-created project is not meant to be taken seriously in the summer, therefore, it becomes another afterthought. If a teacher creates the project there's more anxiety to get it done, especially if it's graded. If a student knows that this project is the first thing to go in the grade book, they'll stress about it and get it done. Nobody wants an angry text from a parent asking about grades, especially when the school year has just started. A teacher-designed, graded project gives students an incentive to get it completed.

While students are irresponsible, not dedicated, and careless when discussing homework and assignments, teachers are the opposite. Teachers are teachers for a reason. They enjoy what they do. Teaching students new things and helping them to prep for new obstacles in life. Switching into a new grade is a major obstacle for a young student, especially a high school student. Teacher assigned projects will help keep students' head on a swivel over the long summer break. At first, most students will be quite upset about an over-summer assignment, but going into the new school year they'll be thankful. They'll feel more prepared and ready to learn more difficult and new topics in school. They will be thankful that it was a teacher-designed project and that it helped to keep their brains working. When a students feels that relief, understanding a new topic in class, nothing feels better. A

teacher-created assignment will get them to experience that feeling, and they'll be thankful for it.
