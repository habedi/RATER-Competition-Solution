Luke's point of view on convincing people to go on this seagoing journey is he wants to go on this wonderful cattle boat journey.

He doesn't want to miss out on this great oppurtunity to go on this trip.

He knows it is an oppurtunity of a lifetime because his friend is encouraging him to go, but he doesn't leave home.

He can't resist the temptation so he goes anyway.

Luke knows it is a very rigorous job to do but he knows he might be able to help a lot on this trip that's why he goes.

Lue loves this experience on his adventure to Europe.

Luke is veer convicting on why he goes on this adventure. People want to participate in this because Luke liked this journey so many other people might.

When Luke has to check on the animals each hour he has to make sure he has to chech on them very painstakingly to make sure every animal is there.

When Luke breaks his ribs that's when you know that all of his jobs are super rigorous to do and work.
