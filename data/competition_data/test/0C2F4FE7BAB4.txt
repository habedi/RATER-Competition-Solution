Kevin Sirmont, a famous professor at the University of Iowa once said "a student will only go as far as their teachers and peers are willing to take them". This means that a teacher is vital to a students success and interacting with them is also key to the learning process. Students would benefit more if they attended a physical school because they will learn life skills, make amazing relationships, and deal with stressful situations.

Firstly, there are life skills, these are the most beneficial thing that the school system has to offer to children and young adults. An extremely important life skill to have is keeping a routine for your daily life, everyday of your adult work life there will be a solid routine to follow. There is no better time to start learning than when you are growing up becoming an adult. Working in teams is beneficial to the real world and is commonly practiced at schools with team sports, group projects, and PE class. These things may not seem helpful, however, they are because in your life you will need to work as a team, for example when you have a family or job those require you to work well in groups to be successful. Students need to work well with their teachers too, some teachers will play favorites even though that is not morally right it still happens and students need to learn how to get on their good sides, this applies to adult life in the way that you may not have a boss you like but still need to be friendly with and please. In school there are a lot of classes, homework, projects that you must balance in a short span of time, managing time wisely is crucial and practiced profusely which would translate perfectly with the work field when there are multiple tasks needing to be completed by a set deadline.

Secondly, making relationships that will last a life time. A trait that will never be taken away from schools is the fact that some of peoples best friends in life come from school, schools are great for making friends because you grow up with relatively the same groups of kids throughout your entire childhood. Growing up with the same kids is nice because you go through changes together at the same times and experience the same things as one another in life while being able to talk about them. Students can also learn great social skills while being surrounded by different kids in different classes every year you meet new people and find out that you like the same and different activities as other classmates. High school is a great time for finding out what your interests are, for instance if you like playing chess than you can join a chess club and bond with other peers about chess or any activity. School also offers amazing chances to go on great adventures with friends for field trips and going to school sporting events to cheer on your school with your peers. Going to school will give great chances to meet people you would never even talk to outside a school setting where you could learn all about different backgrounds and cultures.

Finally, dealing with stressful situations, this is very common in school. As the years go on they become more and more challenging yet more easy to deal with while gaining life lessons along the way. Stressful situations are in some ways good to encounter because they help prepare you for times in life where you need to stay calm. Team sports are a great example of staying calm under pressure, if there is ten seconds left in a basketball game and you are down by one and the coach puts you out you must stay calm to make sure you hit your shot. The same thing can apply to adulthood in the way that when you are counted on you will do what is nessisary for the proper outcome. One of the most stressful parts of school is testing. For tests you must learn the material, master it, then apply it to paper to show that you fully understand what you are being tested on. Tests will help to make you take the appropriate steps for success and mastering your craft.

In conclusion, physically going to school is much more beneficial than online school because you can keep a steady routine, make great memories with friends, and deal with real life stress. Although the other opinion could be understood because there is no bullying in online school to worry about, more flexibility to do work when it is convenient to you, and not deal with keeping papers organized. Physical school is still the right choice for learning amazing life skill that will simply not be taught in online school. Every kid should go through the process of school to make relationships that will last a lifetime.
