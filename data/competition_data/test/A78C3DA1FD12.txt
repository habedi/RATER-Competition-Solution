Schools that are required to give out summer project should be student-designed. Students should have a oppertunity to pick their own summer projects because it allows them to be more creative. It will give students less of a chance to cheat off each other. It will also help the teachers know more about their students, what they struggle with and what they understand.

Students can be more creative and willing to do the project if they get to design it themselves. If its about something that is special to them they will put more effort into doing it. Most of the summer projects I got I didnt do because it didn't interest me at all. In English, they usually give out a summer reading list of books they want you to read. I would try to read the books that were on the list but they never made me want to finish it. If I had the oppertunity to pick my own books then I would read all summer.

Letting students pick there own project would keep kids from cheating because if they have to pick their own topic then two kids can't write about the same thing the exact same way. Most students do their project at the last minute and schedules come out toward the end of summer. Therefore, they match their classes together or see if they have the same teacher and then they share answers before school even starts. Students shouldn't be given out packets with all the exact same questions because they will just cheat and learn nothing. Instead, we should be given projects that we get to pick.

If we get to pick projects that mean somethng to us then the teachers can know more about who we are and not just by some packet with questions. Students could make projects about something that happened in their life or something that means a lot to them. Most teachers don't even care to know your name not to mentin who you even are. I still have teachers that ask me what my name is when they write a pass for me and i have been in school for almost 6 months. If students could do projects that mean something to them then maybe teachers would know who they are and not just some paper they are grading.

In conclsion, Students should pick their projects and desgin the projects themselves. By letting students have a choice, It helps them and teachers too. The more creative students can be the more participation there will be. Cheating isn't accepted in school so why would you even give the chance for them to cheat?Â
