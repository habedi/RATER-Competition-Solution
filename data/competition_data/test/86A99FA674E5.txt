I agree with the principal that students should have to do one or more extracurricular activites. If students play sports for the sxhool they attend they could have lots of fun with freinds. Also with more people in diffrent clubs and activities the school could raise alot of money for new things inside the school. With every kid in the school doing activties they could all enjoy seeing other freinds strive towards there goals and do many good things. If the whole school plays for one of their sports teams all of the kids in the school would stay active and healthy.

While playing school sports and clubs the school could raise lots of money and would have to do less fundraising. The students that go to the school could have lots of fun while making money for the school beacause people will often bring in large donations. While people give the school money they could buy better equipment for all of the player and clubs. Like new computers,basketballs and even more thats why I think the school should have atleast every student particioate in one club or sport. Also studies say while your having fun or doing something you enjoy the time goes buy quicker. So all of the students wouldnt be stressed about long practices or club meetings because they wont be worrired about having to raise money and do tons of fund raising.

When playing on a sports team or a club you set goals for yourself and when you are in a great environment you will get to those goals thats why every student should do an activity. In the clubs it should be a stress free place where youm get what you need done in the club and dont how to worry about not having time to do your homework. The sports teams would be great for people who want to try new things like soccer,basketball and even track. Lots of students would be excited for all of the upcoming seasons. If students did a year book club some of the donations would go to new cameras and better yearbook designs. If the whole school played a sport it would just make it a healthy school in general.

If the schools yearbook club had good cameras they could take pictures of all of the sports palyer. Lets say if the sports teams won a championship the yeark book club could take a picture and say championship winners. Scince everyone in the school did asport or a club they could have a fun day at school where they paly games with the leftover money from the donations to buy board games water ballons and even movies. The student council could have a vote on a party or a fun day and that's a great way to teach the council how a demorcracy works. I think its a great idea to have everyone do atleast one extracurricular actvite for the school.

In conclusion I agree with the idea of having everyone do an extra activity after school. The students that will be joining the sports teams will stay active while having fun with their freinds. The yearbook club could help out around the svchool and takempictures for the yearbook and bring in lots of money from people who donate money to the school. The student council could have and election for spots on the council like president vice president and more teaches the students how a demorcracy works. So I think its a great idea if every student had to do one or more extracurricular activity for the school. Its would save the school time fundraising time and money so in all i agree and think every school should be like this.
