Dear Principal,

I strongly disagree with you all students should not have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Such as, participateing in sports,work on a yearbook, or serve as a student council.

Who would want to do a extracurricular activity when we already have seven hours of school that's over working us. If we have that added on to school a lot of students will be going to sleep in school. Studies show that in the U.S. 45% of students is going to sleep in school. So, why would you add an extra activity

So it can waste more of our energy? So we can go to sleep faster?

I strongly advise everyone not to do any type of sports. You will get sore from pratice,injured,break a bone, tear your A.C.L. or worser. Lke in football you can get seriously injured. Why yall want us to do a type of sport we can ge injured in? Studies show that 58% of students get injured by Participating in sports.

We should just and learn then to do the extracurricular activity. School is for learning right?

Working on a yearbook is just wasting our learning time while we could be learning about math,reading, or science. We can finsh the yearbook in one day so what's the point of makeing it an activity that's just takeing takeing time from our learning. Matter of fact you can just just select five or six people to do yhe yearbook it's no point of makeing it an activity. By the way way why start this early you should wait until June.

Serve as a student council? That's not even an activity that's just for one person so, why should that even be included as an activity? That's not a reason why everybody in the whole school do an extra activity in the school. That's just for that one person. That's not an reason why we should miss out of learning because of an student council. That one person should do that while we learning our education that will be great.

In conclusion, we should not have to an activity beacuase we come to school for to learn not to no extracurricular activity while we could be studying for the S.O.L. or matbe learning something new. We shouldn't waste time from our learning to do an extracurricular activity while we can be getting our education in an class. If we was to do that activity students will be fallling sleep in class, chance of being injured, chance of getting bone broken, tearing your A.C.L. and etc.
