Someone takes a selfie, and sends it to their friend trying to make it seem like they are completely happy with no problems at all. However, what if you were able to tell if your friend is really happy or not? There is a facial coding system that can identify other's emotions. The use of this technolgy to read emotional expressions is valuable because, it can recognize facial movements to see how other's feel, the computer can make faces seem more expressive, and it also teaches you more about your smile and whether it is genuine or forced.

It has been shown that Mona Lisa was about 83% happy when the picture was taken, it shows that it was mostly a happy smile. There are usually ablout six different kinds of emotions, such as,"happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness". This shows that there many emotions that could be discovered by just a simple picture. As an example, your eyebrows are usually raised when your are surprised or your lips would be tightened to show anger. The software would usually have mixed emotion, and it is usually compared to a nuetral face that shows no emotion. We humans are actually able to do the same thing, just by the look/expression on their face. Some specific artists such as, da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint specific emotions with facial emotions.

Computers are capable of doing many different things that not even humans can do. One very important thing is creating different expressions for others. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This was said by Dr. Huang, and it was normally used to make even animated faces more expressive.

There are some simple instructions that encode different emotions, this was also used to create Mona Lisa's smile.

For the real smile which is called "zygomatic major" which are actually muscles that begin at your cheek bones, it would lift the corners of your mouth. However for the false smile, the mouth would be stretched out sideways and it would ues the zygomatic major and the risorius. To many exerts they know that it is true thatfaces tell the truth and when a celebrity takes a selfie with a false smile, it is usually a sign that it they are not being truthful. There is an important theory of emotion that expresses and produces emotions.

Facial action coding systems can be used for very useful things.
