There are many advantages to limiting the number of cars on the roads. There are many reasons to not drive as much but there is still a lot of driving. People are taking action in decreasing the number of cars still being driven. There needs to be a smaller number of drivers. Driving isn't a life or death deal, we lived witout it for tens of thousands of years,

There are a lot of reasons to decrease driving numbers. The most important reasons in my opinion are environmental issues. There are so many gases produced my cars such as carbon monoxide that hurt our atmosphere. The air has been filled with pollutants that are devestating our whole world. Too much exposure to certain gases can be fatal. Driving is not worth polluting and hurting our atmosphere.

Many places have alredy taken action in reducing the number of cars on the road. Vuban, a German suburb, has banned the use of personal vehicles. As a result, 70 percent of families who reside in Vuban do not own a car. They simply walk or ride bikes everywhere with only a few buses to transport the citizens. Heidrun Walter says "When I had a  car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Paris did an experiment with not letting even-number plated cars had to find another way of transportation for one day and odd-number plated cars do the same the next day. Each violator was fined 22 euros or $31. They repeated that cycle for about a week. The amount of smog decreased drastically. Even Bogata has their "Day Without Cars." They've held the event for 3 years straight. Violators faced a $25 fine. In result of that, two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined the event.

In the past couple of years there haven't been that many new drivers joining the crowd. A study has shown that there has been a 23% decrease of new drivers between 2001 and 2009. I guess that people don't have the need to drive everywhere now. The number of miles driven was peaked in 2005. Ever since then people have been driving less. We are now at the same number of miles driven as in 1995. People also haven't been buying new cars as often as they used to.

All in all, there are many advantages of driving less. There isn't as much of pollution being created. If we stay on the same track, we can stop polluting the earth with as many harsh gases and chemicals. There would be more healthy wildlife as well. I understand that transportation is a must, but find more ecologically friendly ways to do it such as car pooling or riding the bus or walking. There are many solutions, we just need to find them.
