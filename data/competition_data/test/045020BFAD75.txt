Teacher-Designed or Student-Designed Summer Projects

Summer is a time for students to take a break and relax from school, but many classes are making students preform a summer project. Summer projects are given to students to allow them to continue learning even when not in school. The projects push students to work hard all year long. Summer projects are also easy ways for students to work hard and achieve a great score for classes. If a student does well on their summer project, then the teacher will recognize the student is committed and focused on school even when not in the classroom. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they will keep the students on task, push the students to learn, and will prepare students for future year long jobs.

A reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will keep the students on task. On the other hand if the project was to be student-designed then students could easily be sent off track. There are a lot of summer activities that students would like to do, and if a student is only focused on fun activities then the student will not focus on the assigned project. The teacher-designed projects will keep the student on task and give them a way to work on the project but still be able to have fun during their summer break. Keeping the students on task is important and not allowing them to push the project off is a great reason why the teacher-designed project is a better idea.

Another reason explaining why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because it will push the student to learn. If the students are not learning anything from the project then there would be not reason why to have the project assigned to begin with. The students would learn a lot more if the project was made at a teacher standard because it would be just like a test or classwork, but made into a large project for the student. Learning from the project would be very beneficial for the student because they are given a whole summer to work on the project which allows them to learn the material at a slow and steady pace. This is a great reason why the summer project should be teacher-designed and not student-designed.

The last reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will prepare the students for future year long jobs. Most jobs are year long and by giving the students the summer projects they are learning what it is it like to work year long. The students are basically going to be working all year long once they are given their summer projects. This is going to prepare them for what it is like to work all year long once they have a job. Even though the students are given a long time to work on the project, and will still have more of a break than a real job would allow, it is still a very good experience for the students. Many teens are hit hard when they leave school and enter into the workforce because school is much easier than a job. The reason just stated is a great example of why the teacher-designed project would be more beneficial to the students.

There are many of people that would agree with these statements above, but there would be opposers that would disagree. It is true that if the projects were student-designed then the students could work around their schedules to work on the project. That does seem very nice for the students, but there are many more advantages to the teacher-designed projects. Keeping the students on task, pushing the students to learn, and preparing students for future year long jobs are all reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The projects that students receive now should be teacher-designed. This would make them much better for the students in so many great ways.
