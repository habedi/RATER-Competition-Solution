Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There are many reasons one might support these two very different policies, but it is clear that one must be chose. I was thinking that if you had an opinion from a student's point of view, it might help you make a decision.

I for one think that students do not need to have phones in schools at all. If they need a phone during the school day, they can ask a teacher or go to the office. They do not need to have a phone with them all the time and if they are allowed to do so, they may become dependent on it and be more tempted to use it in class.

Students are already not allowed to have phones with them in class, yet they still keep them in their pockets, and often times use them. If they are actually allowed to have their phones with them, it is more likely that they will break the rules.

I'm sure many students would not like the idea of not having their phones with them all the time and would absolutely love that they would be able to use them at lunch and free periods, but I still think it is completely unnecessary. There is no need to have your phones with you when you can simply ask to use the teacher's or the office phone. If students were allowed to use their phones during school, it would only be a distraction to their learning, and therefore a nuisance in the building.

The main purpose in school is to learn and prepare students for adult life, but if students are more interested in socializing, it could create large consequences in the future.

Phones can be very beneficial in some circumstances, but school is not one of them. In school, students would be more likely to cheat with their phones, making it easier to get answers from other students.

Though the majority of the students that attend our school would strongly support Policy 1, they most likely are supporting it for all of the wrong reasons. Policy 2 is clearly the right choice to make. There is absolutely no reason what so ever why students can not go eight hours with out sending a text to a friend when they can simply tell them in person. As said before, there is also no reason why a student could not make a phone call using the office or a teacher's phone.

All I ask is that you take my reasons for enforcing Policy 2 into consideration and make the right choice for our school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
