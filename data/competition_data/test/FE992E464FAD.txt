Phones and Responsibilities

Lots of people love to use phones, I do as well, but it should be forbidden to use them, for example: texting. Texting is very rare around America, I also love to text but it can harm you in the future because it can get in the way of your school and school work. Every time I look around and to see people use them makes me feel bad because I know how addictive it is to use them at school. I don't understand why they can't wait till after school, or just use it at home. All your doing is wasting your battery and your brain, people don't know how important it is.

I bet maybe 96% of the world's population of elementary, middle, and high school use phones for texting, or in math class when they use their calculator but that's just me. People love to use phones, and i do to, but will it get you a job? Well, maybe if you call a job application. Will it get you a degree? Who knows. And will it get you an A+ on your math test? Maybe, because your cheating with somebody else.

All I know is, you should never use a phone in school, maybe at lunch or after school, but not in classes. Because I wouldn't want to get it taking away. its happened to me before, and I'm pretty sure no one else wouldn't want to either.
