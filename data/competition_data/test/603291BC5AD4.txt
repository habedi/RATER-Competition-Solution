Phones and Driving

I think that people should be able to use their phones while driving even though it's dangerous. If that person is responsible and can pay attention while driving and looking at their phone once in a while then it should be fine.

Phones are a key part of our life, we use it for everything we need but some people can't be away from their phone for a minute and that can be a problem if there driving people. They could get in a car cash a severely injure someone and also put there life at risk or maybe even kill someone. As long as that person is responsible and can pay attention to the road while on their phone it shouldn't be a problem.

What if there's something really important that you need to handle on your phone and your on the road you can drive and handle your business at the same time instead of waiting until later where you might forget about it later and what if you get a phone call or a text from someone and its important and you can't answer or text them later.

These are some of the reasons I think people should be allowed to you use their phones while driving and some of the reasons and risk of using your phone while driving. I don't think it should be illegal because that's too much because you never know what people got going on these days.
