Dear principal,

I think that you should follow up with policy number one which states that students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I use the core democratic value of Pursuit of Happiness to fit my position. The core democratic value of the Pursuit of Happiness states that a person can do whatever it is that makes them happy without harming anyone else or something else. In this case this students can use their cell phones as long as their class time isn't affected by the cell phones.

What I'm trying to say is that if you ban cell phones from being in the school at all times then the students will try to bring cell phones and play with it during class time. In that case, that will affect the students learning habits and education. You should be reminded that you have the power to make rules concerning cell phone usage! If you still feel strongly about the other policy you can make letters to all parents and children to tell you what they think about both polices. I have expressed my feelings to you greatly.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
