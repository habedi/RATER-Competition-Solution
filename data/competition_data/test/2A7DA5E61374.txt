Dear Principal,

I'm writing and asking that you allow cell phones in school, but the only way this will work if you agree to let us have cell phones during lunch time period and free time that we have. If you allow this opportunity for us to have a cell phone during these time ranges you want have a problem, their want be no interruptions and no reason for taking our phone if see us with it. If you at least to allow us to not turn them off during class time but have it on silent it want be a problem.

First, having cell phones during lunch time will be a great time for that because you don't have to worry bout us interrupting class time and I'll phone want be going off. We can be able to talk on the phone and texting . The free time that we have also is a good time cause it want be a big problem.

Also we can hang out with our friends and text those who is not in our class. Be able to have this opportunity will be great to have.

Another reasons, is if you do decide to let us have a cell phone their want be no interruptions. If we have our phone during free time then you don't have to worry bout telling us to put it away because its our free time. Now if we have it during class time then its another story because we can only use it during lunch and free time that we have. If the person refuse to not put it away or don't turn it off or put it on silent then its going to be a consequence for not only that person but maybe for everyone and it want be no more cell phones.

Last reason, is if we have free time then you don't have to tell us to put it away or wait til lunch time because we already know when and where we can take out or phone. Now if you not let us turn it off you let us put it on silent or something. If you tell us to turn the phone completely off than its a problem . What if we have an emergency and we don't know it until we get to our free time and something just happen . So that can be a problem. If you let us take it early before free time than it can be great but that's only if we have finish our work and turned it in.

Conclusion , Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free times , as long as the phones are turned off during class time , is a good idea.

Why I think its a good idea because you don't have to worry bout classroom interruptions, telling us to put it away, and we know that we have a time that we can pull them out. Now if you let us take it out early then fine. If you let us try it and see how it goes and if it doesn't go right then you can veto the cell phone policy from our school for not following directions or if you hearing the teachers saying the students are not understanding the rules and regulations of the policy.

Sincerely ,
