Being a sea cow boy is an amazing experince, if you want to be a sea cowboy you might just be in for a suprise.

I think a good reason to become a Sea Cowboy is that you get to see great things. During my time a Sea Cowboy I travel many places. In 1947, I got to go on a journey to Europe and China, and for me that was an amazing experince. Eurpe and China were great, but I think some of my specialist experinces were when I travled to Acropolis in Greece, and when I took a gondola ride in Vienice italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marvled at Panama Canal on my way to China.

Another reason I enjoyed being a Sea Cowboy were the things I got to do in my free time. In my free time sometimes I would keep busy by taking care of the animals. I had to feed them, (they had to be fed two or threee times a day) and stalls had to be cleaned. (helping out on my aunt katies farm prepared me for that) To have fun on board Sea Cowboys played baseball and volleyball, and sometimes even table-tennis tournements, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to pass the time.

One of my favorite things about be a Sea Cowboy was helping people. On my journeys I helped people in Europe who had fallen in World War II, and that brought joy to my heart

In my opinion being a Sea Cowboy is a fun filled experince with fun, journeys, chances to help people, and an opprotunity of a lifetime.
