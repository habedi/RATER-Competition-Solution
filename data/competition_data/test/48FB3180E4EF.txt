Dear principal,

I have heard that you are changing the school policy. That students may not participate in any after school activities without a grade B average. I would have to agree because of multiple reasons. That is that it would make students work harder at school work. Second, Many students do not pay attention to their school work more so than they do their activities. Third, The after school activities are great for your future, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't do good in school . I will explain why I think so in these short explanatory paragraphs.

First, Students with a grade C average will work harder to get a grade B average or higher. Those who want to participate in activities will not want to quit their club if they are really into it. They will try harder and be less lazy when it comes to school. They will be motivated. They will try their best to be in any sport or club they want.

Second, They will have no distractions. Because of after school activities, student are often busy. They often don't complete homework and often don't study. With after school activities out of the way, students will have time to do more things. Even though some fun is good every now in then, you shouldn't let it get in the way of more important things such as your future.

Third, School is a big part of their future. The students need to see this. Sure, you may want to do a school activity because you want some practice for who you want to be, but you need school to get you there. No good college is going to accept a C average student. Your future will be ruined.

So, as you can see, school is a big part in our lives. That's why I believe that you should change the policy. Students should be taught to not get what they want unless they give something in return. Their hard work and motivation. School will take them to their dreams. Sometimes, you must give up something to gain something.

Sincerely yours,
