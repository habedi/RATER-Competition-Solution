In my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cellular devices while operating vehicles it increases the rate of car accidents. I also think that there should be a law to completely band cellphone usage while driving. Cell phones are a big distraction while driving because many want to answer a text or a call right then and then they'll lose focus on driving. Drivers should be alert, paying attention to the road to prevent an accident from occurring. If drivers would keep their phones out of their hands while controlling a vehicle it would be fewer car accidents. Many new cars today have phones that are hands free and that is a lot safer than most cell phones. Despite the risks, the majority of teen drivers ignore cell phone driving restriction because they just think they are so cool and they know what they are doing until they get into a car accident. Using cell phone while driving has caused many car accident, many don't understand how distracting a phone can be. Also when texting while operating an vehicle will cause you not to look at the road. So you cant see what's coming or around you. So if you texting or talking on the phone while driving you not paying attention.

Operating a moving vehicle while driving takes your eyes off the road and many people when both hands for the phone. Many today are taught how to drive with two hands and if trying to talk while driving they take one hand off the wheel to hold the phone which makes the steering wheel feel more heavier that will cause you to lose the wheel. Also for those who try to hold the phone between their head and shoulder it puts them physically off balance and makes the phone more prone to drop. Which your mind and bodies first reaction would be to pick it up, making you take your eyes off the road. It only takes a quick second for an accident to happen. The first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is considerate to other drivers. When people use their cell phones on the highway or on a city road, their driving tends to become lousy. Someone pulling out in front of your vehicle, not letting you merge into adjacent lane. The driver ahead of you slowing down to text or call, and not acknowledging other drivers and pedestrians at intersections and parking lots. When a driver slow down to text or make a phone call, they are taking their attention away from the road which leads multiple ways to end up in an auto crash. No texts or calls is worth a bad crash on the highways and roads. It is not good to use a cell phone while driving because it can cause you to not let another car to merge into a lane, Then they'll pull out in front of you and it could be dangerous.

You don't have a reason to be looking at your phone and driving because their are alternatives you can buy an Bluetooth device that can go in your ear you just have to press an button. Some companies had begun manufacturing hands-free devices that allow you to drive carefully and still be able to answer calls at the same time. You should take that into consideration everyone should drive safe and be careful. In conclusion, You should not use a phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, Because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, And because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answers calls or text when you are going shopping, To work, To a friends house or whatever you may be doing, Consider the consequences.
