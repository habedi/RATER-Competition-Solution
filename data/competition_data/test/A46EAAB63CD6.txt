This sort of technology would not be usefull in a classroom because we would not use this all the time and and it will be a waste of money that the school does not have.

The only class that we would use the FACS is in a Psychology class but we wolud not use it all the time so it will just be staying ther and if a student deceids to mess with it he or her may break it and the school would have to buy a knew one or repair it which would cost alot of money.

And what is the need of having one of these machines when all they can do is read facial expressions and that is the only use we can use it for and we can read facial expressions so there is no need for it for a machine to tell us when we can read it ourselves.

AND also if its a highschool it there would need to be more then one because there would be lots of students in Psychology clasess so there would be more then one Psychology class in the school which would make a large sum of money that the school might need in the future .

Those are my reason in why this the FACS is not valuble in a student classroom.
