Limiting car usage will have a advantage and major inpact on people all over the world because it will slow down polution you will spend less money and it will bring people together more

When limiting car usage it will bring down the pollution rate and help the world. Less  people have been driving since 2005, as of april 2013 9 percent less than in 1995. less people are driving in the us but more people are driving in london so they have had days where no one drives but taxies and buses.

people also will soend less money if they stop driving as much because the people will not have to buy gas,change the oil in ther vehicles. maintain the ware and tare that  then need everyday will only have to buy tires one a year because they will wear down slower with less miles on them. many people want buy and new cars because they will reilize that the dont need as much as they have been before.

By driving less it will bring more people together becasue while walking to work or on the bus people will make new friends. The will meet new people walking down the sidewalk and also more familey will stay together more becuas they will stay home more becuase it will be harder to go place that they would want across town so it would also bring famileys tgether more.

In Conclution i think that limating car usge would be a good thing because ther would be less polution and people would spend less money than what they do now it would also bring more people together and help people make new friends.
