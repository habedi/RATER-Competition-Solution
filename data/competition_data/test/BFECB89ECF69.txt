Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that I have some suggestions about the cell phone policy. I agree upon the first policy," Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time ". Also I think that students should be able to step out of class to use the phone incase of an emergency. Such as," A family member is in the hospital ", or things like that.

Also, I think that when students get their phone taken from texting in class, that they should get their phone confiscated and a phone call home regarding why their child's cell phone was taking from them. When things like that happens, there will be less focus on work and more focus on texting in class.

The second policy of the cell phone rule:" Do not allow students to have phones at school at all", I do not agree upon. I disagree on that policy because a child might have left their key at home and their parent wouldn't be home a current time and that student will be locked out of the house. Things like this happens all that happens all the time because a child doesn't have a way to get in touch with the parent's. That's why I came up with them few suggestions.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
