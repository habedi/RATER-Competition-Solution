Imagine knowing you are going to be bored at home. Or that all of your friend were in an extracurricular activity and you weren't. Relax by playing with your friends or singing your heart out onstage. An extracurricular activity would be a great thing for you to try. I agree with this decision, because it would be a good way to learn new things, if you choose a sport as an activity it could teach you discipline, and it can help you make new lifelong friends.

It can be a great lace to learn new things. Some students parents don't teach them how to do certain things like how to be a leader. So if that kid joined something like Beta Club the teacher over that club could. It could help you get a job when you are older. Say during an extracurricular activity you were to learn a new skill. You could use that skill for a future job. It could be an unusual thing and no one else knows how to do it but you do. It could make you a lot of money in the future.

It can be a great place for a child to get disciplined. If they played sports a coach is most likely not going to deal with disrespect. Most athletes would get kicked out if they said or did something disrespectful i front of their coach , so they would learn not to be disrespectful without their coaches watching them. So in a way it would also benefit the parent or guardian. It would help them later in life when they get a job. You can't just disrespect your boss, unless you want to lose your job.

It can also be a great place to make lifelong friends. You may not find someone you have something in common with during regular school, because you are just doing school work. But if you were to participate in an extracurricular activity you can find someone you have something in common with and make a new friend. You can connect over football, baseball, or soccer. I can see why some people would disagree, because if you don't like talking to new people or it gives you anxiety it could be bad for you. But it can be great so you can work on your social skills without a teacher making you talk to them.

To conclude I agree with making everyone join an after school activity. It could help you learn new things, it could help you lean discipline for the future, and it could help you make new lifelong friends. There are a lot of pros of this happening. Even though some people wouldn't like it. I think the majority would. Also extracurricular activities are fun. Who wouldn't want to be part of a team.
