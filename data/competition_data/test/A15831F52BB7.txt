Well i think we should chang  them becuase some people can get confussed about who they vote for. I think it be good to chang them becuase a president could get a lot more votes but when the other voter get one or two more Electoral College votes then they would win. I think they should be chang becuase there could be 500,000 voter but then for california 55 voter represen 35million voter. Like in 2000 seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all even Rhode Island and the 25 largest voter didn't even see a campain ad.

It not even the people who elect the president it the electors who elect the president. It says that Gore had more populare votes then Bush but lts electoral College votes that help  him  win so they say that if u have more electoral votes then populare u win. When he increased his plurality in some states he increased his votes that shows a bad president to people and he won't now what to do the people don't feel like he there president.
