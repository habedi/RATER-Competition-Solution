should students or should teachers design their summer homework? I had a really hard time chosing between these two since i can see why having kids design their own homework could be a bad thing but it could also be a good thing. I had it the same way about having teachers createing the homework, is it really the best choice? i don't know. I ended up, after thinking a lot about it, to think that kids would be the best option to create their summer homework.

These kids are expected to some time over the next 6 weeks to choose boring homework over their frinds, goodweather, pooltime, and other fun activities. What do you think that would end up in? them doing a little bit everyday or them doing it all a couple days before school starts and ruin the whole point of it? I think the later, but how do you change that? if they were part of designing the homework they would be able to make it more fun for themself and their friends and therefore be more motivated to do it more often than the last couple days of their summerbreak. If you want kids to do it more often than once every two weeks they need to be self-diciplined which creating the homework can teach them. They would have to be diciplined enough to not just choose the easiest way out but the most productive way out. Having them try and create homework for their summerbreak may start a chain reaction and make them more diciplined in doing their homework for the rest of the year since they got to experience the work and effort that is put into making their homework.

Some kids need their " aha so that is why I'm learning this subject " experience, which is pretty important because it helps them reply a subject to the real world which help them learn future things in that subject easier. I belive that having them help design their summer projects would help with that. I know personally that I never had it that way in woodwork, art, music or fysics/chemistry and I do belive I could have been so much better at it if I have my aha experience. I had that experience with english pretty quickly and look at me now a foreign exchange student writting a english sol. Another experience they need is the " this is actuallt pretty fun/interesting " experince. This experience is when you find yourself fasinated or having fun with school because you like what you are learning about. I had it that way with social studies and history which is the only reason I have a 108/100 in my history class this quater. Having them design the project would mean that they have the power to make it fun which gives them the power to make the class fun so they can have good grades and interesting conventations about what they are learning. These experiences could also help them figure out what they want to do when they get older, which is pretty important.

Despite seeing all these reasons why kids should make their own homework, I can also see why they shouldn't. I could easily imagine that a kid would take the level down so they wouldn't learn anything from it since they only know what they know and not what they don't know. I don't belive that kids and teachers ever is going to come to an agreement over the amount of homework. I also could imagine that a child would take the lowest work amount possible, which in my eyes don't sound like the purpose if summer projects. Where is their brain in this? having a fun summerbreak with their friends and family or keeping up with their learning? I don't think many children think far enough to keep up with their education when it comes to summerbreak.

in conclution I have decided that a student designed project would be the best way to go around summer projects/homework. I think that students should be able to choose what their project should be about, but I don't think they should have control on amount or level. I do belive that the benefits of having them design the projects overweights the the negative consequences of it. I also think that them learning how to be responsible and desiplined enough to make the project and actually getting them done could have massive benefits for them in the future. So why should teachers design summer projects when the student created ones have so many more benefit and is more effective?
