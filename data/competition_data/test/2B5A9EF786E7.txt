To the Principal, I believe that students should be able to play sports with a grade C average in order to participate in any sport or school activities. Considering that some students may have a grade point average above a grade B average, they can be failing a class and isn't learning what they are supposed to. If the student has a grade C average, the school should make students raise their class grade that is lower than a C. In my opinion, I believe that the school's policies should require only student athletes or great students to attend school activities. Instead of changing the school policies, the school should first make grade cuts for students with bad grades participating in the sports activity and let students that have a grade B average. Therefore I believe that the principal should not change the school's policies and just help the students wanting to attend and sport or school activity.
