"Oh my god", said Generic_Name. "Im too stressed from all the homework and tests, I can't do these extracurricular activities". Me too, I said. This is too much work for us. "How am I supposed to study for my test, If I have to do these activities", Said Generic_Name. This is causing too much stress and anxiety among students, I said. "Look at all of classmates, they all look so tired from all these activities". I agree Its just too much for these students to handle all at once. This is also causing less effort on tests and other stuff. Which can also lead too worse grades and a bad mood among the students. "My parents are gonna be mad at me now because of my grades"! I agreed my grades aren't looking the best too. We should tell the principal about this. Students shouldn't participate in any extracurricular activities because it causes too much stress and anxiety, worse grades, and from all the stress causes a bad mood.

First, extra activities are causing too much stress and anxiety for students. Stress is becoming a huge problem in schools. For example my friend Generic_Name had stress from all these activities and now he won't even talk to anyone. Anxiety is also becoming a huge problem in schools. Another example is my brother had so activities to do after school it gave him anxiety and stress that his grades became terrible. Stress can eventually lead to depression which isn't good for anyone. For example my friend will had depression form school and the stress now he has to go to therapy. Overall extra activities cause these issues and aren't good for everyone.

Next, From activities students grades are getting worse. Grades are a huge priority for students. For instance my cousin had so many activities to do his parents got mad because of his low grades in school. Low grades will impact your future. Another example my sister had low grades because she had to time to fix them had to stay after school. Low grades will make you have a bad appearance. Last example is my classmate Generic_Name had very low grades form his extra activities that no one wanted to be friends with him. In the end extra activities result in low grades for students.

Last, the stress form activities will make you more frustrated and have a bad mood. Being frustrated would lower your effort and your grades. My classmate Generic_Name was so stressed and frustrated she didn't want to do anything in school. Having a bad mood would make you lose friends and get into fights easily. Next example my brother Generic_Name was so mad and stressed he didn't want to talk to anyone and he ended up losing a lot of friends. Too much frustration might lead to depression. Last example my cousin Generic_Name was frustrated from these activities he almost had depression. At the end being stressed and being frustrated is not good for the student.

"Im so happy", said Generic_Name. I can't believe the principal said yes I said. "Now we don't have to be worried about our grades", said Generic_Name. "No more being stressed about your grades"! I agreed now we have much more time to study and learn. Extra activities cause too much stress and anxiety among students. We don't have to be worried about these activities anymore.
