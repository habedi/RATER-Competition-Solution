dear principle, i feel as if community service is just what children need these days. they seem to think that video games, texting and listening to music is something "we need to do" after all is said and done ask yourself do we really need this. I myself am different, our family has a farm so i understand what work and play are, and i think that its fun to work. However along with this teaches you life skills. so when i see how long kids can just sit infront of the tv or walk into a pole while texting i worry about our feature. For example it wouldn't kill us to help children at the elementary school with something they don't understand in math class or social studies, it would be fun.

I ask you principle to choose for us to have community service as a favor to our growth as young people, because someday it will all make sense when they own a huge business and we can look back and thank you.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
