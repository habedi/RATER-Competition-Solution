Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you should not change the current policy, making students have at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities.

I think this because they don't always have time to do the required homework, they could have problems keeping up in class, and it could lead to self esteem issues.

One reason is because practices for sports or for something like theater tend to be everyday and go for around 2 hours or more.

Then, the kids in the activities have to make time to do homework and study which is hard to do.

Some kids might have to stay up late to do these activities, making them really tired when they go to school the next day.

It is proven that if you did not get enough time to sleep, you get worse grades on tests and stuff than you would if you slept good the previous night.

If you get a bad grade on your test or don't do your homework, it makes it hard to keep a good grade in the class.

Then if the kid gets below a B average, he or she would get kicked of the team or club.

Keeping the level at a C average is much easier to obtain than a B average.

Also, the kid could have problems with what the class is learning but can't come in after school for extra help because the kid has to go to sports practice, play practice, etc.

If teachers hand out a lot of homework one day, the kid might not be able to finish it all making them fall behind in class, resulting in them having to give up sports until they get their grade higher which can be a hard thing to do.

Being kicked of the team could result in self esteem problems.

They might get self esteem problems because they weren't good enough to balance school and activities.

When you have a low self esteem, you tend to not do as good in school as you normally would because you think you can't do it.

Also, it could result in problems in the future.

To recap, I think that keeping the cut off at a C average instead of raising it to a B average is a good idea because than if they don't do good in a certain class, it doesn't drag them down; so it won't cause self esteem problems; and so they can catch up in certain classes when they have the time.
