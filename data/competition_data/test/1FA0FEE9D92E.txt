Dear principal,

The change in the sports policy is very naive, and it will not bring up student's grades, but bring down the performance of the sports teams. Some students who are talented at sports have a hard time with schoolwork, and getting a C is the best that they can do. A C is average, and if a student is average then it doesn't make sense to punish them. I think if a child can excel at both then we should encourage them to do so, but we must be reasonable. The coaches should realize that schoolwork comes first, and most coaches do, but the teachers can't expect an average student to do better work than they can possibly do before they participate in an activity that they care about. School should be about helping the students excel in all areas of life, and extracurricular activities help them to be well rounded, and gain confidence in themselves. The students are the politicians and scientists of tomorrow, but they are also the future sports stars, artists, and writers. If you cut a student who is doing their best at school then you will lose a athlete, and gain nothing from it.

sincerely a concerned student
