When summer time comes around, students get over 70 plus days of no school. Throughout those days, having school require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a good idea. Having fun and taking a break is good also, but I know students can find time to work a little bit on school and learn as the days goes on. These summer project should be teacher-designed because the work will allow students to prepare for the coming year, help students not forget what they have done, and challenge students to actually understand and do the project.

Every year school and school work gets more and more challenging. When allowing teachers to design these projects, it will not only be based on the following school year, but it will also be helpful for students to know in advance of what they should be expecting. Teachers know what is best for their students. So when you allow teachers to design these projects, you are allowing these students to come into the school the next year knowing at least a little bit about the class. For example, as a high school student, when you get summer projects it usually consist of things that you are going to need to know for the coming year. This means if you don't want to be behind or clueless the coming year, you are going to have to do the work. This also means to know the things for next year, you are going to have to review or have remember the things you have learned last year. This is really a great thing because these projects will allow you to have something school related to work on when you are not in school for that long period of time.

In two months, it is surprising how much someone can forget things. These teacher-designed projects will allow students to have to think and remember things they have learned before. This will conduct in students looking through their old notes or looking up these information, which will help retrace their memory. As a student myself, I know what it's like getting a project over the summer and not getting anything over the summer. The summers you don't get anything, can even lead you to forgetting how to write well. Not receiving anything over the summer can cause memory lost and have students not prepared for the following year. And usually, what you learn the following year conduct some of the things you have learned before and when you are not prepared you are behind. Summer Projects are usually not that long and can definitely be done in the two months you are given. This will help students preparing for the coming year and allow students to have something to do school related through out the break. Which might be disliked by students, but it is something important to do because education is most of the time the key for a better life. People in the world go through so much trouble to get educated while majority of the people in the United States get it for free and even have free transportation. So at the end of the day there is nothing for students to complain about.

Even though it could be good to have a student-designed projects, to allow students do the things they are interested in. It is not always safe to go that path, because as students they don't usually want to do work. So when you allow them to choose their path, they are most likely to choose the one that requires less time and is usually something they are not interested in. So to make it safe and challenging, teacher-designed projects should be chosen as the path to be taken when creating a summer project. These projects could challenge students to be outside the box, which will allow creative thinking and actually make students work on it because even though taking a break from school is good. Making students do summer project will make students not have a problem the following year. This will allow students to take a bit of time out of their day to do something that is very useful and and important in their educational time. Because what is the point of learning for about 10 months, if you can simply forget is in the 2 months of not receiving anything to retract your memory.

In conclusion, these summer project should be teacher-designed because the work will allow students to prepare for the coming year, help students not forget what they have done, and challenge students to actually understand and do the project. Things like this will not only help students stay close to school, but will also continue educating students even when they are not in school.
