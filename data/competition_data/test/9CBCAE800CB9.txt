Advancements in modern technology allow people to understand more about their personal career, health, and education goals than ever before. These advancements have also made communication extremely accessible, giving people the opportunity to talk online through forums, audio, and video chats from wherever there is internet connection. While some would argue that learning in a building is the optimal way to earn an education, classes from home can create a more flexible schedule for students and teachers that can be beneficial for those with jobs, extracurriculars, health complications, or even travel time.

There are plenty of reasons why attending classes from home can be advantageous for students. One prominent reason: travel. Students take the bus from all over the area, some waking as early as 5:00AM to get breakfast and out the door, only to arrive hours later. Similarly, students outside of bus zones must be dropped off or drive to school on their own, potentially taking time from their parent's mornings or arriving late. For many students, this problem could disappear by taking online courses that don't require specific arrival times, and even provide learning for days when travel weather isn't optimal.

Like past generations, today's students are extremely passionate about extracurriculars: be it music, sports, or theatre. Additionally, students also have jobs or apprenticeships that will aid their careers in the long run. Many are already set on developing their future careers, meaning that specializing in their passions is more important than core classes. Students may dedicate hours out of their daily lives to jobs, arts, volunteer work, etc., which poses the risk of falling behind on schoolwork. By having classes from home, students can get all their classwork done at times most available to them, while stressing less about working on what they truly love.

Many enjoy school for the social aspect, and think enrolling in online courses would take away from interactions available in a physical building. Others are more introverted, and get tired of seeing people 24/7. It is also important to remember that many students suffer from health complications such as depression, long-term illnesses, eating disorders, or anxieties that require treatment and make thriving in a school environment difficult. Online courses can be beneficial to all types of people. Think: if less time is spent on travel, other students aren't posing as learning distractions, and all work is assigned in advance, students will have more time to gather with friends, relax, or work with a treatment team to help improve mental and/or physical health. Some students complain they won't ask teachers questions face-to-face outside of class; however, with e-mail and instant messaging, it's easy to get in contact and often a faster way to get caught up on work.

Online courses can be beneficial to all students. By pacing themselves and freeing up time wasted from an average school day, students can spend more time doing what they want rather than feel stuck in the trap of a building.Â
