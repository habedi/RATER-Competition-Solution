I think the principal should make students do community service. He should because its nice to see people helping out the community like picking up trash helping people that need help. For example some schools get trash up by students or others and it looks nasty. That's why we need people that will give up there time to make better and look nice. For some people say "i don't wont do community service" well its ok but its really sad to see schools trash up but sometimes not even schools there could be highways and also streets. Also for my friends that don't wont to do it, it sad because they just wont to be with there friends, texting, playing video games and its just sad. I will do community service and i well volunteer my time to help the community. So if i were the principal i should have make the students do community service.
