Driverless cars are coming? When this comes to mind I am against it. Driverless cars are a riduculous and dangerous idea. What would be the point of even having a car if you cant drive it. "Driverless cars" still need a person to take over when in danger. It's not a driverless car if someone needs to assist it.

Google has made cars that drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars however aren't truly "driverless". They alert the person driving to take wheel when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. If the car can't do those things then its not driverless. They shouldn't make "driverless" cars if we still have to take over the wheel!

Driverless cars cause danger. The car can only handle driving functions at speeds of 25 mph! This can cause car accidents with faster moving cars. The slow speed of 25 mph can aslo cause traffic jam. The driverless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. What if the person isn't alert ? This was cause accidents. Companies need to stop making "driverless" cars because they cant do things alone. They need a human driver! There's no point for having driverless cars.

It is riduculous having a car that drives its self and then asking for the drivers help when it needs it. It is riduculous how many sensors the car has to WARN you. Is it not safe since it has so many senors ? The sensor can break or mess up and cause a crash. It is riduculous that people are even making these cars.

In my conclusion driverless cars are a waste of time. The safest way to be out on the road is having the driver under all control and doing what needs to be done. Driverless cars will cause danger and the driver would want to blame the car.
