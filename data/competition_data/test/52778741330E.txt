Driveless cars shouldnt be allowed there a bad sign of bad luck to anyone who drives them at all. They are also not safe even though some people think they are. Think about it why would you want a car if your not really driving it??? What type of sense does that make thats the whole point of having a car and your license is to drive your car. If your not driving it then you should have it its really a waste of money if you buy it. Driveless cars are a bad idea and there not safe.

First of all they can cause a wreck and as it said in the article if somebody gets into a wreck who can they blame it on. The driver, or the car who knows who acually did it. And what if its the cars fault what if it catchs a glicth or something. What if the car has a glicth and blows up who's fault is that the person who made it right??? Who's gonna pay for the persons funneral if they so happen to die.

No one knows you see regular cars dont catch glitch. Regular cars dont drive there selfs because the person behind the wheel drives the car not the other way around. Thats the whole point of them making a car is for transportation but what is the point of having a machine drive you around and thats the whole point of you buyin it. Is for you to have fun driving it if you make driveless cars then teenagers are going to think that they dont need a license to drive a car. There going to get in the car and let the car drive them around.

Theres no fun in buying the car if you cant drive it thats why you bought the car. Whats the point in getting your license if your not the one driving. And also if you havent noticed your putting your life in the hands of a machine. Also 90 mph is fast if you didnt know 90 mph can kill somebody in a mature of seconds if that car gets a glicth.

This whole idea should just go out the window because it cost alot of money to build a car. And now by them trying to build a car that can drive itself is going to cost even more money. Also what if a old person is driving the car and they see the windsheild wipers blink. That could cause and accident real quick who knows whats going or in there head when they see that they could get scared and start swerving. And these are some reasons why they shouldnt make driveless cars.
