Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that having a grade B average is actually a good idea. I think it is because having good grades to me is more important than playing in sports. Most kids wont become a professional at sports and it probably wont help them in the future as much as it would good grades. Even though sports are fun and keep people in good shape, requiring a grade B average to play in sports would encourage most of the students to get their grades up. And having good grades and being an athlete means you are dedicated and probably smart. And if there are star athletes that don't have at least a B average I'm sure that they would get their grades up to continue playing sports. Also if the students with a lower average of a B want to stay in shape, that will encourage them to get their grades up and do better in school.

I like sports to and I'm definitely not against them but the grades are going to get you a good job and a good life in the future, unless you can become a pro but that's hard to accomplish. So I think that this idea would be helpful and make our community a better and smarter place and that we should use this idea.
