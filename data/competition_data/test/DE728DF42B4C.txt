Principals are like the alphas in a school. Everything the principal says, you have to do. My principal decided for every student at the school to be in a activity, or in other words, a club. I agree with this offer because it can give kids opportunities, help them try something new, and be able to fit in a group or student body.

Doing fun things is awesome right? i dont know anybody who likes to stay home and do nothing all day. There are many opportunities out in the world but the principal is trying to bring in even more. Things that you like to do can be in a activity the school has. The activities can probably have big offers. For example, an art club. An Art Club is very artistic. The club draws, paints, and learns different things you've never known about art. The teacher says, one day, that there will be a competition for the best drawing. The competition can help you get better and learn new things. What artist doesn't want to have that big opertunitie? Not only does art have opportunities but other activities do too. For example the student council. the student council helps with fun raising and school activities. If you ever wanted to be in charge of something, you could sign up! that could be a great opertunitie for you.

Learning and trying things is cool right? Sometimes, you can get tired of what you like and what your doing, so you move on to the thing you were into before, to another. Trying new things can help you learn how to do things you havn't even tried. For example, in the movie "High School Musical", a boy named Generic_Name loves basketball. He is the team captain and everyone knows who he is. Everyday he practices and gets tired of shooting the same ball into a the same hoop. He goes to school the next day and see's a play is having try outs. Though he has never sang before, He wants to try and see if hes good at it. Doing different things that you normally do is perfectly fine. Not everyone likes the same thing all the time. Learning new things can get you to try even more new things. I've tried it before as well. For example, a girl named Generic_Name is a dancer and wants to take a break from it. Her feet hurt and she thinks she can pull of something else. Her school has many activities and she tries out for the soccer team. Never be afraid to do knew things.

Not everyone is in a certain group or activity. there are students in the world who think they dont fit in and have low self esteem. This offer from the principal can help you fit in a group. These activities can help you make new friends. Making new friends is amazing and you can be proud to say your in a group and have many friends. For example, A girl named Generic_Name is quiet at school. She always has her head down when she walks in the hallways. she never smiles nor talks. one day, the principal gives an announcement about every student being in at least one activity or club. She first say she doesn't want to do it, but tries anyways. In the club she picked, she meets new people and feels happy to be apart of something. this offer can bring you smiles to your faces everyday, Though these activities might not be everyday, you can say proudly and loudly, that you feel like you fit in. Another example is that a boy named Generic_Name has multiple friends. one day his friends leave him and he feels alone. He doesnt think he fits in. he feels like he doesnt want to go to school anymore. when he goes to school, he sees all of the activities that are on a big board. he signs up for a musical and meets new friends. fitting in is a good thing. These activities can help you with so much

Principals are helping everywhere around the world. they try there best to make learning fun and create new things like clubs and activities. the principal says every student needs to be in at least one club or activity. though some students dont agree, I do. What the principal is offering is valuable because it can give kids new opportunities in what they like and they can do things they have never done before. It can also help you fit in to a place that you think you wont be able too. every principal is very hard working and i think with this offer, it will bring students together and smiles on all of the students faces.
