Well i myself STUDENT_NAME

think that all thee Principal's should allow all students to bring cell phones to school an use them during lunch an other free time , as long as they have there phones off during class time. Myself would think that us student should be allowed cell phones because, maybe the student walk home, ride a bus or even maybe the school is on lock down etc. That way student will be able to get a hold of somebody in case something horrible has happen.

Then after all when school comes around student should turn there cell phone off or on silent during class, because you have to get your Education!! Your most important thing when your at school is too get your education an not too get distracted on your cellular when you are at school .

But also still allow them at school. so that's what i would do if i was ever a principal at a school!
