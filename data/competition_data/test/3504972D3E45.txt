The author of this article says that it is a worthy pursuit to explore Venus. And they are right. Venus is much like Earth with its density and size so why not explore it.

The author explains that Venuis might have been just like Earth years ago and scientists have thought about going back to explore. The text said,"Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." What this is saying is that scientist could make new discoveries that could change everything and that scientists should absolutly go back to this planet.

The author also said that this exploration can be dangerous. The conditions on this planet are hostile. The planet is very hot and the atmosphere pressure is much greater than on Earth. The text said," A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percetn carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." What this is trying to say is that this is extremely dangerous for humans. But this still doesn't make it impossible for people to explore. NASA has a possible solution to battle the conditions of this planet. They might create a hovering vehicle that would stay above the ground. The text says," NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Vesusian landscape." What this is saying is that there is a chance people can go find new discoveries on Venus.

In conclusion it is possible but dangerous to explore this planet because we have technology to help us through the hostile conditons of this planet.
