Do you like the feeling of being told no to because you could not play sports? Its because your grades weren't good or because you cant play that good. Well we should be able to play sports with a C average cause at lease we are passing still. I think that the policy should change because kids could be really good at sports and u will never know until you let them play and see. C's are passing grades to me and my family but there not that great either cause u still need to pull them up and try and get a better grade before school gets out or u will be going to summer school.

Students who have C's want really like school that much cause they cant do there favorite things. School is not just about education its about doing what you want so that you can live the life you want. If you want to have a sports job like football, soccer or basketball, your going to have to start while your young. Students who make C's are still passing but they should be able to play sports still and have a life outside of school.

They might be good at sports and the coach might want them on the team but they cant cause of a C, that's not right they should be able to play cause like i said a C is not that bad at least there passing. Students with B's might not want to play sports and then if the students with C's does then they should be able to. The students are good either way but i could see if there all ways getting into trouble then they should not be able to play.

If the students that have C's and are constantly in trouble and gets more than 3 referrals then they should not be able to play. If the are good and they stay out of trouble then why cant they play sports. They should be able to participate in whatever they want.

This is why i am arguing against this because they are staying out of trouble and still passing the classes with a C average. So you should change the policy to because kids are good at sports and your not going to give them the opportunity to do so. Then they might even bring up there grades while playing sports.
