Some believe that is better to teach children at home whereas the majority of people believe that it is highly recommended to send them to school for their better development. In my opinion it is more appropriate to send students to school instead of teaching them at home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes because it can be motivated, and distance learning is not good because it would make cheating easier, there would be less social interaction, ad they would need to be highly motivated.

One of the biggest advantages of go to school is to improve their social capacity. Students will develop social skill when they are admitted to school by interacting with their teachers and classmates. Because they come from diverse family background and have different financial statements, students tend to learn a lot from each other and more likely to realize. For example, to name a few, a bout other religions or moral practices of his peers or they can learn the habits of dressing or the way of talking about his peers.

Secondly, the growth and development of the students is assessed on a regularly basis by conducting tests, homework in a school in this area of high competition among schools to gain popularity, this process will have impact on students will make them ready to sustain in the really changeling world. For example in this area they can prove their learning, ability, and dedication.

On the contrary, teaching children at homo also has few advantages. If students are taught at home, with full attention and focus on the child, he is more likely to understand the subject well. Secondly, student can be taught in a more amicable way and be more comfortable when they are accompanied by their family at home. But they not make new friends or socialize with different people. Also some parents do not always have the time to supervise their children for that reason it is better that they go to school to receive better supervise and education.

In conclusion, both approaches have their own advantages, but sending the student to school will make him more successful in his life, while teaching him at home may result lower rates for education, but he will not be competent in the world. Also attend to school make the student stronger with more benefits to share with the world and their improve their social capacity with other people.
