You should join the program because you can help people and animals. You can travel across the country and get to see many animals in the ocean! If you join you get to love the people you help and love the animals you help! You also get to have fun on the boat you are on traveling on, like play table tennis, vollyball, boxing, and more!

Luke Bomberger set the world record for going on nine trips. See, you can do that to if you join the Seagoing Cowboys. You can change peoples lifes just like Luke Bomberger did to the people he helped. Luke said that it opened the world to him because of the things he did to change the people's lives. It made him aware of the things going on in this world and it can make you aware of what is going on in the world too.

In-conclusion, always want to do what Luke Bomberger did, join the Seagoing Cowboys program, and help many of people and animals. That is why I would join the Seagoing Cowboys, to help as many people as I can and set a world record of 12 trips! Also to help children, and parents get through of what they loss in the war! That is my opinion of Seagoing Cowboys!
