Technology gets a lot of backlash, but in reality it is our friend. Technology empowers and teachus us. Without it, we wouldn't be as informed of the world as we are now. For this reason, advanced technology should continue to be used. Introducing the FACS technology in schools would be valuable because it would create a more beneficial enviornment for everyone: society and individuals alike.

Implementing the Facial Action Coding System into schools would be very valuable for society as a whole. The article states that the software provides the exact emotions of someone. For example, the machine might declare that someone is "83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry." (paragraph 1) Teens' actions related to their emotions are still fairly unknown, so having this information on adolescents in particular would help us be able to identify the root of the emotions later on. It's clear that FACS would seriously benefit science.

Perhaps the most important reason for going through with this technology is that people would be more honest with each other at school. Enabling teachers and students alike to see how others are feeling would create a distinct openness in the school. Students would no longer feel that they have to put on a "happy face," (as the article mentions in paragraph 9) when they're sad. There would be no point for this deception, since FACS would see right through it. People who felt sad could be comforted by others. Students would be more happy than they are now, at the end of a long school day. Having the FACS technology in schools would create an enviornment of honesty and happiness.

It's true that having a machine see right through you would take some getting used to. But this unsettling feeling is overcome by the fact that this technology benefits science and our enviornments in a huge way. It makes us into a better people, so the question is, why would we not go through with it?
