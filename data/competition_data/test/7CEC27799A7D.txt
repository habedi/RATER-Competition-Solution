The author believes that there is a spark of curiosity of wanting a safe way to travel to Venus and has included that NASA has new technology to make that happen.

The author states that Venus is the only planet that is close enough to be another Earth. A long time ago Venus was a lot like Earth. It had mountains, valleys, and probably had some oceans covering its surface as well. Astronomers are amazed at how Venus was once able to carry forms of life, they want to explore Venus in a safe manner. If NASA is able to make that happen then why wouldn't anyone want to explore and find out, more closely, of what it is like today.

Another reason Venus should be explored is that NASA has been reasearching and testing new ways to make a safe travel. They have come up with a "blimp-like vehicle" that would be able to hover above Venus's dangerous landscape. With a device like this NASA would be able to do reasearch on informaton that they have been longing to know. It's a safe and efficient way to explore our neighboring planet.

The "blimp-like vehicle" is an amazing idea but it will only be able to provide some light on what the conditions are like on the ground. NASA has accepted this but has not given up, they have decided to find another way to get more information. Silicon carbide electronics have been tested to see if it can manage Venus's standards. Unlike the spacecrafts that lasted less than a few hours, these electronics have lasted weeks.

In conlusion, the author has included that NASA has found many new ways to ensure a safe travel to Venus. He states that you have to look beyond the dangers and find ways around it. He believes that with all the new technology coming out and new ideas that traveling to Venus safely is possible.
