Dear. Principal

I think that we should have a sign up sheet for the people that want to do the community service. For example maybe some of my friends don't want to and some of them do? Then the ones that want to can and the ones that don't then they don't have to. So that's why i think we should have a sign up sheet.

Another one could be have a vote to see how much people want to do community service. And those people can do community service and the ones that don't want to do community service don't have to. And everyone is happy for what they don't have to do community service or wants to do community service. And the people who do wants to do community service just have to tell them the information like what to do where to meet at and what time to what time. And that's why i think we should have a vote in every class.
