Dear Principal,

Have you ever played sports? If you have then you know how hard your coach expects you to work. So, I think that making each student have a B average isn't such a bad idea. If a student cannot keep a B average, then the student shouldn't be playing a sport anyway.

First, when playing a sport, you should know that school and grades always come first. It doesn't matter how good you are or if you like school or not. I play three sports, baseball, football, and basketball, and I still maintain straight A' s. In fact, I have never had a B. So, having to have a B average is a great Idea.

Second, sports are good for you because they keep you in shape. But there is something else, if you want to go to college or have a decent job in your future, then grades are more important. I am not saying kids should quit sports, because many love playing. I am saying that kids playing sports should have a tutor or extra help in class if they need it. They aren't receiving special treatment, they just have a lot going on.

Lastly, you were a kid once, and you know how the athletic kids are most likely the cool kids. So, maybe you or the counselor need to talk to them and explain how much more important grades are than sports. A lot of the players don't realize that, if there was a study session before games or practice, and they did it as a team, then they would improve a lot. Most kids, when working together rather than alone will do twice as good. So if I were you, I would make them work for a B average, but I would also do other things like study sessions also.

I know you were a kid once, so bring it to the kids realization that grades are more important. You need to put forth some effort, and they will too. Then maybe in the future, you can get even more help for them and raise the standards to an A average. You should really make the students work. Thank you, and I think that the students like the idea or having a B average.

Sincerely,
