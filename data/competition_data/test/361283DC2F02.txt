Since the development of cars, cars have been used as the main transportation used by people. However, even though there are many advantages of using a car, there are many advantages of limiting car usage. There are many advantages of limiting car usage, such as walking and public transportation, less pollution, and results of this.

One main advantage of limiting car usage would be the ability to walk around and not have to find parking spaces. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, author of

In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars , the author wrote, "In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway" (Rosenthal, Lines 45-47). Rosenthal also wrote that public transportation was another option instead of using a car by stating, "But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attemps to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking" (Rosenthal, Lines 42-45). Walking and public transportation have been useful alternatives of using a car.

As walking and using public transportation have been an advantage of limiting car use, another advantage would be less pollution. For cities like Paris, pollution in the air is a big problem, so the Paris government have enforced pollution in the air. Robert Duffer, author of

Paris bans driving due to smog , the author stated, "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" (Duffer, Lines 1-2). The author also wrote that, "On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day" (Duffer, Lines 3-6). Paris suffered great pollution due to cars, so it would be an advantage of limiting car usage to reduce the amount of pollution in the world.

As a result of limiting car usage, many different countries, such as Colombia and America have reduced their car usage. In Andrew Selsky's

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , the author stated that in Bogota, Colombia, "millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams" (Selsky, Lines 2-5). The author also wrote that "The goal is to promot alternative transportation and reduce smog" (Selsky, Lines 8-9). The author also included a quote businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said, "It's a good opportunity to take away stree and lower air pollution" (Selsky, Lines 15-16). While in America, author Elisabeth Rosenthal of

The End of Car Culture , wrote that "recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by" (Rosenthal, Lines 4-6). The author also wrote a quote of Michael Sivak (who's a professor and studies trends at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute), "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn" (Rosenthal, Lines 29-31). The author also wrote that "If the pattern persists-and many sociologists belive it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions" (Rosenthal, Lines 36-40). The driving also stated that "Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license" (Rosenthal, Lines 64-67). Rosenthal also stated that "a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009" (Rosenthal, Lines 84-85). There have been many results due to limiting car usage in many different countries around the world, such as Colombia and America.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage, such as walking and using public transportation so there wouldn't be a problem finding a parking space, there would be less pollution, and in return, it would make the world a better place.
