School has always been a working concept of life where grades and social circles ruled 9 out of the 12 months of the year, and summer is a welcome break from that work. Though, to continue student learning, some schools require summer assignments to be completed by the end of that break. The question is, should teachers design those assignments, or should students? Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they more thoroughly understand the information that will be taught next year and, between them and the students, teachers have the most experience in organizing and preparing assignments.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they have the best understanding of what is to come next year, so they know what to prepare the students for. You would feel completely lost and unprepared if the information you studied during the summer was wrong, or if you didn't have any information at all. Good teachers also collaborate well with others so they'll know what to expect for the future, also supporting summer assignments should be created by teachers.

Teachers should design summer assignments because they have the most experience in organizing, preparing, and selecting assignments. Teaching is their job, so they understand the limits their of students, sometimes better than the students themselves. They grade their tests, homework, classwork, extra credit etc. and they answer questions, give advice, and help out even when they weren't asked to. They also can figure out which assignments go to which students, because they know that everyone is on a different academic level and should be given a fair chance at completing the assignment.

Some say that teachers may have more experience, but the students are the ones that will need to complete these assignments with a most-likely full schedule during the summer, and they know their strengths and weaknesses far better than the teachers, so they should be the ones designing the assignments. Well, teachers also go on summer break so they understand the busy schedules and the need for vacation time as well as students. Also, as a huge portion of their job is to be in a classroom full of students, teachers may be able to understand a student's strengths and weaknesses fairly quickly and understand how to explain something to them. That's why certified adults should be the ones to handle summer assignments, not kids who are in school because they haven't learned all the necessary information that teachers already know.
