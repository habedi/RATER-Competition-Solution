I think the hazerds of venus is the major earthquakes and erupting volcanoes and beyond high pressure heat, such as the temperatures are up too 800 degrees fahrenhiet. on peragraph 5 of NASA thinks that the air pressure would be close to sea level on earth but solar power would be plentiful, and the radiation would not exceed earth levels, not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

I think what NASA is trying to test if any vechles would land seccuessfuly on this planet because due to the conditions of earthquakes, eruopting volvanoes and high pressure heat, some dont succed while they try to land or make it too venus, so what i think there doing is testing metal, or other powerful materials to make it on venus and see if everything like natural life would grow, for an example on planet mars they test it they could grow plants and beacsue they saw a little bit of water and clouds on planet mars, so maybe since venus is the nearest to planet earth maybe we could test it to see if it would grow.

Fun fact venus is the closest planet to earth terms of density and size, and it could not be a threat just because its the 2sec of the sun.
