Dear Principal,

I believe the policy of allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a good policy. I think this for many reasons, like if there was an emergency at school, or if they need something brought in from home, and lastly to let parents know of cancellations without having to use the schools phone.

My first reason was that if there was an emergency at school, like a fire or any other emergency that could happen during the school day. Students would then be able to let their parents know they are safe. If other emergencies would happen, the students would be able to call police or anything else that might need done that adults might not be able to get to.

My second reason is that if the students need something brought in from home, many students forget things and don't want to bother asking to use the schools phone. It would create less hassle for the school, and make it easier for the students.

My third and final reason why students should be aloud to bring phones to school is because parents would need to know about cancellations of any after school activities, So they knew their children were at home and not a practice so they wouldn't have to get them at school.

That is why I believe that students should be aloud to bring phones to school. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you think about my opinion on which policy is better.

Sincerely,

Student
