In this article we are talking about the FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) and how it could read students' emotional expression. At first this article was talking about the Mona Lisas' facial expression and how she's 83 percent happy, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

This would benifit the classroom by letting the teachers know what makes them instrasted in the classroom. When you look tierd and about to sleep the teacher will try and do something different to help you pay attantion. Just like speaking in a different tone or walking around the classroom to get someone's attantion.

Us humans do the same thing as-well just like easily looking at someones face on a date or in a classroom to she either they like you or they don't like the way your expressing yourself. It would also help if your in a room full of strangers and wanting to get to know them but you can't really know what to say or if they would like the conversation.

What the computer does when they are calculating a face is that they compare it with a neutral face. Just by using video imagery, the new emoion- recogition software to track the facial movements. There are facial expressions for each emotion on your face but even tho individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

All in all this invention would be amazing to have. You can use it on students and see if there instrasted in a subject and how well the teacher's behavior effects them as well. You can use it on some painting to see what they were feeling while they were getting drawn.
