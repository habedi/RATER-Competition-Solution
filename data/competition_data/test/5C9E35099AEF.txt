Just imagine, the cool summer air, blowing on your face as you and your friends play outside getting the vitamin D you need. Oh,now imagine seeing all of this from the inside of your house because your history teacher made you read a whole textbook so you could write a 6000 word essay and presentation by the end of summer. Now imagine you writing an essay for that same history teacher, but about a World War 2 museum that you went to with you family and friends,that could be a possibility. The students learn and the teacher gets a project, a win win. That is why students should be the ones who design the summer projects to provide student with a fun summer break, but have the teachers feel confident that their students still know the knowledge they left with or even learn something new.

When a student gets a project that has a set of guidelines and no room for creativity, the student can feel bored and not want to do the project to their best ability. This is because all they would have to do is just answer a question, write a couple paragraphs and then they are done. This can't prove what a person has learned because they could easily copy and friend, find the answers online, or have someone who may know what the teachers wants then they can just use that person to make the project an A+. If a student designed the project, then the student can show what they know and what they learned over the school year, but also see how that topic can be introduced in the real world.

Projects are teachers ways of getting a easy grade from the kids and to really tell if a student knows the subject. Lets say that there is a student who wasn't in class a lot for different reasons,but caught up throughout the year because they did the easiest way to get by. The project for the summer was a topic that he got a good grade on only because he learned the whole thing before he test. Then fails the project because it was on something that was out of their control, but if they could have made the project themselves, he could get a much better grade and still show the teacher that they are not confident on that topic,but knows the other needed topics. This is a win win to the student and teacher, so that both can have a good, stress less summer.

Teachers always say that "knowledge is forever if you really know it", but what do you say for a topic you learned all year, worked so hard to get, took notes every class, and some how when the teacher wants you to show what you know in a project that they made, it comes up a little short. All student learn different, some are really good at remembering dates,people, or events, and some know the topic, but don't know how to explain it in the teachers words. The projects that teachers give to see if you remember anything from class cater to the 1% of kids who can give the teacher everything that they want on that project just as the teacher wants. Yet the rest of the student who know the topic, but can not explain it the way the teacher wants get left behind. Some student can write a whole essay about why the French Revolution happened, some can make a cartoon about the same thing, but the student with the cartoon can't turn their project in because the teacher wanted an essay. Its things like that for projects over the summer to be designed by the student and not the teacher.

Overall, students should be allowed to make the summer projects because it is for them too. It also shows what they don't know out of a subject or topic and it can help them get better too. It also makes the projects fun because then again, it is a summer project, kids want to enjoy there summer and not have to think of all the time they spent on a project that they don't care about and have no say in. If the student can have fun with the project then they will remember the topic even more because they can remember how much fun they had doing it and will remember the important parts on when they know and the teacher can have fun seeing what the student has accomplished. Both want to enjoy their summers, right?

Some schools are requiring student to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during break. Teachers are creating this projects for the students and sending them on their way. Students are wasting the little time they have to just relax and be a kid on projects that could make no sense to them. This is why students should be the ones who design the summer projects to provide student with a fun summer break, but have the teachers feel confident that their students still know the knowledge they left with or even learn something new.
