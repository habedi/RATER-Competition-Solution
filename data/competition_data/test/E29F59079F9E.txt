Driving less is a good way to help ourselfs and our enviornment. Peaople are turning to it because it helps with stress to walk,and our cities air is as pulluted.

Cars are very harmful to the air and everyone around us cars set out green housae gases that are very harmfiul "12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car;intensive areas in the united states" (In German Suburb,life goes on withcars Rosenthal).If the usage of cars are limited traffic jams will happen les the they are "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france" (Paris bans driving due to smog Duffer).Due to more for the people in Columbia having a no car day and walking threw the cities they put more stores which means more buiness.

"Americans are buying fewer cars,drving less and getting fewer licenses" (the end of car culture Rosenthal)the message is getting out for no more greenhouse gases effecting our enviornment. Even young people are getting involed in the no car situtation "study last year found that driving by young decreased 23 percent 2001 and 2009" (the end of car culture Rosenthal).The limited use is so affective other countries and its citites are getting involved "for the first time, two other Colombian citites , Cali and Valledupar joined the event" (car-free day is spinninh into a big hit in bogota Selsky).

Driving less is a advantage we have to keep things less polluted and greener and not try to mess up the place we live in by using cars. Walking is a very good way to get places no pulltion and more health.
