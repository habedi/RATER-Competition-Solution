Dear Principle,

I'm writing this letter to let you know that performing community service is a good idea to have the students get to take care of the environment. Students think that community service is a waste of their time. It's as if it takes away the time they need to do, like go with friends and go crazy or keeps them away from playing their games. Cleaning up the community is very important to those who love a clean community and like to help others. When i would go play at parks I would se a lot of trash everywhere so I started to pick up the trash until it looked clean. I love this community OUR community that we live in but how can I when we live in a dump with trash everywhere.

The point is that I want the students to take part of this service and help the care of others and help care for the environment they live including the other people that live in this environment. This will allow them to care for the environment and love it as I do. This can't go any further and I know trash will keep on coming but we are there to pick it up for the environment. So get as many kids to help clean this environment we live in for the health and care of the rights of other people. That's why we should as the school perform this service.

sincerely,

Student of this school
