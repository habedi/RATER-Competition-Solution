As a way to start I'm going to ask a question. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? My answer is very simple and I'll explain why. My answer is no of course not. In the next few paragraphs I'll tell you why students wouldn't benefit from online courses.

Firstly, students would spend most of their time at home playing video games ,taking naps,etc. By the time they do the online course sure the take notes,pay attention,do the work needed to do,but the online course dose not last a whole 2 hours or hour and a half like in school classes do. In my uncles experience in high school, he said that he would always spend half the day eating,sleeping,or playing video games,while the other half was either working or hanging out with friends. My uncle didn't worry about his online course because he thought they don't take long so he can do it whenever he can. Consequently, he didn't graduate on time and had to take the class in school during the summer.

Secondly, some students won't get the necessary knowledge they need. A 45 minute online course isn't enough time to explain all type of data that is needed in order to pass the class. Most online courses, if you don't take the class in school, are required for you to graduate in high school. In my experience, I take Personal Finance and the website where we learn the information is called Virtual Business. Each topic lasts only for 45 minutes or less. Although it is still a long time, it's still not enough to inform us about the topic/class.

Lastly, in many schools it is not recommended to take online courses. For instance,in Generic_School a student counselor told a friend of mine that unless he was responsible and could be able to keep up with the course it was a great opportunity. In a similar case I also talked to my counselor but this time the school was Generic_School. In my situation I was told that this wasn't a great idea to take an online course since I can't manage my time well and it was a risk I was willing to take. Unfortunately, I wish I hadn't taken the class because now I am at risk at not graduating on time.

In conclusion, I do not believe that students would benefit attending classes from home because most of the time the student won't get their work done or not have time. In addition, students could have an instructor helping them druing school while in online courses you have to figure it out yourself. Sometimes online courses have their benefits but most of the time they don't.
