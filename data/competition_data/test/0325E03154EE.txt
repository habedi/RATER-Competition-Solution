Do you believe that there were living animals on planet Mars? In this propmt I will tell you why I believe the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform.

Some people would like to belive that there were once human like creatures living on the Red Planet. Also known as Mars. They believe that the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens. As stated in paragraph 1 it says Viking 1 has spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face as it was looking for possible landing sites for VIking 2. That does't truly mean that there were aliens living there. Many people may say they have expierenced aliens. But have they really?

I believe that the "Face on Mars" is just a simple natural landform. In paragraph 8 it states that it is a very cloudy time in the month of April for the Red Planet. If no one belives that then possibly they could check again. It is very difficlut to scan a planet. More than difficlut, it is a job that will take a certain amount of time, but it is sometimes worth it. I don't believe that aliens are real. I also don't belive that Mars is a Planet that is to be liveable on. In paragraph 1 it says the "Face on Mars" was an "enormouse head that was nearly two miles for end to end."

This is why I believe that the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. There are many other reasons why I think this, but the ones that I have stated are more likely to be understaning to one another.
