I agree with the principals decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, if the students don't do least one extracurricular activity, they won't know what they want to do when they'll become older and responsible for example, if a student did sports as one of their extracurricular activity, then maybe when they grow up, they would want to join a sports team or play a sport for a job or start a new carrier. Another example, one of the students choose two extracurricular activity, art and the other was learning about computers, that gives them more opportunities to see what they are going to do when they get older, they could do both, and have better job opportunities. At the age when your going into high school, you need to be focused in school and focused on your grades and choose a good extracurricular activity so you know what your going to be experiencing when you choose a job that you think will be good for you, and will enjoy. But if a student dosen't choose a extracurricular activity then they won't know what they'll do when they grow up and get older. they probably wont have a good job because they didnt choose a extracurricular activity when they should have in high school. But overall students should choose an extracurricular activity because it will cause a big impact in their life if they take a extracurricular activity.
