NASA is fighting to be alble to to go to Venus . They have been researching diffrent methods on how to sustaine life on the planet . In the text it says that "Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers but should be expanded .."(8) Yes we are trying to figer out our planet earth still but there may be diffrent ways we can help explore the ocean and lower in the earths core .

We have never been affriad of danger and we always try and try again . with the man on the moon and rovers on mars. NASA has been coming up with an idea on how we are going to the hostile planet."Venuse would allow scientists to float above the fray . Imagine a blimp like vehicle hoveroring over venus 30 or so miles above the rolling vensian landscape."(5)Even if it not on the planets surface as close as we get is good progress and we have presisted with danger still in the path in front of us .

NASA

has gotten us far with one big idea .So planets like venuse are always worthy pursiting with all the dangers .
