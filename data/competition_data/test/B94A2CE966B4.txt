Venus or

Earth. What if there was an oppertunity to live somewhere else? Not just leave the city, the state or even the country. The world, what if there was any chance to leave and go to Venus, and start new? By the end of this hoepfully that will be an easy decision.

To start it off, "Evening Star" is what is said about one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, how could you pass up seeing something like that? Just can't, right? That's why the author of this passage wrote this. The physical characteristics of Venus are absoutley gorgous, considering the fact that it never hurts to ask. Why else would people want to go to Venus, that's not what it's all about but it helps. In the passage the author states, "The planethas a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such has valleys, mountains, and craters." This quote will open peoples eyes to hopefully realize how close our worlds can relate to one another and they can start to think into depth about Venus.

Secondly, approches for Venus, to possibily get human life on there to reseach about the different conditions and atmosphere there. In the passage it says, "Silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surfact and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." This shows that the technology is improving which would be amazing for the author, considering it could help this mission be successful. "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flecible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions." This shows how fast the technology is changing and improving. Things will be easier to communicate on as well as be in better conditions to take on Venus.

Last but not least, the author talks about fear, or being limited and when you are as passionate as he is about these possibilities that have come along, thats the best feeling. You have to put fear aside sometimes, because they aren't always fears, half the time they are excuses and that is why you should always believe in the things your passionate about, they'll keep you going and on your toes. It's good to be pssionite.

On the other hand, even though Venus is a beautiful planet, has come along way with research and is something the author is passionate about, doesn't always mean that it is the safest, or best decision for everybody, overall. In the passage the author stated many things had have made Venus seem bad, but really it is things that we can not control, but that doesn't stop him. He goes on to talka about the difficult times with this particular story. He talks about how each mission was, "Unmanned, because no spacecrft survived the landing for more than a few hours, 800 degrees Fahrenheit, hottest planet in our solar system, and the geology presents with erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land." These are the very things we have to consider in our decisons without letting them get away from us. This passage is all about fianlly exploring the planet most like ours, and there are great risks, which could end badly, but with this author and the way he writes, it's not that he doesn't care about the risks it's that he is not letting fear get in the way of his passion. The Venus exploration is up to each individual.

The author supported his claim very clearly as well as expressed all of the risks. The research about Venus could never hurt, all it could do was give us, the world more information about something we can't know for ourselves. The author expressed his claim very clearly to his audiance, as well as not letting his own belifs get in the way of the overall passage.
