I think kids can bring their cell phones to school because if they had to call their dad or mom as long as kids dont use their phones in class because its not good your mined shoulder be on school work not your cell phone and plus i heard about cyberbullys they use their phones to talk to other people so they can just bother u so cell phones for me u can bring them just don't use them in school because it well get u in alto of problem's in school that's why theirs lots of talking in school about how to use your cell phone some one can track u down and u would it even no and they well fined where u live so be caerfule who u give your number to u wont no want they can do to u just tack care of your phone who u give your number to and don't use them in class rooms or in school its just better that why because people can get heart and those kids can do some think crazy at school like kill them selfless at school just because some one was bulling them i had a fronded that want it me to kill him just because some one was bullying them i did` t thou soon we fond who it was it was some kid we went to school with when we where younger in the day i think kids should just levee their cell phones at home so they wont get them tack in up and then u going to have to pay 15$ just so u can get them back so i don't even use my cell phones at school and u should it use your cell phones at school either i dont think that we have to pay are own cell phones just to get it back thats the part i dont like u got to pay 15$ to get your cell phone back
