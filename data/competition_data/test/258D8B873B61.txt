This is something that could come in handy when the person driving is not paying full attention to the road. The car also alerts you when it is need of human skills. These features make driverless cars safer than regular cars.

Driverless cars are equipped with more technology and better features than regular cars. In the article it states that some car manufacturers are hoping to bring entertaiment and information systems into the car. These systems will make sure that a person doesn't get bore while the car is doing the driving itself. Another thing is that the entertainment features will turn off when trying to alert you. These technological features make smart cars unique and fun.

Now compare a smart car to a regular car. Which car seems better? The smart car of course! Our world is improving things everyday and smart cars are one of those things. Why not give these driverless cars a chance.
