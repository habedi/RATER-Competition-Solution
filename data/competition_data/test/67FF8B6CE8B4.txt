Phones & Driving

In 2015, the United States started to focus on the problem that was phone use while driving. Distracted driving has taken many innocent lives. According to enddd. com 37,416 lives were lost in 2016 due to distracted driving. No matter how much the death rate rises people still use their phones while operating a vehicle. Most people have the argument that having a phone mounted so they could have two hands on the wheel eliminates the problem. However, the level of danger is still high. There are opinions that the use of cell phones while driving have little to no negative effects, but there is much more compelling evidence that it is a serious hazard to be distracted while driving.

While driving with other motorist around, it is imperative to keep all focus on the road. The smallest mistake could lead to a major accident including people that were not involved. In 2012 alone, 3,328 people were killed in distracted driving crashes, a number that continues to go up (Distraction. Gov). As technology advances they rate of distracted driving increasing. It has been uncovered that people between the ages of 18 and 25 have the highest rates of distracted driving. Text messaging creates a crash risk 23 times worse than driving while not distracted (Distraction. Gov).

On the contrary, it is understood that a phone might need to be used in a state of emergency. However, answering to an emergency can cause one of your own. Imagine being in a state of panic and stress with the addition of cell phone use while driving. Now there is another state of peril. It's better to get to the emergency than not getting there at all.

In conclusion, people are still being severely injured and even killed because of drivers distracted by phones. People walk through and across the streets scared for their lives, wondering if they will make it to their destination. How many deaths must occur before people realize how dangerous their actions can be? No one will ever know the real answer How many children are going to have to lose their parents, or for that matter, how many parents are going to have to lose their children before this danger can be stopped? No one will ever know the answer. All that can be done, as of now, is to try the best ways that can be done.
