Chemistry, math, arts, computers, designing the list goes on, in what extracurricular activities you can join! School is a great way to learn, do fun things that interest you, hang out with your friends, and just be you. I think that we should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Because, you can make new friends, do fun activities, and start or join a club that interests you.

Joining sports teams and clubs are a great way to make friends that have the same interests as you do. When you play sports in my opinion, you can have so much fun and you exercise at the same time! If, you don't like any sports that's okay you could do any club you would like. You can also ask the principle you could probably make your very own club with your friends!

Clubs are ways you can express yourself and take your mind off of things. You can do fun activities like arts and crafts where you can design our yearbook, paint/color, 3D arts, animation, and other things! Also, school related activities for example mathematics, science, Civics, English, Algebra, or History. You can start clubs for what you want to be when you're older! Help our school out and win decathlons or spelling bees! The list pretty much goes on. If you have an interest make a club! It's like a community were you can feel like you belong.

It should be the students call though, if they want to join a club or sport. Doing something they don't want to do is not a good idea. But, it would be a good opportunity to be apart of something. I'm honestly so glad my mom forced me to do volleyball because, I have made so many friends and started club volleyball now! I would have never thought I would do volleyball. It's a hobby now that I love and I'm going to be doing it until college!

Participating in school extracurricular activities is a good idea. This can help you decide what you want to do in life, also find new hobbies. Trying something new is very important in life. Making friends and a community were you belong is a great thing for students. That is a placed were you can just express yourself. So, that they can enjoy school even more!Â
