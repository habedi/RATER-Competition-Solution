In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" it talks about how technology is used to read human expressions. I'm going to give my opinion on technology reading students emotions. I think that it is good for us to have something like this because it will help us see what people are thinking. In the article paragraph five the author says that we could identify each others expressions but we don't really know what each one means for example being happy, sad, or angry can have different looks and we might not know what they are. The author also states that with his computer he can tell what people are thinking if they are upset or excited, who knew that one expression could mean so many things. Sometimes the muscles are used to show if a politician or celebrity is telling the truth, it can also tell if someone is doing a genuine or forced smile. That is my opinion on "Making Mona Lisa Smile" and I think it would be amazing to have.
