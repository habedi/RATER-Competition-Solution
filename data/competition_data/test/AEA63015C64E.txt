Some schools require students to complete summer projects so that they can continue learning over break. Most people think the projects should be teacher-designed. A teachers work could benefit the students in many ways, some teachers actually give out a variety of options that the students could choose from, and most students would understand the projects more. It could benefit students if they designed their own projects, but most people wouldnt think of that as a better idea, or wouldn't agree. Here's some reasons that explain this choice.

During the summer, students could forget a lot of criteria from the previous year going into the following. Thats why the teachers give out beneficial work to help keep things in mind. My personal experience with summer projects benefited me a lot. So I believe that a lot of the criteria the teachers give out will help you improve your stamina and critical thinking skills for the upcoming school year. Which could also help improve your grade in that class; if you actually do the project.

Another reason is, most teachers give out a variety of options students could choose from. Some students may worry that the project is going to be long and boring, but that's not always the case. In my personal experience, I've only gotten projects in my English classes. So therefore, everything was either writing essays, book reports, or answering questions about the books that was chosen. However, my teachers gave my classmates and I a huge variety of books to choose from so we wouldn't bore ourselves. That's most likely what most teachers would do. Every project you get isn't just long, boring reading assignments, they actually could be interesting. Either way, they do not and will not hurt you.

One more reason is, students would most likely understand the work more. If the teacher assigns something, it's going to come with thorough directions. So I would imagine students using that as an advantage. In my personal experience, the teachers always gave set directions. Therefore, I always knew what to do and how to do it. I feel like it would be more difficult if a student was to come up with their own ideas.

Most people think projects should be teacher-designed because the work could benefit students, teachers give out a variety of options to choose from, and most students would understand the criteria better, Likewise, it could benefit some students if they designed their own projects, but most people would not agree. In conclusion, my decision is set!Â
