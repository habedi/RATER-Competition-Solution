In the article " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggustion that Venus is worth studying has many thoughts in our heads. Is it really worth it? Should we consider it or focus on our planet? Well, the author has many reasons to why we should continue researching it.

A supported reason to the author belief is that it could be a back up plan for us if something were to happen to earth. in the text it says," Often referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance too" ( paragraph 2). Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. IT would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing.

Another reason is it could help us with futuristic things. Better things than what he whave right now. In the article it stated," Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. It would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing" ( paragraph 5). We can find and build different tools to help us reach Venus and to study more about what could be our future planet.

While i see the authors mindset on this article, there are many con's to the "twin" planet. Its not very survivable land for us to stay and live in. In the text it says,"

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface. ( paragraph 3). This can cause alot of damage and lots of fear within people if we were to ever live here

The article over had good reasons to back up the authors reasons to why we should continue looking into this planet.

We need to consider the pro's and co's to everything. And i think the author is headins a good way bu wanting another planet for us to live in.
