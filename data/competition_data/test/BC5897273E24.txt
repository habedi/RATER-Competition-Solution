Why Everyone Should Have to do an Extracurricular Activity

Have you ever thought of something that you might want to do outside of school, but you never got around to it? Well this new idea might help you and I will explain why this should become a rule. I think that everyone should have to do an extracurricular activity outside of school. There are plenty of reasons for this, starting with meeting new people. You could meet a whole different friend group than you are used to and really bond with them. Also, it could get your mind off something, whether it is fighting at home or being bullied at school. If you do a sport, it could help your body too. Maybe you're not happy with your appearance, weight, or strength, sports help them all. Maybe in your activity, you could help someone who is going through a tough time with family or bad grades or anything bad going on in their life. Lastly, you could learn new things like a new sport, a certain type of art, or even discover a new talent you never new you had.

First off, doing an extracurricular activity helps in so many ways starting out with meeting new people. If you can go into someplace new and make a couple of friends, then you can be able to find a safe place with the new group so you don't have to feel like theres only a handful of people you can go to for advice or help or even just have a good time. Also, making new friends that you've never met before shows that you can work well with almost anyone and not just that handful of people.

Next, it could help get your mind off something that is just not falling into place right now. Maybe you're not getting along with your parents, or a loved one died, or maybe you're even getting bullied at school. When doing an extracurricular activity, all of your fears and sorrows just drift away like you don't have a worry in the world and you can just be yourself. Sports can definitely help with this, because when you are running up and down the court and hitting a baseball as far as you can, all of the stress in your body gets let out and you feel free. This ties in with making new friends too, because your new friends can help you get your mind off that one thing that keeps bothering you.

Especially sports help with this reason, because they help improve your entire body making you feel like a whole new you. Maybe your weight is a little above what you want it to be or your arms are too weak to lift a chair. Either way sports can help with this significantly. When you run up and down the court, it gets your blood flowing and moving at a higher speed helps you loose weight. In baseball, half of the game is throwing a ball, and in order to be able to throw it hard, you have to have arm strength. This should motivate you to work to make your arm stronger by lifting weights and doing band exercises. Also, playing a sport and making your body stronger will help make your bones strong so that if you fall on an arm lets say, its less likely to break and if it does, then it won't be severe.

Relating to where I talked about the activity or a friend helping get your mind off something, you could also help someone else if they are in the same shoes as you. Maybe they are having even worse than you which might seem impossible, but it is a reality for so many people. The least you can do to help them, is be a friend to them even if they are not your first choice. Maybe the reason they are doing the activity is to find some help from someone like you. You never know what could be going on in someones life, so be that good teammate that passes the ball to them and show them how to draw something they didn't know how to.

Last but not least, you could learn something about yourself or how to do something you never knew how to but always wanted to learn. I've always been a baseball and basketball player but maybe if we had to choose a new activity to do, then I could choose another sport like soccer or tennis. Maybe even, I could branch out and try something that's not a sport like art or possibly learn something that I could do that I never knew I could, like play guitar. That would be the beauty of the new rule, learning something new about yourself that could last you a lifetime and maybe even make you some money one day.

Yes, these after school activities can take up a lot of your free time, but when you are doing/playing them, it should be so fun that it feels like it is your free time. But if you can come out of an activity with at least one new friend and some peace of mind it should all be worth the time. Myself, I have done many extracurricular activities in my life which include mission trips with church, boy scouts, sports, and many others. For instance, the past two years my mom and I have gone with the church to a mission trip in St. Lucia. This has probably been the most special activity to me, because we got to work with kids from the age of four, all the way through the age of fourteen. The St. Lucia trips were so special to my mom and I, that we are going to Slovakia this Summer to teach the kids and teenagers English. Also I never knew that I was good at basketball until about six years ago I joined a league and started playing and quickly realized that this was something that I'm good at and want to do the rest of my life. I started playing baseball when I was four. My mom signed me up for tee ball and I had so much fun that I wanted to play again. So I kept on playing and again, I realized that I was actually pretty good. Growing up baseball has been a key to my success and I have now played on many different travel ball teams and hopefully the middle school team this year. That would be a dream come true because I have worked my whole life for that. This goes to show how much joining an extracurricular activity can do for you. I will do everything in my power to help this rule that the principle has proposed to make this an actual rule so that kids at our school and others can enjoy ourselves.
