Hello,my name is Luke Bomberger and i'm going to talk about the Seagoing Cowboys program. First i'm going to say how fantastic it is being a Seagoing Cowboy. Even though you go on a ship that takes one month to two months it worth the wait getting to the designated area. You can think how many people or animals lives your saving by just becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Imagine going places you never imagined going, like Greece, China. You can also go see places like a excaved castle in Crete even the Panam Canel

Even if the animals have to be fed and watered two to three times a day it's still worth it. You will be tired from pulling bales of hay and bags of oats even stalls had to be clean. There is good things about being a Seagoing Cowboy like when your on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We had tabel tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

I hoped you liked what i said about being a Seagoing Cowboy because i loved being at one. I hope you sign up and become one to, thank you.
