Participating in an activity isn't so bad and would help you. My reasons would make you participate and agree. I agree on participating in at least one extracurricular activity. First, it would help us be distracted in good things. Students wouldn't have time to be sad or depressed because they would be more focused on their activity. We would have less drama and less counselor visits. Kids wouldn't have time to think about drugs because their mind would be on sports, yearbook, or student council. In the end, it would help us be distracted in good things rather than bad things. Second, we would be learning other new things. For example, working on a yearbook helps you learn how to edit pictures and add effects to it. Sports make you learn how to be healthy and be in good shape. Student council would help you be more social. At last, you would be learning more other things from those activities. Lastly, less screen time. Our eyes would be healthy because some of these activities don't require phones or technology. We would be more motivated in watching a game than just playing our phones. Instead of talking to people online you would have them their in real life. All in all, we would have less screen time. In conclusion, participating in at least one extracurricular activity isn't so bad and would benefit you in many ways. Activities distract you in a good way. Your learning other things that school in general wouldn't teach you. Less screen time benefits your eyes. After your activities, you'll be a much better and healthier person.
