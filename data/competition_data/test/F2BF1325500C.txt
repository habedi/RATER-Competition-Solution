The author makes a very good case about going to Venus, but there are many dangers about going there. One example of those dangers is the average tempature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Another one of those dangers is the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than the ones found here on Eath.

The author suggests ways that could make those danger less noticeable. One way the author suggests this is by a project that The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working on. The project is a huge blimp like aircraft. It would travel 30 miles up in the atmosphere and have an average tempature of 170 degrees Fahrenheit. This would also make it possiable to have humans in the atmosphere of Venus.

So in conclution Venus is a worthy pursit. The author did make a good argument that it is worthy to explore Venus, but i would not like to go to Venus anytime soon. Those are just a couple of ways that the author supports the idea that it is worthy to pursue the idea of exploring Venus.
