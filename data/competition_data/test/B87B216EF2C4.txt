Dear Principal,

In my opinion, community service is wonderful. Cleaning up our planet is a righteous thing to do. However, other students here are not as enthusiastic as I am about it. Just the thought of cleaning up litter in our school gives me joy. Besides, community service is important. Students should participate.

For getting students excited about community service, I have a plan to propose to you. What if we create a game that has to do with this subject? We can give a large prize to the person who did the most amount of community service in school, their neighborhood, or at home. Each student will receive a log to write down how many hours they did in the course of two weeks. We can begin this on March 7th. The deadline should be March 21st.

For the grand prize, we could give out a ten pound bag of assorted candies for the winner to share, or have for themselves. What do you think of this plan? This is a rough draft. If you like this plan but think there could be some tweaking, do as you please. I will be waiting for your reply.

P.S. Let's not tell them about the prize, make it mysterious.

Yours truly,
