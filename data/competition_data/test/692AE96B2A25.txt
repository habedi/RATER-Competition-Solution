Have you ever wondered how active you are or how active you could be? Many students have hidden skills, but do not want to use them due to their laziness or lack of interest. If many students are lazy, it could heavily impact their future in a negative way or make them miss out on something that could be extraordinary.Â If the principal were to add a mandatory extracurricular activity, it would come with a lot of pros that can help them in the future. I believe that extracurricular activities would be beneficial because of its way to build stronger relationships with your peers, train your body to be in good shape, and could increase hidden skills that can attract people who will reward you with money, prizes and a lot of opprutunites.

Students around the world are consumed by loneliness or boredom, but that could change with extracurricular activities. If students were to take extracurricular activities, they could be making amazing relationships that could change their lives. For example, a student could be playing basketball and make strategies with his/her peers to win the game. This could help with your listening skills, as well as athletic abilities which are key components to build good bonds with the people around you. But while your playing with your friends, you are also exercising your body to participate in these activities.

Health is a key part to your life and you would be damaging your health if you just sit around, eating junk food, and watching TV. If you decide to take an activity where movement is involved, you will be able to incorporate a lot of exercise in your day. While you move, you are also exercising and losing calories. This could help you lose body fat, encourage you to do more activities to stay fit, or help you focus in school or your activity. Staying in good shape will open so many opprutunites for you to improve or succeed. If you get skilled enough with extracurricular activities, people could reward you with items or opportunities that could change your life for the better.

Skills are a key component to become successful at school, your home or an extracurricular activity that you are taking. If you get skilled enough, people who notice you will be able to help you or reward you for the skill that you are good at. People like coaches, famous artists or singers could recruit you to an activity that could change your life. A student could be making a painting that is as good as the Mona Lisa, or a student could be so skilled that he could compete with famous basketball players like Lebron James or Kyrie Irving. This could all happen if a student were to take a extracurricular activity and put time into their activity.

In conclusion, mandatory extracurricular activities would be beneficial due to all of its opprutunites that it can offer. You could be the popular kid at school with all your new friends, be in good shape so that you can limit your chances of any health problems, or get recruited by people with amazing skills so that they can change your life for the better. Some students are not as motivated as they use to be. All they want to do is stare at their phones for excess hours or look for the best way to cause drama. Unless these students do extracurricular activities, they wont be a significant change and that is why it should be mandatory. They could miss out on something special, or never find their hidden talent. Extracurricular activities could change your life in many ways that you thought were impossible. If you put time into your activity, you never know what could happen, maybe you could be the next legend of your decade, or even century.
