The principle has decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I don't agree because, we already have enough to do at school. We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to. We already hate being in school.

The first reason why is. We already have enough to do at school is because, we have to do 5 SOLS, 2 for English, 1 for math, 1 for civics and economics, and 1 for science. We already have to have 4 blocks a day. We just don't need anymore classes.

The second reason is. We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to because, we already spend around 7 hours in school. Our second block is way to long. We don't have enough time to get to our next class when we have A lunch because the main set of stairs is blocked off.

The last reason is. We already hate being in this school because, one of the light protectors in the gym is hanging down. The school pizza has a lot of grease on it. There is a fight happening almost everyday.

These are the reasons why the principle should not add an extracurricular activity.
