Dear, Mrs. Principal

I believe that it is in the students best interest to choose policy number one.

You should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as longs as the phones are turned off during class.

This would be in best interest of the students here at school, because kids will be less likely to get in trouble due to their cellular devices.

In the long run this will cause less hassle on you because few phones will be taken away and less furious parents having to come in and get their child's phone.

Because you are giving the children an opportunity to operate with their phones during free times, more severe punishments could be put into place if a child's cellular device is to go off during class.

You could make the punishment be as little as a detention or as big as Saturday school/ Friday extension.

This would be beneficial to the kids because they could chat with their friends or communicate with a parent or guardian.

The device could also be used as a studying utensil.

In the long run policy number one that states that you should "allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time." would be better because it will cause less hassle for you.

It will keep the kids out of trouble.

And the kids would be able to communicate with a parent or guardian.

Plus it would make school less boring.
