Summer reading projects are created for students to ''learn" over the summer, and to create chaos in a child's resting period from prison. Every English class that assigns a reading project is just creating a bad grade for the student for when they start their next year off. Summer projects should not be created by teachers because they dont know what the summer will be like for the student, it will cause less conflicts for both students and teachers, and students have a better understanding of what we are capable of.

Firstly, summer projects should be designed by the students rather than the teachers because the teacher does not know what summer for the student is like. For example, my summer last year I was unable to do my summer reading project because I had summer school and i was watching my siblings. I just didnt have any time to spare for reading an entire book and write an essay on it, but if I were to have designed it I wouldve made it to where it was quality work but it wouldn't have been so time consuming, or just out right pointless. The summer isnt all fun and games like teachers make it out to be, it is full of sport training, summer school, jobs, vacations, family visits, and more; and all of those things hold a much higher value in life than an essay about a book i will forget that i even read by the end of the month.

Secondly, summer projects should be created by students because, it will cause less conflicts for both students and teachers. The curriculum says that we have to do something as a project for the summer, so why not let the students come up with it themselves. Doing so would help resolve multiple conflicts including but not limited to: causing less stress in the students lives, the student couldnt complain because they came up with the idea, the teacher wouldnt have to do the extra work of creating the assignment, and more people will get it done because the students will not put as much work into it. For example, if the students were to make a project for the students then they would make something easy and doable, therefor more children will learn over the summer because more kids will do it rather than procrastinating to do the project and then not doing it at all.

Lastly, the reason why students should design the summer projects is because they know what they are capable of doing. For example, teachers give us different assignments throughout the years that are way out of our capabilities and the summer projects are usually one of them because they think we should have to have enough work to last us the full two weeks. Yet, on the other hand the students just want to get a good grade and not have a summer project ruin the rest of their, already short lives. some teachers might argue and say, "well, the students just want an easy A," and even if that is the case, legally the summer is time where school has no authority over a student. Therefor they shouldn't be giving us any work at all. So, if the schools want our projects to be finished during the summer they should let the students design it.

In conclusion, the summer projects should be designed by the students and not the teachers because it would better everyone in the long run. The amount of zeros in the grade books for the summer project would lessen. Teachers may fight back for their own reasons but if the students are persistent about it then they can make the change.
