Dear principal,

I heard that you are requiring all students to perform community service.

I think that is a great idea because we would be helping are community became better.

Some of the students think that doing community service take too long and that it is boring. Helping are community can make people see that helping are community is a good thing.

People who think that community service is boring say that because they think that it is not cool and that they have other thing that are important.

But what they don't see that community service is important and is a good thing.

That is why I think that your decision is great

Students think that it takes too long and boring.

It may take too long but is wealth the time.

By doing community service you influence people and you became a better person.

It mite be boring but people can make it fun.

If student decide to pick up liter they could make it to a game.

If people don't see that helping our community good imagine if nobody help it.

that's why helping it is good.

It mite even change some of the students sincerely student
