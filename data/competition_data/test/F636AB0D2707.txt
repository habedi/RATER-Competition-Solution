The school year has now ended,but you also have to complete a summer project. After all do you think the summer project would better if it was student designed?"summer schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-desined". Summer projects should be student designed because the project would much easier to do and you would have more options to choose from instead of one being given without choice.

The summer project would be easier if it was student designed because most of the time the summer projects that we all get are difficult. Also the student designed project would make other students feel relaxed and at ease,because the work that would be in the project would be straight forward and you wouldn't have to do a lot of extra stuff. After all it would still be related to the subject that you are in that requires a summer project completed. Although,The projects wouldn't be as long as the other summer projects we get because those summer projects that students get from teachers would be a thick packet of work sometimes. Since the projects wouldn't be as long as the summer projects that students get now, it would make life so much easier to get these projects done in no time.

The best part of the student designed summer projects is that students will have plenty of options to choose from. The projects would be related to any subject in school and you would only need to pick one for your summer break to do it. If we had options for summer projects it would be less stressful because,For example,the project i've gotten was only from English class,and those projects would be a thick packet of questions and summaries that we would have to answer and write for a book that each student has of their own to read. Also there is people that English isn't their best subject and when they get a thick packet of stuff they have to do for a book,then they would struggle because some don't like reading at all. Even though it would be better if students could choose a summer project that doesnt't always have to be from English class. However, some people would say that"well,students should always have an English summer project so that they can get better at their reading skills,but people don't always need an English project because some people rather do other summer projects for another class which would make things less stressful.

Summer projects can really be a pain,but if it was student designed it would make students life less stressful. Even though it is still good to keep learning while we are on our summer break because we hate forgetting all the stuff we learned that wasn't as difficult. Also English can be a struggle for people there are people who dont like reading because it is boring and can barely focus on words.
