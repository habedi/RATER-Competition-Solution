Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock . You watch the clock's hand slowly move towards freedom, the end of the school day. Without extracurriculars to interrupt core classes like math, english, science, and history, the school day is long and tedious. Curriculum planned by the state can be confusing and boring, making kids stressed and unfocused mere hours into the day. It's hard to find time for hobbies with the mountains of homework given in classes that aren't chosen by kids. Designed to be fun and engaging, activities outside of the four main classes include things like band, orchestra, yearbook, sports, and more, depending on what different schools offer. Students should have to participate in extracurriculars during the school day because they can alleviate stress, make students socialize, and help kids find new interests.

After test upon test upon test, extracurriculars give students a little bit of solace and time to relax. Classes, especially math and science, make students labor hard over textbooks and homework. Activities that students choose to take, like yearbook or student council, typically have little to no homework. These classes are more free form, a place that isn't so strict compared to core subjects. Because they're chosen subjects, not forced, they are also more fun for the children taking them. Students are always worrying about grades, which usually aren't a problem in extracurriculars because they are easy to earn as long as work is completed on time in class.

Not every student is a social butterfly, but electives help them to reach out of their comfort zones. Required classes are usually silent, making it hard to make new friends. Electives help kids meet people who share the same interests as them. Even if a person is introverted, it's good to find someone who shares something in common with them. For students that already have friends in their classes, they can talk more and may even be allowed to sit next to each other, a privilege rare in core subjects.

If a student has a job to help support their family outside of the school day, then between homework and their work they don't have time to find new interests. Special classes during the school day create the time and space for students to explore new hobbies. These interests can lead kids to think about their futures and potential career options. For example, a student who works on the school newspaper can find great enjoyment in writing and can think about majoring in journalism. Activities like student council and speech and debate give kids a look into political jobs, which later in life they may want to pursue.

Students shouldn't be forced to do anything, but they still have free choice with extracurriculars because there are many different classes that they can elect to take. The next time you're asked if you support extracurriculars during the school day, say yes. These activities can be a great break from the school day, help people make new friends, and help kids find new interests.
