Do you think The Face on Mars is natural? As a scientist at NASA I sure do! I think it is natural because we (NASA) released the pictures within a few days of taking them. Also, the pictures would show any alien markings. Finally, the story says that there are some of those formations on earth. I truly believe that it is a natural formation.

We, NASA, released pictures of The Face on Mars just a few days after we took them. Would we do that if we believed it was evidence of alien activity? Would we want to show that to the public, I don't think so! If we believed that it was alien related we wouldn't show the public and get them riled up. It would be nonsensical. I highly doubt that we would show the public if it was aliens.

Don't you think our top of the line cameras would show any alien markings? In the passage it even says each pixel from our camera is only 1.56 meters! That is a very large zooming ability! Our cameras are very expensive, and are top of the line. We use those cameras for the reason of seeing very small details like markings and any other little things. I really think our cameras would have picked up any alien markings, if there was any!

Finally, there are land formations like that on our own planet, earth! There are what we call mesas found all over the American West, which is the same things as the formation on mars. The mesas are formed from a lava dome. Also we know that something like that can happen on mars just like it can on earth. I think the landform is a mesa just like we have on earth.

Is The Face on Mars natural? I think so! I think that because NASA would not release pictures like that if they thought it was alien related! Also our top of the line cameras would have shown any little alien markings if there was any. Lastly, there are mesas on earth as well! I believe that The Face on Mars is a natural land formation, don't you?
