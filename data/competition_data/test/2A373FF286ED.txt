DEAR PRINCIPAL,

I believe that you should not allow students to have phones during school here is why.

first the reason should not be any phones in school is the student might try to sneak the phone under a book a desk any were the phone cannot be seen. By doing this they will get really distracted during class and when its time for a test or what ever there going to fail it.

the second reason there should be no cell phones is because who is the student going to call or text. The student must have everyone that goes to that school on his or her contact list why just not talk to your friend when you are allowed to talk.

Final reason there should no phones is because I know students will say its just for emergencies why when every room has about two phones in each class. if there is really a emergency just take turns calling each others parents.

These are all my reasons why there should not be cell phones at all.
