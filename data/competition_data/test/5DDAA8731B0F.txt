Luke enjoyed the life of being a seagoing cowboy but he thought it would be even better if more people had the opportunity to be a seagoing cowboy. Luke thought that the adventures and the different places were awesome so he convince people to become a seagoing cowboy. As soon as he got onto land he started telling everyone about all the fun and all of the adventure. Soon he ran into a man named Stuart and started telling him all about the mystery, excitement, and the fun that came with being a seagoing cowboy.

"Imagine it" said Luke "going places you've never gone before, doing thing you've never even heard of, and lastly seeing sights you've never seen before." Stuart thought about it for a moment and then he decided to become a seagoing cowboy. Soon enough Stuart, Luke, and many new members were looking for places to go and people who wanted to join them.

Soon enough there were so many members that not only were there a couple groups but a lot and it was all because of Luke. All the seagoing Cowboys liked the excitement and everything about being a seagoing cowboy. For many years all the seagoing Cowboys sailed the seas happily.
