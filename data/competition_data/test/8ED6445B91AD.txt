Everybody likes to do fun things with their friend after school, so why not join an extracurricular activity!

For example, you could join a club that includes your interests, or start playing a new sport you've always wanted to try.

Participating in a least one extracurricular activity can be extremely beneficial in so many ways.

I believe that everybody in school should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can hang out with friends, stay active, and you can choose which activity you want to join from an endless number of options!

One reason I think it is a great idea for every student to join an extracurricular activity is because it is a great way to hang out with friends after school.

Spending time with friends outside of class is a great way to bond with each other.

For example, if you and your friend join a sports team, you will learn to trust one another and play well together.

Also, extracurricular activities are fantastic ways to meet new friends!

You will learn how to work with people who have similar interests as you.

Also, you can get a perspective on how they do things, which can help you to acquire a wide variety of skill.

Joining an extracurricular is a great way to spend time with people from other middle schools as well.

There is a possibility that you could go to the same high school as them, so becoming friends with them now could come in handy in the future!

Another benefit of extracurricular activities is that they can help you to stay health and active throughout the year.

Keeping your body healthy and fit will cause less health related issues, and will keep you feeling energized throughout the day.

Also, joining a sport in middle school will set you up for success in high school sports.

If you know that you want to play a sport in high school, starting to play it in middle school is an excellent way to get a head start.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also benefit your grades as well.

Exercise has been found to reduces stress, and with less stress you will do better on tests and be less tired throughout the school day.

Finally, the extracurricular activities to choose from are endless!

There are extracurricular activities for every type of person.

One of the many options is bound to fit your interests.

Also,

If you have your heart set on a specific club, you can start it yourself.

As long as your idea is appropriate, and others are interested as well, you can start any club you want!

For example, If you wanted to start a book club for a certain genre, all you would have to do is get signatures from others also interested and then talk to a teacher who works at the school to help sponsor it.

Also,

If there is a sport you want Generic_School to start offering, then just talk to an adult at the school about it.

I know many of the fabulous teachers at Generic_School play sports and would be happy to help you start a new one at the school.

In conclusion,

I believe that it is a great idea for every student to participate in an extracurricular activities because you can spend time with friends, stay active, and you can choose which activity you want to join from an endless number of options!

Everybody in the school can benefit from extracurricular activities in some way, even the teachers!

Everybody deserves free time to do what they want, and participating in extracurricular activities is the perfect way to do it! The ways extracurricular activities can help students, teacher and the community are endless!
