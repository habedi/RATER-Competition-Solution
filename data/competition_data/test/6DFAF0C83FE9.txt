Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is a planet from our solar system is simple to see from the distant, exploring venus is a challenge because present dangers. Numerous factors contribute to Venus' s reputation. More challeging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphera; NASA is working to studying Venus.

First, "Venus, sometimes called the " Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot" because is simple to see from the distant. "it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely." ; exploring venus present dangers because is a planet close to sun.

Second, numerous factors contribute to Venu's reputation for study to humans."often reffered to as Earth's "twin" because venus is closest to Earth in differents factors like density, size and sometimes in distances too.

Third, " Even more challenging are the couds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's athmosphere" because their conditions are extreme to humans on Earth. High pressure, geology and weather present additional impediments to see:

naturals reactions like erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and this make difficult to study venu's. NASA is working to studying Venus and they try differents things using materials with differents elements to see how reaction each one for example; "some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tasted in a chamber simulating the chaos of venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such contions."

In conclusion, really exploring Venus is a difficult challenge because differents factors are impidiments to humans to study close. weather, high temperatures and geology is not a good help to know more about venus because not reaction like on others planets like Earth. Actually NASA is trying and trying differents projects with simple electronics in our life.
