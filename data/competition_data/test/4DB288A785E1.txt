Everybody shows emotion every day, they are apart of the human nature. Dr. Huang and his partner have high knowledge adn are highly educated at making improved ways for humans and computers to communicate. Dr. Huang and his partner made a computer, Facial Action Coding System, that can so called "calculate" eamotions. This computer could be valuable to read expressions of students in classrooms.

People would say that when they are or were in school that they were had some type of emotion about the lesson that htey were going to learn. "'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confude or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts" (paragraph 6). This computer could help the students learn and teachers could help the students better if they are unexcited, bored, or even confused. When a teach knows that a student(s) are bored or confused with a lesson they try to change it to where the students won't be. "'Then it [the computer] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" (paragraph 6).

With the Facial Action Coding System the teacher would really have to do much and figure out how to change the whole lesson but still have the same content and have it in the same time length as planned.

To help students understand in the classroom the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable by reading the students expressions. Citizens who go or went to school would agree that this computer could help and even Dr. Huang said that it could help students. It could also help teachers by not taking up there time so they could get other stuff done, like grading paper and looking at other lessons.
