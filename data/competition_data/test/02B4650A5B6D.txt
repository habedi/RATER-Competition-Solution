Venus, the Earth's twin or so we thought. With and atmosphere of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide and average surface tempurture over eight hundred degrees. What dangers do we face trying to study Venus? Or why would we not try to find another place to substain human life?

Why is the author even suggest studying Venus?

Why does the author even support studying Venus? Venus's main atmosphere my be over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit but just above the cloud such as Earth there is a much calmer atmosphere. Thirty-plus miles above the surface, tempertures drop to around 170 degree ,but the air pressure returns to about the air pressure around sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiaton wouldn't exceed Earth level. Not easy conditions to live in but survivable for humans.

Finding another place to substain human life is a nessisary thing because of the growing population on Earth ,and the ever present threat of gobal warming. Earth is not gonna be here forever and we need a place to live if all goes South. What would be the best place to substain life, well that has not been decided yet but what better way to start than learning about Earth's twin.

The author says " If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even dicussing further vists to its surface? Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." Even with past failures of trying to land on Venus the author supports the idea of exploring it. This is becasue of the thought that Earth will be like Venus in it life time.

The author completely supports further exploration on Venus even with the dangers. He belives it is worth the risk to learn more about where life can be substained, what Earth's future looks like, and to learn more about Venus's past.
