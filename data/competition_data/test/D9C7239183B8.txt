Many schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their summer brake. Do you think they should be Student-designed or teacher-designed?. They should be student-designed because it gives students a chance to be creative,they can learn something they are interested in,and finally lets them have fun with their projects during the summer.

Although some people may argue that letting the students choose their own projects would lead to them either not doing it or to them choosing the easiest subject and finishing it in a day or two,But there are other view points to consider.

First,Letting students choose their own projects will let them be creative. A lot of students like to stand out and be different from the rest of their peers. As many people know not every student is the same and not every student thinks the same way. So they should let the students express themselves in their projects and even teachers will get to see a whole other side to their students that they never knew they had. For example,every artist in the world are expressing them selves everyday with their art and millions of people love it,and do you think that a teacher assigned that art work to them?.

Secondly,Students will be able to work on something they are interested in. Many schools and teachers force kids into learning something they dont want to learn or have not interest in and that is why they dont retain any of the information. I understand that not every subject they need will catch there attention but when it comes to something they have a choice in learning most kids will choose what they are really interested in. Why? because we as people don't like it when someone tells us we have to learn this or do this assignment and when they do they are not going to do it with effort,why,because they don't like it or have interest in it. When they let the student choose what they want to learn then they will do it with passion and lost of interest because they like the subject and really want to learn more about and so they will try their best and they will learn new things about a subject that they never knew before. For example,Kaka was one of the greatest soccer players in the world,winning many champions of Europe and many others,and his parents were lawyers and wanted him to become oneas well but he had no interest in it. No matter how much his parents tried he didnt find interest in it until he started playing soccer and he loved with a passion and so his parents let him do that. So letting their son do something that he found interest in it led him to become one of the greatest soccer player the world has ever seen.

Finally,it lets the students have a little fun with their projects and during the summer. Now these students are still kids and still need to have fun during their summer brake because they did jest go thought months of learning and when they finally get out they have to learn even more. Plus if the project is teacher-designed then they are going to feel like they are back in school but if they choose what they wanna do for their project then they can have fun while doing it. Like i said in the above argument they will be learning something they have interest in and you never know with kids they can come up with some weirdest and funnest things for their projects. They are able to do many experiments for their projects when they dont feel obligated to do it and can jest do fun things that get it done.

In Conclusion,summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students a chance to be creative,they can learn something they are interested in,and finally lets them have fun with their projects during the summer. because of the reasons listed here,Students should choose there summer project. also these kids are our country's future and they need to know that expressing themselves is ok and letting people know what they want is also important. Thank you for considering my view points.
