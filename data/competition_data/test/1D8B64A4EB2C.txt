People should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Reasons for what i`m saying. The reason people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is so you can help the people in the middle of world war II because they have no shelter, food, or animals and their families

Another reason is that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is so you can have a different view to other people and have a different pase to life. Also you can meet different people that you can make friends with and talk to other people about their life and why they joined the Seagoing Cowboys. You could also play games like baseball, and volleyball. You could also play table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and game like those while on the seas.

Last reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is so you can have views that you would probally never see. You can also see other cultures and views you wouldnt see on a plane.

Everyone needs to help out one another. They could make new friends that they would have never made before.
