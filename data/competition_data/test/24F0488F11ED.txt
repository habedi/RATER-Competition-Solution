Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think policy 1 is ok for us students because don't you think we are already bored of being in class all day and just learning that's sometimes boring i think we should use are phone During lunch and other free times because we want to talk to are other friends that don't go to this school and its not fair how other teachers get to use there phones in class and make us mad because they can and we cant and all of us want something to do at lunch some of us students at lunch don't even do anything we are still bored if we are at lunch how does a cell phone effect you teachers if you guys are not even teaching at lunch it doesn't cause no harm we just want to talk and have something that entertains us just for a little bit we can just use them at lunch and when we go back to class we can just turn it off and anyways texting on the phone doesn't hurt anybody just give us 1 try and if we don't turn it off during class or find someone texting during class you can take off the rule and never trust us again if you put this rule think about how much students are going to like you and be more nice to you and actually more students are going to want you to stay as are principal because of what you are doing for us and what if im stuck in a fire how m i going to call for help if everybody is going to be on the field and if you do i wont have to be worried because ima have my phone and i can just call the school for help that im stuck in a fire some were in the school and what if there is a crazy man in the school and i couldn't bring my phone for that policy and if he has a gun i could just call the cops from my phone if you let phones in the school so please let all of ur wonder full student's bring there phone sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
