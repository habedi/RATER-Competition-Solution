People referr Venus as the Earth's twin since it is the closest planet to Earth, but this does not mean that it is easy to explore. Venus is easy to spot, but people have sent spacecraft to Venus but not a single one touched Venus in three decades. This makes it hard for people to explore the planet if they can only see it, but can't be on it to see how it really looks and works on the inside.

The atmospheric pressure it 90 times than that of Earth's. The conditions that occur in Venus make it extreme for any man to even step foot on, due to the envierment of the plantet to crush even a submarine and causing the submarine to liguidfy and no human being could survive.

The harsh conditons are not stopping scientists from exploring Venus. The reason for this is because a long time ago, Venus might have been surrounded by oceans. And water means life.
