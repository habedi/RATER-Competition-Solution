Dear Principal,

I think for the policy change to only have students with a grade B average is a good idea. I think it will show the students that they need to work hard to do an extra - curricular activity.

Since most students only have a grade C average it will show them that they need to work harder if they want to be in a sport or another activity. i think if all students work harder they will then be a more efficient team and also a good student in school. All the test scores will be higher, because more people will want to work harder if they know that if they do bad they can't play a sport that they really care about.

Also, I think it's a great idea because then with more students wanting to work harder then test scores will be better, which will make behavior better. With people working hard and doing what they are supposed to do will make it easier for people to worry about other important things than just goofing around and messing with people.

The school would also see a better attitude in people. Since everyone would be exceeding and doing great in school, but also playing a sport they love with their friends. I think it would make a huge difference. Since students today complain about coming to school they might actually enjoy it. I think it would make school a better place to be and more fun for the students. Also it would be nice to look back and remember how well you did in school and how much fun you had playing the sport you love. Besides, who doesn't want to be successful?

So I think it is a great idea to only allow students with a grade B

average to be the only ones to participate in sports and other activities. I think it would allow more students to work harder. It would also let test scores be higher and the students attitudes will be better and they won't be worrying about messing around.
