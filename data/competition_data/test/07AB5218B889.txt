Would you believe that my principal, the proud representative of Generic_School Middle School is choosing to force students to stay after school for no less than one activities regardless of my or any other kids feelings? Sadly you would have to believe me because that is the truth. Instead of implementing a beneficial policy to school grounds our principal choose to take away students freedoms. I know for a fact that other students feel the way I do. I believe that this is a complete mistake making this decision because, it adds to the mountains of stress students already receive, it will conflict with students interests, and the idea that this is forced upon students is something that will not make us proud or happy to go to Generic_School.

One of the major reasons why this is a terrible policy is the amount of stress that participating in an extracurricular will add. Students already have large amounts of stress due to balancing homework, projects, studying for tests, S.O.L's, and getting enough sleep every night. Also, if students stay after for a club there interested in there is no guarantee everyone in that group is as nice as you. Teens can be major jerks and sometimes can put you in an bad situation. I wouldnt want to be forced to stay after school in an unsafe and uncomfortable environment. I have stayed after school many times and it has not been enjoyable, theres always at least one kid that has an issue with everyone that looks at him/her. A mandatory policy like this increases the number of opportunities for bullying to ac cure. I wouldnt want to be forced to stay after school in an unsafe and uncomfortable environment.

Another crucial reason why this policy should not be instated is the conflict with students interests, outside of school, it will have. Students have many interests outside of school, if another activity were to be forced onto them it would affect there current schedules massively. I am currently participating in four activities outside of school, an additional one would through me off completely. A lot of kids including myself have a bit of a routine on a daily basis, this policy will mess up my routine. Also, what if there are know clubs/activities that a student is interested in?. Are they supposed to just tough it out and waste two hours their time doing something they dont enjoy. After school programs last from 2:30 to 4:30. Sometimes I get dropped off at my stop at 6:30 and in the winter its dark out by then. That leaves me maybe an hour of homework if i'm lucky, because I most likely already have something going on. As it is the school grading system is unfair, because if someones writing is truly brilliant but they did not follow the rubric the will get an F, While somebody whos writing is very dull and boring will get an A. The last thing students need is less time to do schoolwork.

My third and final point on why this policy is a big mistake is the fact that this is forced upon us. If theres one thing Teenagers dont like its got to be rules that limit what they can do. It is nice having the option to stay after, I would not to be forced to do so. A policy that has been instated at Generic_School is the phone policy. It states that kids mayn not be on there mobile device at all during the school day, this has increased the number of students using there phones, even more people than before the policy. The reason why teens shoplift is because its taboo, there forced to not steal, so they then steal. A country in south America is experimenting with a new law were cocaine is legal. It has actually decreased the amount of people using it, by making it legal it gave people less pf a reason to do it. My point is that if students were forced to stay after it would cause rebellion and protest and negative attitudes among the students.

In conclusion, A policy that forces students to participate in at least one extracurricular is a tremendous mistake because it will negatively impact students by adding to there stress, conflicting with there interests outside of school, and forcing this upon them.
