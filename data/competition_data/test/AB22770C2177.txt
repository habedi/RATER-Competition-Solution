I believe it is very important to limiit car use on the road. People even are starting to sell their cars for example 70 percent of vaubans families do not own a car people say it is less stress full without a car and easier

There are plenty of other safe and eficent  ways to get around town other then a car. for example bicyles,scother,walking and the list goes on and on. Also we running out of fuel we need to conserve what we have left it is very important to me that pople dont take avtange of this

People dont not realize this. There are also many advantes in limiting car use for eveyone in their own way for example by using less gass we can also help are planet which is very important caus people do not realize of think about what they are to doing to the earth for are next  genaration to come overall we should limit car use and if every one does their you would be amazed on mush much of a difference and change we can make for the planet
