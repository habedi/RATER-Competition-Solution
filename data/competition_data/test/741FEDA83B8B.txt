Limiting car use can be a good thing and a bad thing. In my opinion i think that people should be able to drive cars but only at certain times to limit polution. in europe as staded "while their have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs....".

in this storey you can teel that alot of these people in europe are not liking the fact that their is polution going on. "all of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change" (paragraph 7). i can agree sort of with this because we focus on cars alot as one of our major ways of transportation. this is not a bad thing that we have cars but we need to make sure that we can keep the polution down by maybe using hybrid cars instead.

it also seems that people are starting to drive less nowadays, and in my opinion it is because either gas prices are too high or people cannot afford one."americas love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, acording to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives, an invesment research company as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995" (paragraph 32). as you can see i was stating how the number of people driving has declined. also i believe the cause for this as i stated before is due to the number of people who can either not afford one or do not want one.

in this storey i have explained how the number of people driving cars have declined.

i have also said that europe does not really like the idea of the polution they are creating since they end up making so much smog. In my opinion maybe other countrys such as the U.S.A or canada and such should consider knocking down some of their driving privilages due to the fact that it is just too loud and not very safe as well as creating alot of polution.
