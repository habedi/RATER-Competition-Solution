Dear senator,

The Electoral College makes voting useless. If we want our voices to be heard as free citizens of this country then we should have full power over the votes. We are the people of America and we deserve to decide who takes the presidency. This country is our home and important to us and we deserve to be heard. I understnad that the Electoral College makes the whole voting process a whole lot easier, but it's not about easy. It's about our freedom and our freedom of speech.

The Electoral College is a system that selects electors to stand in place of us, but we the people aren't getting what we deserve. For example, if Florida has 29 electors and most of the state is voting for Romney, then those 29 electoral votes go to Romney. But suppose a smaller, less popular state like Wyoming only has 3 electors and most of the state votes for Obama; he only recieves 3 electoral votes. Now tell me, is that fair? Is it really?

Our purpose in the voting polls is disapperaing and now these candidates only count on the states that have the most electoral votes because they will count for more during the election. Candidates go around trying to win over the states with many electors and tend to ignore the ones with less. Even going as far as not advertising their campaigns. The Electoral College needs to be abolished so our country can be free once again.
