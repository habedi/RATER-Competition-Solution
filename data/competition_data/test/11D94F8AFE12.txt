How would you feel working with NASA on finding a way to look at Venus and actually be able to go on Venus without being burnt or hurt with how hot it is. Being able to work with NASA would be cool because you would get to learn how to use alot of technology and learn so much about all the planets. Venus is worth the pursuit because of all the characteristics and features and how hot it gets.

Venusus is actually the second planet clostest to the sun. With Venus being so close to the sun it makes Venus one of the hotest planets in the universe. Even though there is a planet between the sun and venus the sun is making venus more hotter because it is about the same size as the the sun. Venus being the hotest planet is can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Nothing has been on Venus in three decades because it it so hot that everytime they send something to land on Venus it turns to a liquid.

Venus has almsot the same features as planet earth. Planet earth is covered in oceans, and could have supported various forms of life. Venus Could have oceans, and could support various forms of life just like earth. Venus has some features that are analogues to those on earth. Today Venus has a surfacw of rocky, sediment and includes familiar featrues such as valleys, mountains and craters. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the potions for making such a mission both safe and scienfically productive is because the NASA has one compelling idea to make blip like cahicle hoverign over 30 miles or so above the roiling Venusian landscape so they can get an idea of what the landscaping looks like.

NASA is on a misson to stat a project to get all the stuff they can to make somethign so that theu are able to get it to land on Venus sincce nothing has landed on Venus in three decades. If NASA

uses the blimp like vehicle to make it to Venus they will be able to see what Venus looks like and what they need to use and how to use some of the material to make the project / mission able to fly to Venus without VEnus making it luiqify to a liquid. NASA has been working on this mission for a long time and are hoping to find a thing to make to fly to Venus and land it up ther for the first time ina long time about three decades ago is when something was last landed on Venus

In this essay I explained to you why Venus os a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. There might be a lot of dangers with Venus but by reading the prompt NASA would do anything to get somethign to land on Venus. It would be cool to have something land on Venus for the first time in forever. This essay is why Venus is worth the pursuit because of all the characteristics and features and how hot it gets.
