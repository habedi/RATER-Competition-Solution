I think everyone should be in the Seagoing Cowboy Program. Everyone should be in the program because it helped me more aware of other countries and their needs. It also helped open the world . This just may help you feel the same way it made me feel, greatful, and I want you to have the same experience I had.

Everyone should join the program because it helps awareness. Also because it is a opportunity of a lifetime, you would never want to miss. In the process you experenice a lot of unique thging's. Some cool things that you will experience are: the Pacific war ending, traveling over the Atlantic Ocean, China, and more. This would be a life time opportunity you wpuld not want to miss.

Some more reasons why you should join the program is because you would have a lot of fun. Some things you would do are: play baseball,volleyball, table tennis, boxing, and more. These things would be a lot of fun if you get your friends and some family to also come and join the program. You would do all of these fun things but also do some work. Everyone would have a job and be put to work. Don't worry, your job won't be that bad.

In the prgram you will also go on cattle-boat trips. Every cattle-boat ride is an unbelievable opportunity. On the cattle-boat you will have the benifits of seeing Europe and China. Every cattle-boat ride is not only an opportunity, but its an adventure. Its and adventure you can't miss.

This about everything you will be doing in the program, and maybe even more. A lot of people have done this, including me. All of these things helped me open up to the world. I hope everyone can join the program have almost the same, or the same experience. This is an opportunity you can't miss, dont pass this up. You will bed missing one of the best experences in your life.
