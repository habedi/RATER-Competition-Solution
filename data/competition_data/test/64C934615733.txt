Studies have shown 60% of students are more stressed out then theyll ever be. In my opinion, I think all students shouldn't be required to participate in at least extracurricular activity. I believe this because students have lots of stress already to complete other work, and doing any extracurricular activity even if its just one can add so much more stress.

Millions of students drop out every year, because they cant handle this stress that comes with school. Research has shown more than half of these millions of student were involved in some sort of extracurricular activity. Almost all these student regret it now, but back then it was a savior.

Another reason they shouldn't be required to take be in a extra curricular activity is, because people have families and nobody wants be stuck in a club, or at practice while the rest of their family is eating out. It shouldn't require someone to ask them self if they should go to soccer practice or go to their aunts cookout. Extracurricular activities arent only stressful on the students who participate in them but its also stressful on parents who might have to take their kid to practice or pick their kid's up from school after a club meeting. Most single parents who have work cant even take their kids to practice and have to call a friend to take their kid.

There are millions of reasons why students shouldn't be required to participate in a extracurricular activity. Those are just a few I could think of right now. Thats why I think the rule that all students should be required to participate in a extracurricular should be removed.
