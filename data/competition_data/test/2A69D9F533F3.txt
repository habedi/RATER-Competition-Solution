Giant human face discovered on Mars! NASA phototgraphed an image of a landform on Mars specifically a region called Cydonia that showed the feature of a human face. Some think that Face was created by aliens. Although scentific evidence proves that the Face is a natural land form.

When the Face first got phototgraphed NASA "unveiled the image for all to see." in an attempt to get people to be more interested in mars. "Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rahter hide, say conspiracy theorist." Yet the article goes on th say "Few scientis belebed that Face was an alien artifact..." This means that many scientiss knew that the Face was a landform form the very beginning but only used it to get money for NASA to research more about Mars. Not only this but the weather was not an ideal time for the image to be taken.

When the image was taken it was at a certain time, year, and season. " this on had unusual shadows..." means that the sun was not hitting it deredctly to elliminate any shawdows that were there. "But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north...where it was winter in April'98-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Plant." This proves that the weather does have an effect on the image. Not only that but the image taken at this time was cloudy and reveladed a natural landform. The article goes on to say "a cloudless summmer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...Malin's tean captured an extrodinary photo using the carmera's absolute maximum resoluiton." Meaning that the image was as clear as it could be and there were no clouds to make the image blurry. "What the pictue actually shows is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." This proves that landforms like these were also seen on Earth and alien did not make it. Plus landforms like it had been seen on Earth

Further more, this is not the first time a natural landform has been seen on Mars. In the passage it is stated "Scienetist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one has unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh." This means that in the location where the Face was discovered landforms were common and nothing more than natural.

An image of a face was photographed on Cydonia. NASA proved that the Face is only a natural landform on Mars and with enough eveidence to support it. The giant "human" face is just another natural landform and most definatly wasn't created by aliens on Mars.
