In my oponion, I think the state senator should not change the Electoral College by popular vote for the President of the United States. I think it should not change because this process consists of the selection of the electors. This is where they vote for President and Vice President as well as the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The majority of the electoral votes is to elect the president. This also makes things much easier because each candidate running for president for your state has their own group electors where the electors are chosen by the candidates political party. It is also helpful because you actually help choose your states electors when you vote for your candidate you are voting for your candidates electors. At the end it makes it easier on the governor to list all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.
