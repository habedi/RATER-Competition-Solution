In this article it was talking about how there is now a program that can read the known human emotions by useing a 3D model of whoever its trying to read. Like students in class it will be able toread their emotion in call and see if they are bored or unhappy with the lession that is going on. Also the evidence to back it up is that this program has read the emotion of Mona lisa with. Actual rates of her emotions but we could not use this program at home because it is way to complex for it also it uses the same technique that divinci used by using human anatomy which they said would be great for video games and video surgery. Which in the end will greatly increase childrens involement in the class room because. It will know what really gets the kids engaged into whatever the teacher may be teaching at the time.
