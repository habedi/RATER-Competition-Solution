America would be a better place if there were no vehicles. Americans could walk wherever they go, instead of sitting down and riding/driving there. With much extra walking time, we would probably lose a lot of weight and get healthy or healthier than some already are. America has the largest percentage of obese citizens, more than any other country in our world. With the loss of vehicles we could change that.

Not many people realize this, but vehicles and any kind of chair is a lot of the reason why Americans are so obese. We sit down for every thing that we do. We sit in the car, at school, at work, at home, etc. If everyone walked to their destination they would burn calories and fat. Just getting rid of vehicles would make a dramatic change in the amount of obese people. Researchers suggest that obesity is caused mainly by laziness, and vehicles bring that suggestion to life.

All I'm tryin to say is that if we get rid of vehicles then Americans would not be so fat because they would actually have to get up off of their lazy butts and walk to a restaurant or grocery store to go get their food.
