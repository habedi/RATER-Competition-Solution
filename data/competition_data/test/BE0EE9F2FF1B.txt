To many people the idea of a driverless car can seem a long time from here but it is actualy closer than you think. In 2016 Tesla is making a car that drives itself 90% of the time. But with these new technologies people are divided on the idea of 100% driverless cars.

With driverless cars being a possibility in the near future the technology can really help people who otherwise would not be able to be in a car by themselves. For example a blind man would be able to go some were without the need of another person. Or a physicly disabled person could enjoy a road trip by themselves.

Although some people would say that the cars are really expensive, well you would be right they are expensive but in 2016 Tesla the same company developing the 90% selfdriving car is releasing a new battery powerd car. And yes this has been available for years but this car is a step in the right derection. The car is said to be afordable with a price tag in the $20,000 dollar range. And these cars ususaly came with a $100,000 price tag and as you see with this car it is easy to think that the driverless cars could be afordable in a couple years. And with Tesla taking the first leap into this technology you can expect great results.

With Driverless cars roaming the street it is fully possible to end all crashes. The cars wouldn't have human input which in turn would cancel the possability of human errors. And with the creation of self driving cars us as humans would advance with better technology and this would be a boost to help push are limits in the auto industry.
