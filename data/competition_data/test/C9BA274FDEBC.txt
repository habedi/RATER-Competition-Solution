Dear principle,

I think that more kids should help out the community every once in awhile. But what i also think that kids should have the freedom to choose what they want to do in their free time. If they feel that they should help out the community then they can. But others do not have the time or they might just have other things they might rather to do.

Since community service helps the environment and helps keep the town clean, i think you should maybe start a club where they can do these kind of things. If they so desire to join the club they will have the free will to choose. Some of the kids might think that it is a waste of there time. Well, add something interesting to the club that will grab other kids attention. Like for example have fun activities that is community work, but is fun for the kids to do. If their was a club that did community service, i wouldn't join, but if the club wasn't all revolved around community work and had other activities to do, i think i might be more willing to join.

Don't make the club all about community service. Have little activities that the kids will enjoy doing. Like making art out of things from the out doors or maybe have camping at a park. Something that will sound interesting enough for the kids to enjoy.

They key point is that some people thing community work isn't for them because it doesn't sound appealing. If you take away their freedom to do what they want they could get upset for that. But when you give them the freedom to chose some might be willing to join the club. I think that a community club is a good thing to do and so might others.

Sincerely, student
