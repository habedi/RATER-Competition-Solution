Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should let students bring their phones to school because you never know when they be an emergency. What if someone comes in tries to rob the school and you cant call for help. The students can call or text for help. I do think students should be only allowed to use their phones in their own time or in lunch but not in class. If you let students bring phones to school you have an advantage because they can call a student that didn't come to school that day and ask why didn't they come.

I really do think that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, because you never know when you might need them . I do think they should have the phones of in class because they can get distracted and not put attention to the teacher. You can also use the help of the student incase you lost somebody or cant find them. I also think it will give them something to distract them. So they wont just think of school and the tests. Cell phones should be allowed for many reasons such as if they go on a field trip and their parents don't know what time to pick them up from school. They can just call their parents when there heading to school already. What if the have to stay after school? What if there parents don't pick up? They cant just stand their in front of the office until they pick up. So if you have your phone you can just text them or call them at what ever time you want with a teachers consent if your in class.

What if they had an accident and they need another pair of clothes but they don't answer from the school phone? You can just call your parents and tell them to bring you a new pair of cothes .

What if you get injured in game or playing outside? If students could take their phones to school it would be much better.

Well TEACHER_NAME
