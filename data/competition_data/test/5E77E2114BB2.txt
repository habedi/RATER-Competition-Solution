"Have you ever got cough texting in class?" Well i have many times. Are principal is reconsidering the schools no cell phone policy. We should be able to use are phones when were not in class, during lunch, or just when were not doing anything.

When we are not in class i don't see why we cant use are phone we would not be brother anybody because we would not be in class. We could just be walking down the hall. the hall ways would be a hole lot quite to because people would not be yelling.

Lets say were sitting at lunch and maybe one of your friends are sitting on the other side of the lunch room and you cant talk to them because of it well if you had your phone you could just text her and tell her whatever you were going to tell her. If you texts your friend that is all the way on the other side of the room you want get in trouble for walking over there when the rules are to stay sitting. If you text them you want get yelled at of yelling across the room.

When people are just walking around the halls or waiting before a class they should be able to text people. Lets say you have a friend that is on the other side of the school and you need to tell them something but you can not find them and it just cant wait so you text them see that's a lot better then haven to wait till the end of the day because you can tell them everything that you need to tell them and you don't for get any thing.

"So do you think we should be able to text in class?" I have told you what i think so what do you think should we be able to text just not in class, at lunch, or when we are just doing whatever.
