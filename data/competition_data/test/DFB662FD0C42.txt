The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great idea. There are a lot of reasons you should join I will give you some reasons. This really should make you want to sign up right after you read it.

You are helping innocent people who servived any war, because it was left in ruins. Anyboby who joined got to go around the world for free to help people. If you have some free time you could even go sight-seeing. You could just see the happiness on an innocent child or adult to lighten your day up. If you like animals you could be around them all day long.

Luke once said "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acroplis in Greece was special," he aslo said . " So was taking gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water." Luke got toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal while he was on his way to China.

If you go it's not like your the only person on the boat with a whole lot of animals. You can even have some of your friends sign up with you and that is even better. Just think of it like your on a boat with a lot of every people getting ready to help people. Every one else on the boat can become your friends so it's not just you and some strangers it's you a whole lot of your friends.

In conclusion, I think anyboby who could should be a Seagoing Cowboy. You will always make one more person in the world happy. You get to go sight-seeing in your free time. You will stories to tell your friends and family.
