If I worked at NASA and someone I know told me he/she beleive it was created by aliens I would tell that person to look at the facts. It shows in the picture and article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars","hugh rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth." While other people still think today that the picture was formed by aliens I have this to say.

"Why in the world will an alien was its time making a human face when they have never even seen a human before unless one came on earth." In my point of view I personal do not belivie in aliens but I do belive that that ''face'' in Mars was a hoax. Like I said before I know that that face is a mountain that was accidental formed to created a human mask face. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. " That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars."

The mask itself is nautural formed the shadows just happenedly popped showed up in those spots and here on Earth weird things happen but does not mean that an alien did it. The fact, the edivence is all showed in the article and picture that it was a rock/mountain that formed a mask face if a human.
