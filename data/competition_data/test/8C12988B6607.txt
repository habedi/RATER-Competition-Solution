dare princpal i think policy 1 is more fare to the students because sometime when a students forget something they might need to call their mom or dad for something they need.

For a good reason sometime kids forget their lunch money and they don't want to go up to the because they do not want to get a pass. Or they don't want to walk all the way up their.

If you where a student you would not want to walk to the ti the student window and sometimes their a line. Plus maybe a friend or your girlfriend is out of town and your need to tell him/her something about to days homework . But you know your could take it way if their like class and they do not have the permission to do so. Like when their a test you can get a bag and go around and take everyone's phone just to make sure no one is get the answers. So that why I think policy 1 is better then policy 2. But with policy 2 their always people how will do it anyway and then the teacher fins out then that get detention and more then 10 then ten kids a day got in trouble so let just make easy for everybody and let us use it at lunch or when the teacher said its ok to use them .
