Dear principal,

I think we should do community service because it helps the Earth stay clean. It helps to give back to the community and it's better to then to do nothing. when I hear people say that they don't want to do community service it makes think that they want to live in a town that's dirty and polluted. by doing community service we're keeping are town clean, and not dirty. Most people might have better things to but if they spend at least twenty minutes helping the community they will see the impact that they have to convince other people to help. Some people still might not like it but some will change their mind. When I help someone it makes feel good giving back, that's why I want people to help, so they can feel good giving back.

Some forms of community service is that people clean up litter, clean spray paintings. They're some people that tutor middle school kids, practice sports or other activities. As you can see they're plenty of way to help out the community. I hope you do assign the community service.

Your Friend
