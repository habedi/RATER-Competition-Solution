My name is PROPER_NAME, I'm a scientist at the NASA, I research and deal with science matters. I've been researching the Faces on Mars, I have so much research and I've been working on this for awhile now. So right now I'm going to be talking about me trying to convince someone that the Faces on Mars is just a landform.

Today, I'm meeting with a guy who wants to know more about these face/landforms on Mars, so today I'm going to sit with the guy and talk with him. Well the guy comes in and he's wanting to know all these things about the faces on Mars, and then I interuppted him and said, "did you know those are landforms" and he replaid, "no those are faces." So then i was like can you give me any information explain why you think those are faces and he said because I've say people saying that on the interent.

I said, "Well that's what people are saying on the internet, so it might not always be true. So here is some information that I've researched about the landforms on Mars that might make you think diffrently. There has been pictures taken of the landforms from 1976,1998 and 2001, and yes they kind of look like faces but they are landforms. NASA defends what people are saying about the faces on Mars. Yes, peple think that there is life on Mars,but how would the faces on Mars prove that? The guy then says yeah I understand were your coming from. The guy then says yes, I guess your right about them being landform. It really didn't take much convincing. Before the guy left he said Thanks. After doing all that I went ahead and did more research just so if I found more about the landforms, then I could call the guy and let him know what's going on.
