Dear State Senator,

Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be a better choice. Keeping Electoral College to me me would mean a crash in the system. Also when you vote you would not be voting for the president,but for a State of Electors, who in turn elect the president. In my opinion is one of these elections the Electoral College systems would crash due too the State Legislatures are responsible for picking the electors and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Plus the State of Electors have too much power thats horrible ,because if the State of Electors where to decides on another candiate there vote would count more than the people. Which would lead to the people to get angry because you voted and many other voted for the same one but it all comes down too what the State of Electors say. I'm not the only one that has this opinion. According to the a Gallup poll on 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore, won the popular vote but lost thepresidency. Over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have know. All we need State Senator is a good system because eventually this system that we have right know will eventualy crash.Â
