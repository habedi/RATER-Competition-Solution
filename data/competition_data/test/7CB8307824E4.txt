Gas is harmful to mother nature. The use of Gas has increased more and more every year. have you ever came to think what can we do to prevent, or help the reduction of fossil fuels? in the united states and around the world people everyday are helping to reduce the amount of polution that goes into the air we breath. communities and legislators are acting on this important cause for our globe. The earth is our home and we need to take more care of it.

Fellow citizens what can we all do to fight polution? think about it... would it be that bad limiting car usage? we can spend more time getting healthy, like takeing a jog to the nearest fast food place to eat a burger, going to publix to buy the milk, or maybe to pick up your sibling from school? what if one day out of the week you instead of takeing the car to go to school you can easily walk or take a bus anything can help out the enviorment. Don't you get tired on waiting on red lights or on slow going traffic? you see walking you dont have to be in so much congestion on the road. You can walk with family,friends,your dog or even to spend quality time with yourself to get away from home.

limiting car usage can relive stress and stop you from being so tense.
