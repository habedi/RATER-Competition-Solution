Many schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning although they're not in school. These projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. There are many reasons on why it should be the students choice and not the teachers.

Many examples can help explain why summer projects should be student designed. For example, projects require a lotÂ of work and time. Student's time, especially the summer. Students believe summer is their time to get away and enjoy themselves without having to worry about grades or failing a class. Teachers assign books or projects that they believe are whats best for students. That's why many students never actually do their summer reading or any summer assignments. The projects be boring and long. If teachers assign a book to read over the summer, students should be able to pick their own book to read or research, after all it's their time and freedom on the line.

If students were able to choose their own topic or own projects, they're more likely to do them. Mainly because they're doing something they want to do. A book or project they chose to research or read about. Its in their interest. When something is interesting for a student they're more likely to keep up with it. Who wants to waste their free time doing something they don't want to do or that doesn't interest them? A lot of kids never open or touch a summer project, let alone complete one. The summer is meant for kids to enjoy themselves, live their life a little without any worries, the one time they can actually enjoy themselves rather than two weeks off for a break and jumping right back into school and real life problems. It's where they can actually enjoy being a kid, staying out all night, being with friends constantly, or family whom they never see during school. These summer projects can prevent a lot of that, especially when parents be hard on students to complete a assignment they're not interested in. It's extremely difficult to try to get in the correct head space and force yourself to do something you don't want to.

Although it's always the possibility that students may not do the work even if they choose their assignment, schools would get more participation than before. If schools don't at least try, how would they know? Even if it's not every student, as long as more participate and try. Some turn out is better than none at all. Even with all the freedom and option to choose their assignment, its always that handful who just don't care enough to complete a summer assignme

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed. It's their time, effort and work going into it so they should have the opportunity to choose their own projects. There are many more reasons on why this should be allowed.
