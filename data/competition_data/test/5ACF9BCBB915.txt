Dear State Senator,

The purpose of me writing to you is because, i agree that we should change the way we vote for our president. Everyone has a right to vote but dont you think a easy prosses would be much bette? there are many reasons i disagree with using Electoral Collage but there are way to many reasons so im only going to give a three. my three reasons on why we should not you eletoral college is because the prosses, the problems, and finally because its old.

The electoral collage lets be honest is a huge big unfair process. There are very many steps to the Electoral collage and i belive there are many more ways we can vote. Picking the hardest one in my personal opion is just not to bright. We should have a easy way to help the people running the electoal collage and also help the citizens. There are many resons why doing this wil;l halp the process so we will have our president voted faster.

The eletoral collage has very many problems in its system. a few of them are that when the citizens vote they are not voting for the president they are voting for the elcetors who vote for the presidents. Another reason is Eletoral collage is very unfair. The peeople or the electors that are voting are not always the right ones also depending on which side you are on rpublican or the decmocratic sometimes een for example you are a republican one of your electors could be democratic as i said before very unfair.

Finally everyone gets tired of crummy old boring things! Have you ever hear it is good to try new things? lets face it the system is really old. I believe would shold try differant methods of selecting the president. If for any reason it does not work out we can always try something else or go back too the same way. i belive that we should try something new and not the same old boring unfair way we have been using for years.

All in all i belive  that we should change the way we vote for the president. This eletoral collage from my understaning is not something we should keep using. As i said there are to many reason that i would have to write down but here are my three reasons to change the way we vote. First the prosses of picking the president, second the problems that the eletoral college has, and last because the system is old and needs to change so, no that you have read this are you going to help me and everyone else change this system?

in my respect, PROPER_NAME
