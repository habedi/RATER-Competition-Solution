The Author describe how you can see emotions in the image of Monalisa. Many peaple can to think that the Monalisa is happy because she's smile but she can have fews emotions in the same moment. Leonardo Da Vinci's try to speak in this image that the emotions is how a mirror. Is for this the Author speak in the article that Lonardo Da Vinci probably knows study the emotion of person. I think you can see the emotios the other peaple because the face is how a mirror. you can look how you feeling in the moment. Is you are tired, sick, sad, happy, disgusted...

But sometimes we can't see all the emotions, because Monalisa looks that she is happy but she can feel others emotions that you can't see maybe.

My conclusion is you can see the emotions in the face but NO all the emotions.

This happen with the expressions of my classmate they look very serious for the exam, others look tired but they maybe can be others emotions that I don't know.
