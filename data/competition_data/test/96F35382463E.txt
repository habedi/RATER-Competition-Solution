World War II was a very difficult time in the world.

Many contries were destroyed and grew weak. Europe was effected by it the most.

Contries such as Germany, France and Poland were devestated by the effects.

The seagoing cowboys helped many of these contries rebuild there animal, economy, and farms.

World War II destroyed 15 diffrent contries.

Many of the contries lost lots of thier crops and farms. Without thier farms they can't get food or vegitables.

The Seagoing Cowboys bring Horses and cows and other live staocks to these contries.

They give theses cntries an extra boost in growing back there farms.

The Seagoing Cowboys program takes ordinary ranchers and bring them and horse cows and other livestock and bring them to other contries.

They also bring hay and feed so they can feed them while they are on the boat.

While you are at the contries you are allowed to visit some sites on you free time.

So while you work you can alway plan your next trip. Stated in paragraph 5 it talks about the benifets of traveling to all these diffrent places.

Have you every been in need of help and you had that lonly feeling.

That is the same feeling that these people have.

They feel lonely and abandoned. The Seagoing Cowboys take away that feeling and relace it with joy. They make foriegn farmers happy that they can finally farm and take care of their animals.

The program helps so many people in so many ways.

Yes, it might be hard to leave home, and go to another country, and work. The feeling of helping people fills that heart with a much better and richer feeling-the feeling of love.

In the end all your hard work will pay off and you can sit don knowing you did a good thing.
