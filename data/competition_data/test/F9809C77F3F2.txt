Venus which is sometimes called an "Evening Star," is one of the brightest point of light in t he night sky. Venus is a member in our solar system. Venus is a Planet. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it have approved many challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is worthy to pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space many humans have sent numerous spacecraft to this land but th missions are always been unmanned and as a result no spac craft has survived on this land for more than few hours. Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus for more than three decades. This is not only affecting the waste of money but also losing people's lives.

The thick atmosphere on Venus is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The clouds are highly corrosice sulfuric acid in Venus's atomosphere. On the planet's surface the temperature avarages over 800 degress Farenheit, and the atmosphereic pressure is 90 times higher than what we experience on Earth. These temperature are more than enough to harm any human being who tries to go to Venus. After all these results scientists should not discuss further to visit the surfafce of Venus.

Many astronomers are shocked because once Venus used to like Earth. Large areas covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a solution for sending humans back on surface on Venus which would allow scientists to float above the fray like imagine a blimp-like vhecile hovering 30 or some miles above the rolling Venusian landscape just like our airplanes. This will avoid the a little less teperatue affects. It is challenging and hard.

Striving to meet this challenge presented by Venus has value. Even thought

NASA is trying to find the best solution to go on Venus still, we can't forget in past many people have lost their lives and the mission has been unsuccesful. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
