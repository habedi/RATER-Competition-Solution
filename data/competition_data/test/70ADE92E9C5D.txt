Should drivers be allowed on their phone during driving? For my input and opinion I disagree entirely. My personal reason for this is because studies show that being on your phone while driving is a distraction. Everyone else has their own opinion and entirely different perspective and I can see how they would want phones to be legal. As I read more into the use of phones while driving I am introduced to more negatives then positives just because it pulls your attention off the road and even makes you take one hand off the steering wheel. So should drivers be allowed on their phone while driving?

My first reason for why people should not be on their phone would be distractions. Distractions meaning phone calls, face timing, and snap catting. All of the reason i gave are incredibly popular in today's youth and society. As a young and maturing person I use these apps or applications to my benefit when wanting to converse with friends and family. Driving and doing any of those is incredibly dangerous cause it takes your attention off the road and makes you even take a hand off the wheel.

My other reason for not agreeing with having a phone with driving is because it's not just a dangerous thing for you but also for others. In a scenario where two people are at a red light and the person in front is on their phone then how could they know the light is green? It all comes down to the person behind them if they are willing to wait or honk there horn at them. Scenario's like that because fender benders cause now picture if the light turned green and the person just pulled up a little bit and hit the person. Now the person on the phone is at fault for being a reckless driver and interfering with traffic safety laws.

Do people driving need to use their phone even if they think it's an emergency? People need to realize that if it is an absolute emergency and they need to answer it then pull over to the side of the road. Most people fail to realize that most phone and car accidents is because someone couldn't just put their phone down for more than five seconds to focus on whether or not the light is green or red. In my opinion and for recent studies that showed it I disagree with using your phone while driving and I feel as if it is a well-deserved law that people should not be on their phone while driving.
