Today cars is one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions in the world.  Limiting car usage would be very benificial for today and future generations.

To start off there is many advantages to limit car use.  One example would be "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."  In Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day every year.  A lot of people participate in it and some enjoy it. With that day it lowers car mission and shows people that cars aren't nessary to have.  Another example would be, "When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way."  Without cars people are happier and aren't as stressed as they would be if they still had a car.

Next life can go on without cars.  One example would be "Vauban, Germany- Residents of this upscale community are suburban pionners: they have given up their cars."  In this community there is little to no parking spaces.  The community is tightly packed together so that it is better to walk places.  Not only are their car free suburbas but cars are on a decline. An Example would be, "Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and gettiong fewer licenses as each year goes by."  Even in America cars are starting to decline.  Teens and young adults aren't getting their licenses and dont have to get it as a priority.

The world of cars is changing and the way cities are planned is with it.  The reduction of car use will help lower greenhouse gas emissions for the future generations on Earth.
