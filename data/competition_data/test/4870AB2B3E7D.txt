I think policy is what everyone is going to choose because almost everyone has phones. If you were allowed to have phones in school, you would not be social. It would all becoming from the phone. The only time you would talk is in class when its not your turn to talk. People would get in more trouble by talking when the teacher is talking, and so forth. If I was allowed to use my phone during lunch time, I would get use to it and bring it to class and get it taken away. If someone was late, I'm sure the teacher would blame the phone so they could take it from you.

Some people that don't have phones might vote for policy 2 because they will fill left out of conversations with their friends. I didn't have my phone for a long time because I got it taken away. Everyone would think I don't have a phone but I wouldn't care. Phones are pointless to me unless i need to communicate with somebody. I might have a project due tomorrow and my partner would be having a good conversation about the project and how they are going to get an "A" on their project which i did myself. That has happened to me before but I found out so I did two projects. My friend was on his phone so much and I did it all.

I don't think phones should be allowed at school because we will be distracted. I think phones are worthless like I said before but they are important to most people to day. In my opinion, I say policy 2 because I don't have a cell phone right now because of my grades. Also because I lost the charger.
