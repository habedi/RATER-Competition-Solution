Summer projects are a good idea to keep student's active and learning throughout the summer. They can be beneficial for some core classes such as math, history, and english, but can also be tedious and stressful during a break that should be relaxing. Haiving good intentions in mind, teachers creating summer projects for challenging courses try to make them doable and a low intesity learning experience. Even so, it does not always seem that way to the students who dread them and push them off until the last week of summer. Summer projects should be student designed because it is the students' learning, their grade is dependent upon the work, and sometimes a teacher will present too much work.

Whether or a not a student wants to learn is completely their choice, and they will deal with the positive and negative effects. For example, some students think that having a summer project for a challenging course is pointless because they will likely just forget everything by the start of the school year. This can prove to be true, or it can lead to their struggling grades and other consequences. Very few people actually want to do work over summer break, so it is up to the student to decide what is important to them and how they want to prepare for school. Some students do well with shorter reviews, while others need long practices to relearn what they did not understand. Students should design summer projects so that they can customize them to their individual needs.

Along with the negative consequences a student must understand that their grade in the class is dependent upon how much work they do over them summer, so designing the summer project would be beneficial in helping them improve. Most classes that require summer assignments start off the in the first quarter with an assumption that they students completely understand the material that was supposed to be covered over the summer. With most classes, a student will skip around the summer asignment and just try to do the things they need to work on, jumbling knowledge up in their head as they try to organize themselves. Understanding what they need to work on, the students can design a summer projet that would help in areas of weakness in hopes of improving their school grades. This will be helpful in the future because the students can individually learn and then bring what they have learned throughout the summer back to the classroom and help others.

Lastly, in designing summer projects, teachers tend to compile a ton of needless work that none of the students do. For instance, in an AP class the teacher usually thinks that they more you practice the better you will get, which is usually true. Because of this mindset they will put together pages of practice tests, and notes for a student to complete throughout the summer causing absolute chaos and a huge amount of stress. Despite practice making perfect, no one wants to fill out papers over the summer. Since the students know their workload from other classes and what they are capable of, they can put together a decent amount of work that is not too long. If the students were to design summer projects they would be more inclined to do them because it would not be such a tedious amount of work.

Even though teachers make summer projects because they design the learning plan for the year, students would get much more out of them if they made them together because of the learning aspect that comes with it. Students should design them because they would be able to identify their weaknesses collectively, and create practices that would help them in the future. This is much better than teachers compiling useless, terrifying tests from randomn websites that are pushed off until the last week of summer.
