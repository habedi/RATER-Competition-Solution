The Seagoing Cowboys program is for helping people who need food after World War one. The program sends people who sign up to go on boats and take care of animals until they get to the spot where they are supposed to get off.

Luke had been working two part time jobs and his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He didn't say no because it was an opportunity of his lifetime. The program was to give countries supplies to recover food. The UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)employed seagoing cowboys totake careof horses, young cows,and mules.

Luke and Don(his friend) had went to New Orleans to get their seaman's papers then went to Greecewith a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. luke turned 18 before he got to Greece and was able to be drafted for the millitary. When he got drafted an dfound out what he was doing they told to keep doing that for his service.
