I think the face reading software would be good for educational purposes. I don't think that using the face reading software would be good for places everywhere, though. The software could help teachers with what they should be teaching and with how they need to plan their lessons. The face reading software could help students express their emotions and feelings to their teachers. Overall I think that the face reading software would benefit the learning environment, because it would benefit teachers and students.

Using the software in the classroom could help teachers keep things exciting and interesting for their students. In paragraph 6, from the excerpt, it states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." The software could help a teacher learn about what the students are interested in and what they don't understand, and need more work on. I don't think the technology should spread to everywhere in the world, such as to airports. If the machine misreads a face it could send the wrong kind of impression to those working at the airport. If places use the technology, they should also keep their basic security. The face reading technology could keep the learning environment more interesting and more up to date.

In conclusion, the face reading technology could and would benefit our learning environment everywhere. The technology would help teachers improve on their teaching techniques and lessons. I think it would help benefit kids that don't like to openly express their emotions with their teachers. The technology should be used wisely and should be well planned and processed. The world is advancing and our learning environment should be advancing as well.
