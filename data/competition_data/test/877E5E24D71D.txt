Dear Principal,

I personally think or believe that students should do or practice community service because it will make them better people and better students. My first reason of writing this letter to let you know that you should make students do community service is that if students do community service they will learn to care and cherish our surroundings. My second reason for this is that many elderly people can benefit from the youth's helping them out in something they can't do or something they can't do as well as they used to. My third example is that if students pre-form community service hours they will also fell good about themselves not being so selfish and assisting other people. Another reason of why community service will be a good thing is because it will help our community become a better, cleaner, more sanitary, and a more desirable place to visit, and live in. My last and final example is that if students do community service it will look very good on a college or a job application that they turn in.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
