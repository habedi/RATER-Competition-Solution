There is a new software that has been made to perceive the emotions of others. According to the article titled "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D' Alto, The Process begins whe the computer constructs a 3-D computer of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This software is an innovation from Prof, Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Sciense at the University of Illiniois. Also Dr Paul Eckman, creator of FACTS (Facial Action Coding System) classified six basic emotions such as, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.

I think this new software would make a good change in schools as they could read students' emotional expressions. Based on what I read from the article, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored,Dr Huang predicts. This computer software then could change the lesson, like an effective human instructor. One example is thet, Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) rases your eyebrows when you are surprised.

Well, this new software that has been made to perceive the emotions of others, could be very helpful in schools as they would be able read students' emotional expressions. This will lead teachers and even parents to know how the person is feeling about school or in other aspexcts. Each student would have a different emotional expression, and teacher or other people to help the ones that are really confused or angry about somthing.
