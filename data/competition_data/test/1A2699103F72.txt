Dear Principal,

I strongly think that community service is a great thing for children. If you required for all the students to perform in community service, then it would help the community out and even help the students out at home. For example, if a student had to clean up litter daily then they would realize it makes the community more neat and clean and they would start picking up around their own neighborhood. If that was the case, then there would be a bigger population in the town because many family's would want to come to a neat and clean town. The students who don't think community service is a good idea then once they do it a few times, they will realize that community service is very helpful to their community and their selves. Everyone would be very appreciated to have a clean neighborhood and like to see that there was no trash around the interstate or the roads. The tutoring also would be a great idea for the students. The parents would like that very well because the students would most likely bring up all of their poorly grades they have on their report card. Also to this idea, you would have a very good reputation of your school because all of the students would bring up their grades. This also would help out all of the teachers so they wouldn't have to go over the lesson several times a day. So it would make their job much easier with them knowing it from being tutored. The students would be glad too, getting to watch the T.V more often then what they do from always being grounded. The community service in that way would help the students out when they get older. There are many other ideas for community service you could also do as well. For example, cleaning the bathrooms at school, helping teachers out when they need help, helping the cafeteria ladies make lunch, or making sure all of the students cleaned up their mess after they ate lunch or breakfast. I believe that requiring community service for all students would be a great idea for all of the students in school.

Sincerely,
