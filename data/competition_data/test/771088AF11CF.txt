The reason why I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because i think it would be fun to do all the things that they do and to help out the people. And to take care of the animals like it said in paragraph 6 It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. But like it said in paragraph 9 But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. Im grateful for the opportunity, he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.
