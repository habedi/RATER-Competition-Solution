Dear Principal,

I think you should have a requirement that all students should have to do a certain amount of community service that they need in order to pass the grade. Even if its just painting a bench or helping around the school. I think students should care more about the community and not just about themselves. Maybe if it just for about fifteen minutes once a week, go to a soup kitchen and help out or go to the beach and pick up litter after school. Even if they see litter on the ground just pick it up to be nice to the environment and the community.

I feel that students don't care about the environment, but they would if they knew the future was in there hands, they would help out more. If they did help out then the world may not end so soon or when they are adults they may not regret helping the community because the community would be in better shape. Everywhere they look, there will be no litter, because they did a good job helping the community and they would teach there kids to help out to around the community. If they didn't help then the world may end sooner or they may regret it when they grow up. Also soon they will not be able to swim in the ocean because there will be to mush pollution in the water. I know that i wouldn't like that, so that means a lot of other people wouldn't like it either. Also there kids wouldn't help the environment so the world would get even more polluted.

Also if they help out around the school then maybe if there kids go here then they may have a better education because they don't need to worry about the community or the environment.

This is why i think you should have every student do a least 90 minutes of community service. For the world ends up better. You should make it for they don't pass the grade or something if they don't do the service.

Thank you!!

Have a great day!
