How many times have you stepped out of your comfort zone? Maybe once or twice? People always hold back in life from doing something they have wanted to do. Maybe they are scared or fear of being judged. They don't take opportunities when they have it and might regret it later. Having to do another extracurricular activity could open so many doors, for example, meeting new friends, trying something new, and maybe even finding something you're really good at.

You know when you meet a new friend, you're so excited and can't wait for all the fun things you guys will do together! If you did an extracurricular you could have so many of these moments. Making new friends expands your friend group. You can meet people that you probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been pushed to stretch your horizons. And all these people can introduce you to new things that they are interested in like their favorite movie, books, or even their own friends. You could do the same. At this point you might even have double the friends you had before you even did this extracurricular, wouldn't that be fun! Making new friends is just one of the many aspects of trying something new!

For most people their is always that one thing they want to try but never do. Maybe chorus, art, robotics, etc. When you do this extracurricular you finally get the chance to do that one thing you've always had in the back of your mind. Say you tried this new thing, you put in your all in it, and you didn't like it or you weren't good at it. That's OK! Now you know that you tried it. You have no regrets. And you're probably going to have fun along the way even if it didn't end up being your passion. Doing this extracurricular could get you to the activity you always wanted to do even if it's not your life's calling.

My dad always says, "Don't knock it till you try it.". Which basically means don't say you don't like it till you have given it a shot. This applies to so many things like sports, food the list goes on. This activity that you try could be what your really talented at. Maybe not given the opportunity you have never tried it. That would be so sad, getting a talent and you don't even know that you have it. That would just be a waste! If you get an opportunity like this it could lead to many things and even find what you were meant to do.

Trying something new, making friends, and discovering what you're really good at is just a few of the possibilities if you do an extracurricular. Trying something different could open your world, and make you see things in a different light that maybe you looked down on before. You could finally find that one interest that you've been waiting for. And maybe that you're really good at too! Having to do another extracurricular helps you find friends and broadens your friend group! I really think that adding an extracurricular will benefit teens in many ways and really make them branch out which they probably weren't doing in the first place.Â
