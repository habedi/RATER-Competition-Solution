Most students do not do summer projects due to the fact that students do not find the topics of summer projects interesting. Many teachers usually choose projects students have no interest in, which is the probable cause of why students do not usually do their summer projects. Having summer projects that are based off the students interest can increase the chances of students doing their projects. If students start doing their projects; students would continue learning over break, enjoy the topic assigned, and increase the chances of doing other projects that could be assigned.

Summer projects are meant to have students continue their learning even when on break. A project is still a project, whether it is teacher-designed or student designed. The difference between the teacher-designed and the student-designed is that if it is teacher-designed, students usually do not do them because there is nothing interesting about it, but for student-designed projects there will be a much likelier chance of students doing the project based off the topic they want to choose, they are still learning over break so why not make it something students can also enjoy. Over the years that I have been in school I have found it much easier and enjoyable to do projects I know would be interesting to me. I get to research and write about something I find so fascinating instead of doing a project on something that has never caught my interest.

Enjoying the topic assigned to students can be a very big benefit because, students start showing passion and enthusiasm in their project that they have never shown before in any other projects. Researching in a topic that I would want to know more about can make me feel confident, enthusiastic, and passionate in my project rather than researching about a topic I never knew existed.

Many teachers only give projects that are based off of the subject they teach, but not every student finds that subject interesting, that subject can be their weakest subject and to have projects assigned to continue learning for students over break will not benefit them. Giving out a project that they would enjoy and mixing it with the subject the teacher teaches can help the student without the student realizing. After giving out projects the students would enjoy, the likelihood of the students doing other projects assigned will be high.

In other words, student-designed projects can benefit both students and teachers because students will do the projects assigned. The students will be given a topic that is unique and interesting to them which can cause them to be confident in their project, they will also be learning while working on the project, and give them many ideas for their next project. Let us not forget that on the other hand, teachers may assign projects that are teacher-designed because they know it will benefit students in ways they would not be able to understand yet. It can expand the knowledge of students, open up a new topic they never knew about and could find interesting, and it can help teachers see where their students are struggling. Everything is done with a reason.
