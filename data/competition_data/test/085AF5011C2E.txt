Dear principal, i believe that changing the policy to requiring student at least to have a B average to play sports would be wrong for many reasons. One of the many reasons would be that many students are GREAT at playing sports and they are not as good in two or three subjects, so they wouldn't be able to play. I also think that if people really wanted to play they should keep their grades up, but most don't.

For Example, say that we are in the championship game in football and are star quarterback couldn't play because he failed his science test, which means we would have to put are second string quarterback in. We would lose it and it would be great for our school to win a game for a change. Do you really think that it would improve are scores? I don't think so because then all of the boys off the football team or any other team this would happen to will quit then we will have to play second string the hole time, so really it wouldn't help. It might to some people but if you ask me it wouldn't change a thing.

I think that you should try to convince yourself and the school board that requiring students to have a C average to play sports is a good thing for the school. I would also help if we could have a good education and have a good football, softball, basketball, and track team. Thanks for your time while reading this!

Thanks
