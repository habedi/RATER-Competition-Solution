The author did a pretty good job explaining everything about Venus and all of this stuff about outer space. He said some very powerful things within this artical that should be changed in this wolrd and some should not be changed. The way he put everything into his own thoughts before just outting it out in the wolrd he had done a lot of reaserch about all of Venus and the planets.

I well enough think that he did a very good job at explaining everything about Venus and how the earth works. When the author states " our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edge" he is saying that even if there is danger in this world you shoudl never run away form it you should take a risk. The authour has some very good points on why you shouldnt be scared of this earth and all the new things happening with Venus and all the planets.

When the author was talking about the computers we should use on the planets and the new hovering saftly to the planets instead of taking rocket or a plan. That would be a good idea to try because with the hovering system you can get closer to the planets more than you can if you take a rocket or a plan all the way up there. It may not be as safe as taking a rocket up there because tou are more open being able to get hit by things up there. But with the new technology he is trying to use and to bring back that could honestly work becase the computers and tech that we are using today you cant take up there becasue there are no cell towers.

What the author is trying to do is a good idea and they way he explained everythung was super good to because he had so many reasons on what you could do to make it easier on everyone that has to go up in outter soace and work. He had a reason to back up everything that he was saying anf that is what is going to make people think that this is a good idea to start using diffrent things in this world.
