Is it or isn't it? I think that it isnt. There are too many reasons why it is just a landform and not a human. For example it says "A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all of us to see. The caption noted "huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head" this is why I think it is a landform.

Another reason I think it is a landform is because as we got closer to the ground of Mars is got clearer and clearer. It came out to be a mesa. In the 70's they didn't have to best cameras so it looked a little blury and came out to be a face.

As cameras got better and better it became clearer and clearer. If they were to do it today they would really see what it was. The text says "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added. "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"

This means that it was proven that it was a land form. If it was a human or a living creature we would be able to tell. Some people think it was a conspirasy. I think it was because if it wasn't we would still be looking at it.

So people can think what they want but I think it was a landform. Is there life or Mars? If there is will we ever know?
