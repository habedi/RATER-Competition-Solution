Dear Principal,

Cell phones are the thorn in the side of teachers and other school officials. They pop up in class, at lunch, in the library, and of course in the hallway. They're everywhere, there's no way you can enforce a no cell phone policy. You can not find every abuser and when they don't get caught, it encourages them to do it again. However if you give students a tiny amount of cell phone freedom, I am positive they will be less likely to text during math class.

Allowing cell phone use during free time can be used no just for personal use, but for educational use as well. There is an app on the i phone that allows you to make flash cards.

studying on the i touch is much more appealing than flipping pieces of paper. Technology can encourage students study and to do more to ace that English test they have. If there is any way to help students learn I believe we should use it.

Emergencies aren't planned, that's why we call them emergencies. So why take away what could be a student's last chance in an emergency? We all know that the school phone lines can get backed up pretty bad and sometimes there is no time to waste. If your parents had a car accident and they are trying to call you, you would want to have a cell phone. If you are being forced to do something or you have seen someone you know doing something at school that is illegal or dangerous, you need to have a connection to the school. A cell phone is that connection. Don't you think that students need that extra line of protection?

I think it's extremely worthwhile to have safety just a call away.

Having a no cell phone policy at all sounds like a great plan and no doubt it would be, if there was any way to control rules like that. Students will find a way to use their cell phones no matter what you tell them. Under jackets, books, and desks , a teacher can't catch them all. Each one that doesn't get caught encourages another to do the same thing. Even with dire consequences there is no way to ensure public obedience. Giving students a taste of freedom helps satisfy their longing. They won't yearn to use their cell phones if they just finished texting during the last locker stop. To get anything you have to learn to compromise, give a little take a little.

As you can see because of countless reasons a cell phone policy including allowance at free time is clearly the right choice. It's the only way to go to get the most out of what you want. Sure, there will be some times when the policy is ignored by students, but it will happen less than it would with a no cell phone plan policy. Help your students continue to learn and smile the way they need to in order to grow up smart and happy. Use this cell phone plan and watch the results with your very own eyes, I'm positive you won't believe them.
