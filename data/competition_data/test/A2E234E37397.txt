The author supports the claim in a very understandable factor. It plays a part in the story to inform you more knowledge about Venus.

The author is basically telling you what he knows, explaining the subject may be easy to read , but you wants you to understand it too. For example, when he said "A thick atmosphere of 97 percent co2 blankets Venus." Then giving you an supporting detail to where you could understand the meanning of his statement. The author obviously studies a big part of his work to infrom and coclude with lots of details in the story , thats the great big meaning of the supporting detail and main message of the story.

Now to conclude this paragraph , the author uses scientific purposes in the story to get his point across from. Using the knowledge he gave himself to under the the inform he was trying to do. Thats how the author supports the idea of studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite all the dangers. Thats the perfect example that fits along with my answer.
