The power to choose who is our president and who is not should be left up to the people. I belive that we cannot allow a system to decide who is president. You could even say its a sham we are told to vote for a presidential canidate yet we not even voting for them. Were voting for a set a electors and hoping that it will swing in our votes favor. The president should be elected by popular vote because we dont have a say and it is not practical.

You are told that you should go out and vote a president but your really voting for electors. when you go to vote you dont even get to see the elctors your voting for. This shouldent be allowed because the presidential canidates are the one running the camipaigns and publicity but we know nothing of the electors using the electoral collage to elect a president. Another downside to not being able to elect a president by popular vote is that the popular voted canidate can still lose due to having less electoral votes and this has happend before. Also this form of voting is not practical because in the end the people werent the deciding factor because the electoral vote is such a large one

In conclusion the way that we elect our presidents needs to change. The popular vote is a way to insure that people are getting there say in who is president. If the people see somthing wrong with a presidental canidate the peole should be able to put a stop to that and not have the chance of being overuled. The electoral college was created as a compromise it should be kept as a way to make a decision when there is no popular vote.
