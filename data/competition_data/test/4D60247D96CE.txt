Dear Principal,

Community Service takes time needed away from Students.

Students may need to go home and help out, at Home.

So they can't really help out at school, for Community Service. Students need time at home to do homework, and learn in class. Example, like if they Come to School the next day, and they Didn't do their Homework, b/c of Community service it's not their fault, that their not

Doing their homework or that they don't understand how to do the homework without learning in class. Its actually taking lots of time away from their learning, and work time. Students may have a relative, in the hospital they need to watch, or pick up their little brother or sister from school, or just babysit while your mom or a relative needs you to watch their kids.

So principal I'm asking you Do Not make all the students in the school Do Community service. Try making slips for the Students who want to do Community service like for afterschool or something.

Sincerely your student,
