Do you think students would benefit from learning from home? in my opinion I would say yes. I think distance learning is a smart and good thing for some students but there can be some cons. Not everyone is going to make it to school everyday so here are my reasons why i support this.

Imagine being sick and you can not make it to school. Instead of missing the lesson that was taught in class that day you can look up the lesson online. Of course it's not going to be the same, you will not get the same physical help as you would in a class room. But at the end of the day at least you're not missing a lesson and when you do come back to class you wont be behind with work and will be caught up just like everyone else.

For some students I feel they maybe would need their parents around to keep them going with the online class. I only say this because since you are learning from home there is no teacher to really pay attention on you and most teenage kids are always on the phone now a days and its a big distraction. So I mean there are going to be cons to having classes online. Therefore the parents have to be involved with this too. Before every online class take the student phone away or take away anything that distracts him/her and give it back to them when everything is completed.

Other than that I like and support online classes. It just all depends on the student, to be honest everyone learns different. Some kids like one on one help other kids can learn just by reading. It all depends on the student I personally think it's a great thing though if you could not make it to school because vacation, being sick, or you just dont feel like coming in. You don't have to worry about it everything that was taught in class will be online. All you have to do is take time out of your day and just get online and go through the lesson. I personally think this would benefit certain kids and it's a great thing.
