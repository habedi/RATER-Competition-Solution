The driverless cars are changing the face of today's transportation. They are an upcoming development of regular cars. There are many improvements that are being made in order for these cars to become a popular trend in the near future of public transportation. The improvemnts of these cars do, indeed have positive aspects to them. I am for the driverless cars because they can be an efficient way of transportation in the future.

The development of the driverless cars can create a positive impact on our society. The positive aspects are important for these cars because it allows for them to be more safe. "This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. this necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs." This aspect here, further explains how and why the driverless cars are a more safer use of transportation for people. Even though there are negative aspects to the driverless cars, the improvements being made can make the cars safer as well. "GM has developed driver"s seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object." These cars would be more effective because they are making drivers, themselves, more aware of what is going on around them. Regular cars today, make it difficult for people to use transportation, than driverless cars actually would. "The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus." The driverless cars are going to allow people to be worry-free about getting from place to place, as well as the amount of gas that it usually takes. To clarify, I am for these cars because they are a better way of using transportaton.

In conclusion, the driverless cars are making driving become more safe and efficient. The manufactures are aware of the changes that are going on in the society today, therefore the improvements of these cars are becoming relevant to the world around us. I am for the driverless cars because I believe that they are going to eventually shape the future of the world's public transportation system.
