Schools across the country have been implementing a method that ensures that students continue learning during their break, this method is: Summer projects. Summer projects are usually teacher-designed and inconvenient for a majority of students over the summer. There has been a great debate whether or not summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, I personally think they should be designed by students.

Often times when students are assigned summer projects they are incapable of completing them due to vacations or other activities. Students should design summer projects because they know what they are capable of completing. Some students have jobs, sports, or volunteering, which do not give them ample time to compete their summer projects. In eighth grade, I was tasked with a summer assignment, but I couldn't complete it because half of the time I either did not have internet connection or I was too busy exploring new places. If I had designed my own summer project that year, I would have been able to complete it due to the fact that I know my own schedule and capabilities

If summer projects are student-designed it would be more enjoyable for students. Students know what methods bore them and what methods do not; students can omit the methods that bore them and replace them with a more interactive methods. On the contrary, teachers are more experienced with creating projects, can ensure students are learning what is required, and know exactly what curriculum should be in summer projects.

Student-designed summer projects give students more incentive to complete them; they are more interactive and cater to students. Student-designed summer projects would be flexible and easier to comprehend for students. Ask yourself, would you want to plan your summer or let a project plan it for you?
