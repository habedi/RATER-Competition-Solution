Dear principal:

I strongly feel that we should be able to have cell phones at school and at lunch. I am for this idea because people love their cell phones and don't want to be without them.

Besides what if there was an emergency at school and you needed your phone. Sure the staff might say oh you can use the office phone. No, you wouldn't always be able to use the office phone like if the power went out or if there were to many people waiting to use the office phone. Instead it's a better idea to have your own phone. Besides the fact of what if, parents pay lots of money every month so you can have the phone. Especially in this economy we can not afford to be wasteful of money. Now a days everyone just kind of tries to one up their friends just to mess around so having a new phone could help in that too. However, I am aware of the risks such as it could break, get stolen or become a distraction Also, people like to show off their stuff to their friends but many people wouldn't do that at the risk of getting in trouble. For instance if someone came to school saying they got the new i phone and they couldn't show it off to people in fear that they would get it taken away, so if they could never show anybody people would assume that the person is a liar and that's never good for your self esteem and could lead to depression and possibly suicide. Parents also need a way to contact their kids at a number they know their child will be reached.

However,

I am sure most students and parents would agree with me on having cell phones at school because all around in my opinion its just a better idea.
