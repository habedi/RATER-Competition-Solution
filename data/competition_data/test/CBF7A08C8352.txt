Summer assignments have been a school-standard for long time. Most (if not all) honors or AP course give students summer assignments in preparation for the course. However, a conversation that has been brought to the attention of educators is whether or not students should begin to design their own summer assignments. For years now, teachers have designed these assignments with specific instructions in mind, but how would students structure these assignments? How would students create an assignment that would occupy themselves over the 3 month break? It's best to keep to tradition and let the teachers create these assignments, since teachers are professionals who know how to create proper assignments and it would prevent students from purposely making easy assignments that are made just for the sake of getting the assignment over with.

First of all, teachers know how assignments in general should be made. They know that they have to make an assignment that challenges the student in order to jog their memory on material that will be important to remember for next year's course. They design these assignments that are purposely time consuming and long so that students can pace themselves throughout the summer. It's an effective structure that works and has been done for years. It would be best if it remained the same.

Secondly, if students began to create their own summer assignments, they would create shorter and easier assignments. As a student myself, I can say without a doubt that most students do the work to get it done with. If students were ever granted the option to make their own summer assignment, then they would create an assignment that could be completed in a day. That's not to say all students would do that, but students would rather spend their summer not doing a 60 question math packet with a bunch of two part questions. So, if students were granted the option of making their own packets, then there is probably a chance that they would create assignments that are quick and easy.

In conclusion, let's just stick to tradition and let the teachers design summer assignments the way they always have, to prevent students from making easy assignments that can be done in a day and because teachers already do a fine enough job of making summer assignments. Why change how things work, when there is really no need for change. Students are students, they are the learners; so don't give them the teacher's job. If a student was ever given a chance to change how summer assignments are usually structured then they would probably abuse that position. So, let the teachers do their job, and let the students learn.
