Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you're reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. This maybe my opinion but I think many other children agree. I think you should accept policy number one. Cell phones are a very important part of the new world that we live in today. Cell phones should be allowed because they can be used to call for emergencies, parents feel more secure if they can contact their children anytime, and because not everyone has friends that are particularly in the school that they're in.

To start off, cell phones are one of the most important things to have if you're in an emergency. It's very uncommon to be in an emergency at school ,but I would prefer to have my cell phone just incase. We can have bus accidents, be in a fight , leave your house keys at home, need new clothes if you uhh... have an accident. There are all sorts of reasons! Expect the unexpected is what they might say. Emergencies are a very common reason; I know. The reason why it's usually repeated is because it's important! As principal, you must always think of the children's safety.

Continuing, parents feel a lot more secure if they can talk to their children anytime. If you have a daughter or son, you should know the feeling. Parents always ask their children to bring their cell phones with them when they're out with friends, at a relative's house, or even at home! They want to know that you're safe everywhere you go. It's a parent thing, I suppose. Also, cell phones have a contact book that saves everyone's phone number that's registered. You can't believe how many people I know that don't even know their parent's or house number! I read in a book that there has been an accident in South America that made parents uproar about cell phones in school. Now that wouldn't be pleasant, now would it?

Finally, not everyone has friends that they can see in school. They can even be in different periods than them. As a teenager, we always worry about our social life as well as academics. I have often heard from kids that they love going to school just for their friends. Some people aren't part of the 'in crowd'. The people who are, however , can talk all they want if it's during free time. I don't see any harm in that. There's no class disruptions which is a main reason why cell phones are ofte
