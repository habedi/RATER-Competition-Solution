How would you feel knowing that everytime you went to class to simply get your education that you were being monitered and scanned to see how you were feeling that day? Would you feel like your privacy was invaded? Would you feel judged? I know I personally would feel threatened and exposed. I beleive that the

Facial Action Coding System, a computer program that can identify human emotions, would have no value in a classrom because, it has no practical use in a learning enviorment such as a classroom, it would be an invasion of students privacy, and while it may not be of use in a calssroom, it could be put to use in other fields of work.

I think that this emotion identifing technology would have no practical use in a learning classroom enviorment becasuse teachers have to ensure the material is digested by students no matter what emotinal state they are in. While recogonizing a students emotions could expalin why they may be uninterested in the material it does not change the fact that they still must learn it if they want to further their own education. Therfore, I beleive that this technology would be of no use to both the student and the teacher.

I also beleive that this technology would have no practical use or value in a classroom due to its nature, its a blatant invasion of privacy. Its unfair to the student to be subjected to this indentification of emotion everyday. Some students may feel like their privacy is being invaded just so a teacher could know how they were feeling at that exact moment. Furthermore, students may not want their emotional state to be regonized due to personal reasons such as not wanting others to know they are feeling sad or depressed becasue they don't want others to know becsause they would attempt to reach out and that alone could result in unwanted conflict. This leads me to beleive that this technology holds no value in a classroom.

Finally, I beleive that while this technology may have no practical use or value in a calssroom, it could be put to great use in other fields of work and other aspects of life. For example, in the article researchers use this technology to decipher the emotions of the famous Mona Lisa. This helps them get an understamding of how much the artist knew about facial muscles and expressions, which is useful in learning about how artist learned thier techniques in the past. This technology would be amazing in the enteratinment industry. Futhermore, it could be used for more acurate CGI, which would be useful for movies, tv shows, and video games. Next, I beleive that this technology would be useful for scientific studies. It could help reseraches understand how emotions work and formulate which could help people who have issues with muscles in their face, technology could be developed that could help them express themselves better. Anothe reason why I believe this technology could be put to more practical use in a diffrerent enviorment then a classrom is the applications and uses it could have in solving crimes. Police could use this tech to help decpiher how a criminal is feeling which could bring more evidence to a case.

While this amazing technolgy has many applications outside the classroom, I believe that it has no practical use inside a classroom becaue it has no effect on learning the subject matter in a more efficent manner, and it be an invasion of privacy to the students and possibly the teachers as well. We area already studied and invaded enough by higher ups and people beyond and in the goverment, do we really need our students emotions in a classroom to be put under a microscope as well?
