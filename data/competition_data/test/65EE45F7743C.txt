Phones & Driving

To begin with, today I am going to be talking about texting & driving some people do it anyways. That is why I am going to be talking about it and try to prevent it from happening. Many people die from what they do while driving and do not come out alive. Now that they got a law where you cannot drive and have the phone in your hand if you do then you will get a ticket.

However, should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Answer is no they should not be able to use one while driving. Because Studies show that driving while talking on a cell phone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a four times greater risk of a crash. Talking on a cell phone may be less distracting than some other activities people may engage in while driving. Other figures suggest that someone stupid enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.

One the other hand, and despite those dangers, how often do people do it? Using sensor data from more than 3 million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of trips, driving analytics company Zen drive found drivers are using their phones on 88 percent of their journeys. People still consider drunk driving as more dangerous than texting while driving. Yet the likelihood of an accident while using the mobile phone is six times bigger than the likelihood of DUI accidents. More than 25% of car accidents in the United States are due to texting while driving.

Therefore, so how dangerous is texting and driving? Texting and driving is a combination that has produced numerous accidents on the road, with a frightening number resulting to fatalities. There are Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. So don't text and drive.

In conclusion, despite the laws forbidding texting and driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text and drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put down the phone and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing that drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people and we lose lives every day because of careless drivers.
