Cars are beginig to come to be a big issue. They are causing so many disadvantages to overpopulated and average populated areas of the world. If the amounts of cars being driven/owned reduces we will come to plenty of advantages in manys ways. Human Health, abilities, and living spaces will all benefit from being car free !

Less cars makes the area less compacted which allows more space for side walks and walk ways to be built into the small town that have a high population. Places such as VAUBAN Germany and French and Swiss borders and many other places will have noo street parking, driveways and home garages. Without all of the car infested thing such as spoken there will be appropiate space and routes for public transportation and makes things and place s more accessible. Instaed of having a mall along side a distant highway it can have walk ways and more space for shopping centers and people to come not having to worry about having to find a space to park or any other conflict we all would run into reguarding personally owned vehicles. Not mentioning many more abilities that will come to hand when we become car free. Becomming car free environments is a very important task also for health reasons of everyone. Riding bikes, hiking, and walking will all come a part of everyones daily activity if not while being publically transported.. Smog is also a big issue hear, agreed? For example, in Paris, there smog percentage went down 60% because they are going through the process of limiting ownership of cars.

It is guarenteed that we will benefit from being car free. Less hassal, large decrease in accidents of vehicles and in health of all around. it is a big change but but an even larger advantage.
