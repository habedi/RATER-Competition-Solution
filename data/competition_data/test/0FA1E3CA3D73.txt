Is it right to force students into doing activities that may not fit their plans cleanly? In today's world, there are so many students with different problems and ideas that it will be hard to benefit all of them with any new big changes. Why I disagree with this decision of the extracurricular activity is because it will be more stressful for students, make students hate school more, and destroy student's freedom of choice.

Students have too much stress to fit in their schedule like homework, logistics, and family. Some may even have one extracurricular activity out of school that interferes with their schedule already. In fact, I have soccer, an extracurricular activity, every Thursday during Fall and Spring, after school. On those Thursdays, I had to first hope that I don't got heavy loads of homework from all of my school subjects. Then, I have to do the homework that I got quickly because if I don't finish by 5:00 p. m, it will consequently, make me stay up late at night due to that leftover homework.

Forcing students to do more things at school will only make them hate school more. Kids hates that they are in school in the first place. When we get as little social time as 25 minutes and learn things that are just unnecessary and useless for our lives, students will probably want to get out whatever they are in quickly. Just adding more things to hate about school will therefore, enrage students as it will be infringing on their free time that they have left.

This decision will undermine and help destroy the right of free choice and our wills. This will show that only the school rules the minds and wills of hundreds of students. We, the students, are already being control a lot by the school and our Board of Education just by what we learn, what we can and can't do, and how much free time we get. However, this decision, will be the ultimate nail in the coffin, the ultimate game changer, and the ultimate betrayal to our slowly dying freedoms.

Overall, I highly disagree with this decision because it will be more stressful to students, make us hate schools more, and will destroy our wills and rights. Also, for something that will add more stress to the individual, burden our already terrible relationship between student and school, and will make school feel more like a dictatorship, must not be simply install on a school. I shall ask the question once again, Is it right to interfere with what students can do regards to if they will have trouble accepting the change?
