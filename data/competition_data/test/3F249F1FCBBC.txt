Yes, I do agree with this decision, it is important that you are bringing yourself into the school more by doing at least one extracurricular activity. I think this is important because if you are a student at a school you should be engaged to that school in and outside of school hours. I mean one extracurricular activity is not that much to bear with, it could be really fun , you could play sports, you could do the yearbook, and you can even serve on the student council. If I were a principal at a school I would encourage this rule too because I would want kids to have fun in school not just learn and do things that are required. I would want to show the students that school is not something that you should dread, but it is something that you should take advantage of and use it everytime you can. I know that students just want to get back home right after school hours but they do not realize that they can stay after and have so much fun doing activities and bonding with other students that also are doing the activities with you. After school activities can be really fun, you can sign up for a once a year sports competition that our school does like the flag football tournament. The flag football tournament was so fun for every one of the students that signed up for it. Like I said it should not be something that you dread, it should be something that you want to do often. I know a lot of students are really upset about this new rule because they do not like doing things with other people that often, but once they start doing it and meeting students that you have never spoken to before everything starts to become fun and exciting.

Students are constantly on their phones and their games that they forget all about all the fun you could be having off phones and screens. Some students are in such a rush to finish school to go home back to their screens when they could be hanging out with their friends after school and before school. I think extracurricular activites are great opportunities to be bonding with new people and making friends. As an example, I did not have too many friends back in 7th grade but after I started going to after school activities such as weight lifting and other clubs, I have been doing a great job making friends and actually have a nice social life now. I am just saying this new rule that you have to do one extracurricular activity is going to help a lot of people that are struggling with making friends and talking to new people. After this year they are going to love our principal for deciding this for everyone. Students are going to be hanging out with their new friends that they met in after school activities and they are going to look back and wonder, what would have happened if this were never a rule. I just want kids that do not have many friends to meet new people and future friends for themselves.

I used to struggle making friends and talking to new people, but some of these extracurricular activites made me feel better about myself and less insecure. It was a lot of great experiences for me and I just want everyone that was in my position to feel the same way I do right now, that is why I am agreeing on this idea. I do not want any kids to suffer or be shy, I want them to meet new people and make friends during these extracurricular activities. I just agree with this so much because this is how you meet and bond with new people, I feel like a lot of students need one extracurricular activity. For example I know a student that is not that very social and is struggling to make new friends other than myself, I told him that he should go to some after school activities to meet other students and make new friends. The next day he went weight lifting with me and he met some new people and now he has more friends. I just want this opportunity to be taken advantage of by some students. This is why I agree with the idea of making students take at least one extracurricular activity.
