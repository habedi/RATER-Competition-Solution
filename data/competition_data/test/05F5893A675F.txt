Exploring another planet may be fun, but how would you like to live in a different planet? Venus is the second planet from the sun, but it's hard to study this mysterious planet because of the different risk that may be on the planet. Many people have tried to visit this planet but had no success. The reason of not accomplishing this goal is because of the many dangers that are within the planet. Although it may seem fun to go study another planet, some may consider it to be a major risk due to the fact that: It's a new planet with no knowlage of knowing what might happen, high or low tempretures, and challenges that may come to getting to know this planet.

Many scientist sent numerous spacecraft to Venus but unfortunetly none has maintaine to last the newly planet for more than a few hours. In the text it states, "Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.2). However, people may ask why vist this planet, we have other planets that are more closer. Well studies have shown that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the text it states, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.4). So, the only difference of the Earth, and Venus is the tempreture they have.

In any planet, you don't happen to know the tempretures in the planet. Many plantes have high or low tempretures, and some may even have toxic air for us humans. In Venus the air is mostly made up of carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfuric acid. In the text it states, "97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus" and "Clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in Venus's atmosphere"(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Wanting to go vistit another planet is meaning having to wear special gear so you dont get sick due to the different air it has from Earth. Furthermore, the text also states, "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Having high degrees is very dangerous for us humans, especially if we've never encountered this problem here on Earth.

Austrounots are very brave people, they do all these studies for us so we could understan how another planet functions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) do send humans (Austrounots) to go study Venus, but they don't particuarly land on the planet. In the text it states, "NASA's possible solution to the hostlie condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"(The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This motion is leting the humans hover over the planet and it helps protect the people from any harmful ground conditions by not touching the planets surface.

In conclusion, it is fun to study another planet, yes it may seem harmful but in reality the NASA people do know what they are doing and yes they will watch over you and protect you. They
