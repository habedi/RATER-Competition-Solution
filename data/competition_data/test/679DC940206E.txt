Some people say that offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes for home by way of online or video conferencing because student can learn every student have defferint profit to growth and school make good offer for their students to keep learning and fiend their goal, i thing students has that benefit to attend classes in home , and that's a good point to student's has good benefit to they can study online and they never stpo and they keep learning, learning, learning ... learning is never finish learning does't have end point.

If the students has that kind of benefit they cant growth higher, and they can have good result. some school makeb online learning ans they have video conferencing because some students have job they can't came to school full time of school and they make that benefit to all students be able to attend classes in home .

if studens be sovereign about their self at the end they can fiend high ranking in thair life. every person should learning because if we dont learn we can't fiend our goal's, and also if we don't study we can't have a good life in the future. we have alot of benefit's from home (family, parent) and school, we shuold use it and ask question and make ouer self smart and to be laborer person.

Other people say that the offer distance leaning as not an option for students to attend classes from home because students can learn better in school, they sould came to school and study hard and do their their work. and to be a nice person, heplful ,and hard worker to have a gread job and gread live in the future.
