The author uses supporting claims very well in his article. Stating how we could use machanical computers to put on venus that can withstand the 800 degrees fahrenheit. Where regular computers would not survive. Or the use of silicone, in the article it states that the silicone was able to withstand 3 weeks of venuses harsh eviorment. Or to use space crafts.

With these types of advancements this could help us learn more about venus. And how its features are very similar to earth. Which might have had water or even life forms at one point. Studying venus could help us discover new technology or materials. But it would come with challenges the idea of using a spacecraft to hover around venus orbit, could help us but the dense cloud cover would make it difficult to see.

This resherch could help us find new ways to explore space. Which could help us not be limited to what we can achive from going forward in space exploration. From new materials to information to why venus became what it is today. With this information maybe one day we could make it on venuses surface but only time will tell.
