Dear. principal

I think you should allow kids to bring there cell phones to school. Because if they need something they can just call up there mom/dad, and have them bring it to them during lunch. Instead of asking the teacher if he/she can leave the class and go all the way up to the office. And the teacher would probably say yes but he might also be mad because he was about to give a test or something. And I personally think it would be a lot easier to just ask the teacher to use your cell phone and call your mom/dad, to bring you something during your lunch period. It would be allot easier to just do that instead of having to walk all the way to the other side of the school to the office. And the teacher doesn't even no if you are going to the office for all he knows you could just be wandering around the school doing nothing you're suppose to be doing at all. So that's why I think you should allow kids to use cell phones during lunch and passing periods.

And most kids already use there cell phones to text each other during class and for a calculator if they need one so I would let them use there cell phones during lunc your friend: STUDENT_NAME
