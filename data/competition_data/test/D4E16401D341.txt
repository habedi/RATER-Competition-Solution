Some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue their learning over the summer. The question is should the students' projects be teacher- designed or student- designed? I believe summer projects should be teacher- designed. Teacher- designed projects are entirely beneficial than student- designed projects because students prepare themselves for college, it takes them less time to complete the project and help students develop many other skills needed in life.

First, students are able to prepare for college with a teacher- designed project, by helping them get used to a criteria that comes with a project. Often time in college students are given certain requirements needed to get a passing score. For example, a student may have to write a 10 page report in MLA format when they attend college if they are not used to completing strict projects, they may not complete the courses needed in college. That is why it is imperative if students start now than to be left behind later.

Second, summer projects should be straight to the point and shouldn't last an extended amount of time to complete.

If students hit the basic points and objectives of a project than they will learn more about the specific subject and they will excel passed the standard qualifications of the project. If there is less time wasted on guessing what the teacher would like to see, than that gives students more time to enjoy their summer.

Lastly, teacher- designed projects may help students excel in life. Teacher- designed projects are developed to encourage students in many different ways. For example, if the teacher assigns a report; that will help a student with word documents. Also, if a teacher assigns a speech as a project it will help students with their public speaking. Teachers help prepare students for their future and everything they will need in life.

In conclusion, teacher- designed projects help students in many ways possible. They will be able to experience a taste of college, take less time with their project and help students in the long run . Some may say that summer projects should be student- based to encourage their minds of creativity and uniqueness, however without the guidence from a teacher students may not understand the importance of structured classwork . Schools should allow summer projects to be teacher- designed to help students reach their full potential.
