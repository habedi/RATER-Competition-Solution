There are many things that people think the Face on mars is. You however, think that the face was created by aliens. We have gathered a lot of evidence on this and here is why you are wrong.

In paragraph 12 it says, "What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West." So if it really was an ancient alien artifact then that mean that aliens have been here as well. Along with all of the pictures we have aquired if there was a civilization we would have been able to see at least some of the remains in the pictures. But we have not.

Paragraph eight however, says, "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." Though this could be true, we have better quality pictures now than we did then and there are no alien markings shown. With the quality of the pictures we have now we can zoom in and it still looks fairly close to how it looks at normal size, and there are no markings.

In paragraph seven it tells us once more that, yet again, it is a natural landform. But people are not satisfied with that answer. In paragraph five conspiracy theorists say that it's bona fide, or evidence of life on Mars. They say that NASA would rather hide this information but people who work for NASA wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Would they seriously hide this kind of information from the public? No, because it would get them money and this would possibly be a world changing discovery.

So, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landmark. It has been proven that it is a landmark and nothing more several times. If you don't believe me then fine. But I really think you should just hang this one up for now.
