Do you smell that? Its the smell of gasoline and exaust fumes. Cars are taking over suburban areas. Spewing out polution and contaminating the air. There are solutions, and cities across the world are trying them.

One city that has impacted many is the city of Vauban in Germany, this city has car free streets. They were able to acomplish this by making stores and buisnesses walking distance. Apariently people are happier without cars, Heidrun Walter (citizen of Vauban) while she was walking the streets of Vauban said," When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way.". Furthermore having car free streets is also benificial to the fitness of the citizens. Without a car you are forced to walk or ride a bike which is a form of exercise.

Vehicles are terrible for cities. Cars spew exaust fumes that rise into the air and polute the cities. In Paris they almost hit record high polution levels. Cars were banned untill the polution level went down, smog covered the cities. The polution got trapped in the layers of the smog. The smpog levels rivaled Beijing, which is the most poluted city in the world. The only way to cut down on polution is to stop using cars, or switch to hybrids and plug in cars.

Some cities are taking it days at a time. In the city Bogata, Columbia there is a day where no one is alowed to drive. In Bogata they have this one day where no one is alowed to drive, they have this day to cut down polution levels and clear the streets. Other cities have started doing the same thing. This day is very benificial to the cities It helps decrease polution and smog levels and traffic jams. More people are riding bikes, going to parks and since more people are walking they have made broad, smooth sidewalks.

These movements are changing cities and making them healthier. Soon there will be less cars clean air and happier cities. So, are you ready to change.
