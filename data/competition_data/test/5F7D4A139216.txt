Alien life on Mars seems a little out of this world. If they haven't made contact with us by now what are they doing? Some of the alien hopefulls say that there are some major signs like the Face on Mars. Well it's not a sign of any sort, because of some reliable research. This resaerch includes increadible images of it from spacecraft and that its simialr to natural formations on Earth. These reasons are why the Face on Mars is just natural, not alien made.

First of all, the Face on Mars was first discovered when the Viking 1 spacecraft took pictures over the Cyndonia region of Mars in 1976. The pictures looked like an ancient Egytian face but after studying them a group at the Jet Propulsion Lab said that it was only a common mesa with shadows that played tricks on your eyes. Then again in 1998 and 2001 clearer photos of the face were taken. They showed that it was only a massive rock.

Secondly, it is been said to be a natural landform similar to those in the American West. The Face on Mars is just a butte which occurs when lava domes into an isolatd mesa. Scientist Jim Garvin says, "It remids me most of Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." So this "face" is almost like a natural landform right here on Earth acorrding to the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.

Although, these points are valid how can we tell what the Face on Mars really is untill we actually go there. For all we know the pictures are being obstructed by Martian clouds or that NASA is releasing false images. But, why would a space angency always in need of some more funding for even more research want to hurt itself by not releasing real images. Also why would NASA mess with the most clear, powerful, and detailed images of the Face that they have from not being right there hovering over the rock formation.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural rock formation with some cool shadows. There is full proof evidence that shows this to be true. There is the fact that its just like other formations in the area and on Earth and that there are some amazing pictures of it taken years apart that only get more and more detailed. Other claims do not have this kind of true scientific reaserch behind them.
