Dear Principle,

In my opinion I choose policy 2, against cell phones. policy 2 would best fit this school , I will tell you two reasons why.

The first reason is a lot of kids steal and lose there cell phones at school and sometimes they never get them back. so to lower the rate of people losing there cell phones we should not bring are cell phones to school period.

The second reason was is that the kids at school try to talk and text during class, that is why there phones always go off. So they should keep their phone off or just not bring it to school it causes to many distractions and we can not all afford to be held back because we were to busy paying attention to are phones.

I want every kid to make good grades but they cannot do that if they try to talk or text during class. I'm not saying don't ever have a cell phone all I'm saying is to keep them away from school grounds and if some kids try to think they are cool and have there cell phone at school then they should get a referral for not obeying school rules.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
