Cellphones are a part of everyone's day to day life. We find out information, contact others, even kill time using these tiny little computers. It sometimes seems like we couldn't survive without such an essential device, but in reality it may cause more harm than good especially if used in the wrong situations. The "National Safety Council" reports that there are more than 1.6 million crashes every year due to texting and driving. It has become one of the nations highest causes of death. Almost every state in America has banned it and in some eye's it should be enforced more than it is. The use of your cellphone while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed or even accepted in society.

While driving at the speed of 55mph if you close your eyes for even 5 seconds then you've already driven the distance of a football field. Now imagine that every time someone looks down at their phone to read or respond to a text for 5 seconds they have already endangered all the other people that were in that football field's length of road. Although it may seem very minor at first to just look down for a second, it is very dangerous. Even though in some situations it may seem like it's an emergency and you need to reply at that moment, it is always safer to pull over and deal with it then. Risking other people's lives is not something that should be taken lightly.

With how updated and modern our technology is now a day's, there should be absolutely no reason to text and drive. New technologies have given the ability to use your phone hands free and be able to text or call without ever looking away from the road. In Georgia there was a law implemented that requires every driver to have this hands free system set up in their car. This in return has caused many drivers to put the phone away and just use the vocal features. The hands free law has saved many people's lives but there are still many phone users behind the wheel.

To sum this up, texting and driving is very dangerous. Putting others lives at risk or even your own just to send that couple word text is not worth it. There are many ways of avoiding this problem, like simply pulling over, or using bluetooth and letting the information be told over the air. Many people would feel safer on the roads and maybe even take in some of their surroundings and be more alert. If this was taught to young teenagers before they got their driver's license then many of their crashes would have been avoided.
