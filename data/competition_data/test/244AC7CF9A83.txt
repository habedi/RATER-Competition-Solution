In 1976 a picture was taken by Viking 1 was taken that sparked up controversy. In the picture of the Martian surface there appears to be the shape of a face made from the rock. Although it was disproven that it was a face built by aliens it still makes some people subscribe to the consperocy theories surrounding this Martian Mesa.

Some of the claims hat support that this is a natural occurance and not a monument built by aliens is that when in different lighting it turns from a face to just a normal mesa. But, of course, some people don't believe this and they say that NASA is just trying to cover it up. In responce to these accusations NASA said that it would be amazing if it actually was an alien monument because it would give new light onto exploring the Red Planet.

In the text the author states that to achieve the photo that proved the face was not actually a face took extreme detail to get perfect and that if it was a face or their was any other buidling around the mesa it would be as clear as day. Also, even here on planet Earth there are examples of these mesa such as the one in Idaho that is a lava dome about the same height as the face. So, in conclusion, NASA really doesn't have a reason to cover it up; if it wasn't a face then they don't really loose anything but if it was a face then they would get tons of money for missions to Mars.
