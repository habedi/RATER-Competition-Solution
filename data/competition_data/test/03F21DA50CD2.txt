Have you ever heard of the story " A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves." I am going to try convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys cause the kid in this story named Luke joined and he liked it.

The first reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is you get to help out other countries by giving them food,water,and help them get shelter and it is a way to see more parts of the world.

My second reason is that you get to care for animals because you bring animal with you to give them to the people to cary stuff around them just making them cary all the stuff they need to cary by hand.

Third reason is that you can sight see like Luke did he got to see excavated castle in Crete is'nt that fun you get to see a castle I would like to see a castle would'nt you and you get to go to Eurpoe and China.

My conclusion is that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it's fun and advetures you get to see other parts of the world that you may not hav ever seen. Also may get to see the excavated castle like luke did and tis is all the reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
