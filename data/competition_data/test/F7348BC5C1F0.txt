I believe that policy 1 is a better policy for our school. It will allow kids to do their work, but also give them the privilege of talking with their friends. It will also make kids a lot happier while they are in the classroom. A lot of the students will be happier if they are allowed to have cell phones during school hours.

Most of the students play with their phones during class anyway. The policy will make the students more comfortable using their cell phones during class. It will also make the kids do their work because they know that if they get their work done, they can talk to their friends. If you let us have our phones during school, most kids will get better grades.

Most of the students don't get the chance to talk to their friends during lunch. Cell phones give the opportunity to do that. It will also allow students to meet other students by texting. It's not like the cell phones will be loud, we can turn the volume down on our phone.

If you have happy kids in the classroom, you know that there isn't going to be that much to worry about. Most kids hate coming to school, but if you allow them to use their cell phones during school, they will do a lot better. I have friends that have a phone, but they can't use it that often because of all the rules at school.

Even though they may be distracting to you, but they are not that distracting to us. Most of the students will be happy if they are allowed to use cell phones in class. Some kids don't like to talk to people to their face, but they will be able to associate with students better. You think it will get in the way of our work, but it won't, it will be the opposite.
