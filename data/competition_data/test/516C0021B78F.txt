Dear Principal of middle school and high schools,

I am a fellow 8th grader, and i know for a fact, that... teenagers love their phones. Why take them away when the could actually need them at some point?

I think it is fair for them to use them during lunch and other free times, but they should be turned off during class time. I think Policy 1 you should consider.

Yes, it would be rather irritating having their phones on during class and trying to text message their friends, so you take them away?

I think you should just say if you are caught with a phone, to call your parents and have them come and take the cell phone.

Another reason that I believe that if their parents need to call them for an emergency, like if one of them got in a car crash or someone got sick, or had to go to the hospital, then they should have their cell phone. If their parents really need them though, they can just call the school, right? Not their child because they know they are most likely in class.

Some parents do not acknowledge that their kid is in class, and not to disrupt them.

So therefore, I think the teenagers should be able to check or use their cell phone in lunch or in free times.

In case they have an emergency or parents called them for an emergency. That's the only reason I think that they should use their cell phone.

Should the students text during class though?

Is it a NEED? For some students, it acts like a need.

Some kids just get out their phone during class and try to secretly text or look at their phone.

Most teachers have caught on when they see this kind of thing.

What students want to text each other during class?

That's right, most teenagers.

Texting during class should be a rule at school, to NOT text. It is rude and your not paying attention to the teacher and you may possibly start to do worse with your grades and school work. That's why I believe that Policy 1 you should consider because it will allow students to have their phones in school, but to turn them off during class.

You are allowed to use them during lunch and free times.

I believe that Policy 1 is a better cell phone policy.

The students will better enjoy school.

You may have to really enforce that they can't use their phones during class, because some students will sneak them.

So the teachers should really watch their students, when their looking down for no reason, and smiling.

Most likely they have their cell phone. Then some students just obey, and don't use their phone during class.

They may use them during lunch, and other free periods, or times.

Policy 1 is better for the school and the students sake.

Sincerely, An 8th grader fro
