The Facial Action Coding System is a very valuble computer software that I think could help save the lives of many students who are suffering from depression and thoughts of suicide and also students who are struggling with school and here is why. According to Dr. Huang, "even though individuals often show varying degrees "( like not smiling as broadly). Also according to the article, " Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the difference units, the software can identify mixed emotions ( as in da Vinci's masterpiece)." The article also states " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." And that's how I think the Facial Action Coding System is a very valuble software that could many students suffering from depression and thoughts of suicide and also those who are struggling with school.
