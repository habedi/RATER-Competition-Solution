Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughout the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.

Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.

Almost all teachers a faculty spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.

A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.

If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. If assignments must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power point on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during the upcoming school year

Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them. This is why students should be able to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a desire to do the work.
