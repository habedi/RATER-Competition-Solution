Do you think students should be required to participate in a school activity?

Well your principal decided that all students has to at least participate in one school activity.

The principal wants every student to participate in at least one school activity, I disagree with that because students want to spend time home or with their friends and spend some time doing what they like to do.

I think that they shouldn't have to do a school activity,only if they want to because maybe they want to spend time with their family and friends.

First,some students like to go to the mall with their friends and spend time together. Because maybe the school they go to dont have the activities that they like,and they just want to be with their friends.

Second,they want to hangout with their friends but, also join a different activity that their school doesnt have with their friends.

Because,then they can spend time together and have fun when doing the stuff they like to do.

third,maybe the teachers dont let students talk to one another in the activities class and they like to do fun activities but its boring because, they can't enjoy as much because they can't talk to their friends.

Maybe,they do like activity but like actives outside of school so they can talk to their friends and enjoy it better then in school. And also to create bonds with their friends and to know them better then before.

Students like to spend time with their friends and enjoy actives outside of school better then the ones in school.

Also,students maybe do like the activities in school but, they want to spend more time at their house then at school.

First,some students might like to play video games because,that's what they like to do.

And because they can't play in school because you have to learn and want to have fun.

Second,they want to rest from a long day at school.

Because can be hard for some student and maybe activities will make them even more tired and they just want go home and get some rest.

Third, some students like to spend time with their family and get to know them even more. Also,when their at home they can also create bonds with them.

Because maybe they don't spend a lot of time with them and if they do maybe they will get along more.

students disagree with having to do a school activity because they want to spend time at home and with their family.

Students disagree with having to do a school activity because they want to spend time with family,and friends.

Also students might want to do other stuff like play sports,practice for their test,do their homework,or even to just sleep,everyone likes to something different and maybe some student might even like school activities. But, I still disagree because I feel like there are more people that don't like school activities.
