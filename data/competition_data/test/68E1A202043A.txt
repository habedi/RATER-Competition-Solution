No Phones While Driving

Smartphones, The devices of the future. With Phones you can: call people, watch movies, FaceTime, and much more. They have had a big impact on society and how we communicate. The main focus on phones was to make contact with people over large distances. However, people are now using phones While their driving and that can create complications.

Calling or texting while on driving has become more of an issue since more are acquiring phones. The more phones come out the cheaper old ones are. That means more people are able to afford them which means a higher chance of a car crash (assuming they own a car).Some people own a car that has a bluetooth speaker that they can use to talk without having to put their hands on the phone. Of course this doesn't mean that a car crash is cant happen.

Cars with a built-in speaker should make driving easier but talking can still take focus away from the road. The road is one of the most important things for a driver (I'm not able to drive but I received help).Taking your eyes off it could very well end in the injury or death of several people.

Did you know that nearly 1.25 million people die from car crashes in a year? That means we lose more than 3287 people per day.

There aren't any laws that say that driving with a phone is illegal but getting into a crash can get many killed and it is also treated as a murder. Meaning that phones while driving should be a crime in some states. It might seem petty to want to ban cell phones but the fact that so many deaths happen so often proves that this issue needs to be resolved. It would be hard to catch people on their phones while driving but with some type of technology it should be possible. With the current rates at which people die due to accident i believe that making a change should be a top priority.

In conclusion, Phones might be great and help out a lot but they can be the things that put you in your grave. This is a subject that could be completely overlooked but it's important to find a way to minimize all accidents and death. All life is important and trying to protect it should be a top goal for all of humanity.
