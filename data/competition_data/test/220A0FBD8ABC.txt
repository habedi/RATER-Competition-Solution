In the story of ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨ Venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, It´s also the second planet from our sun. From earth people can see Venus from a safe distance. The Earth has a planet that is closer to it and it´s called Venus. Earth and Veus are often referred as twins. Venus has blanets of thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide. The more challengeinng about Venus´s atmosphere is that it has highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Venus has a average temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it´s pressure is 90 times greater in the atospheric. Venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian additional impediments weather like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. If Venus is so inhospitable, why the scientists are discussing further visit to the surface. Astronomers thinks that Venus was probably covered with largely oceans and could have supported various forms of life ,just like Earth. Venus surface has rocky sediment and familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus surface at thirty-plus miles, its temperature would be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit. but its air pressure would be close to match the Earth´s sea level. The Earth´s solor power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed on its level. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, form a distance. Therefore, scientists are seeking to start a conduct mission to understand Venus. By the system comparison that used machanical part can be made more likey resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.
