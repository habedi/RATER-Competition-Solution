Have you ever thought what a student's emotions are accordding to their facial expression? Apparently, a computer can using FACS ( Facial Action Coding System ). But, some wonder; how is it useful using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom valuable?

A computer software that can recognize someone's reaction( the FACS ) has been used on Leonardo Da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System), has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The software uses all 44 major muscles to move human-like muscles in the computer. From there it calculates the percentage of the the person's emotions.

Now will this technoloy be valuable? I, myself, honestly don't see a use of Facial Action Coding System in a classroom, but instead in a nurse or counsiler, or even a school therapist. Some adults need to know a student's emotions for help. A student could be down, but doesn't want to show it or talk about. That's were the FACS comes in to detect the student's emotion and probably saving a student's life. The machine and therapist can also be able to diagnose students with depression, bipolar disorders, etc.

In conclusion, there is value in using this technology, the Facial Action Coding System, to read students' emotional expressions. Afterall, the machines are saving lifes.
