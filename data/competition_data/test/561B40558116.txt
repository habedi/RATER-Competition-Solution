I agree with the statement saying that we should use this technology of emotional expressions because it could help people with knowing what is gong on with the person's personal life. Even though kids would not like it it should be brought to use because there can't be anymore drepression into kids life.

First reason why I think we should use technology like this is because it says that, "even though individuals often shwo varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly." This means that if we start using this type of technology we can figure out if a person is good or bad. Another reason why we should use this technology is because it says, "Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait taht conveys happy, worried, etc." This could mean that even if you might know what they feel you could most possilbe be wrong because if they look happy that does not mean they are actually happy they could be sad in the inside of their body. Then finally my last reason is they used the Mona Lisa smile as a demonstration. Then it said, "The Mona Lisa demonstartion is really intended to bring a smile to your face... Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad." This means this technology can detect if you are actually happy or sad.

In conclusion, I agree with this kind of technology because it can help people understanding other people's feelings. It could also demonstration how fast time is going by technology. Also, what technology can do nowadays.
