Dear Principal,

I believe that policy two is better than policy one. You should consider allowing students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times. I believe that this policy is better because it wouldn't be allowed during class time. Also, because the students aren't learning during that time and there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to use them. I think that we should allow them during lunch time also because if a student forgot something for class they can text instead of calling. Also, if they need to give there parent's a reminder of something or they changed their plans for after school time. I believe that they should use them and they would be turned off during class time. I also think that people with cell phones would think it would be better cause they can be free to text whoever at free periods so they wouldn't have to do it during class. I believe that you should to policy two.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
