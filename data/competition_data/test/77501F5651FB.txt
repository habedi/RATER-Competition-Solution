My friend Brynna thinks that the "Unmasking the Face on Mars." was done by aliens, but the other hand I dont think it was. The first photos looks like an alien but they were taken long long ago, but the pictures today are way sharper and shows us more detail about them. On paragraph 7 it states, "And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 7). Basically it was just a landform that looks like a face.

Also the artical states that the weird looking mask looks like landforms common around the American West, it states on paragraph 12, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American west"(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 12).

Brynna states from paragraph 5," Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA

would rather hide, say conspiracy theorist"(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 5).

But you have to think about the citizens, would you really want to know if aliens do exist or not? Not knowing is stress free and just makes the world a better place. But if you know you'd freak out every day of your life thinking aliens can come down any day now. Not knowing everything is a good thing sometimes and not knowing what NASA is hiding is a good example.

So knowing that the pictures they have are real pictures, it is a landform. My text evidence in my first three paragraphs will give you the reasons why "Unmasking the Face on Mars" is a landform and not a face.
