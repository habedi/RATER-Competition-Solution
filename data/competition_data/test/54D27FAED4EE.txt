In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

In the article, the author state that Venus has dangerous conditions for human life to explore. "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." Even though Venus has harsh conditions, there are still interesting facts about the planet that astronomers want to look more into. "Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may as well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."

In Paragraph 7 the author explains how sceintist are trying to make other approaches to studying Venus. "Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." Even though Venus is dangerous, this pushes scientist to innovate more to make their exploration successful and it will be effective on other planet explorations.
