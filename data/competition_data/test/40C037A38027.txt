In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", the author talks about a new type of technology that can detect human emotions. This new technology is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS for short. The scientists who created this new technology believe it would be very useful if integrated into different aspects of peoples lives. Ones of their most prominent suggestions being in classroom computers.

Using the new technology of FACS in schools would be very useful. It could sense when a student is having a difficult time with an assignment, or is confused about the lesson being taught. This way it could change the teaching method to one the student understands more. Then it would use that method more often, and the student would be able to learn more. " "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." ". It could also sense when the student isn't quite interested in the lesson. So the FACS technology could change it to one that captivates the students attention more.

In sum, using this new technology that can detect emotions in the classroom would be very useful. It would be able to modify a students learning method based on their productivity. This would allow then to understand what they are being taught better.
