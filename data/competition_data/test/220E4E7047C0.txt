I think that we should have driverless cars. There are multiple reasons that I believe this, like fewer accidents and safety reasons.

For one thing, like stated above, there would most likely be fewer accidents. So far, according to paragraph 2 "their cars have driven more than half a million miles without an accident." Though the cars are not "truly driverless," the fact remain that even though they still need human drivers to navigate through certain spots, and still haven't crashed, they are pretty impressive. The driver would also be able to take over the vehicle, if needed, to get through road construction, and getting around accidents. If the driving technology were to malfunction, the driver would simply take over the driving until they can get to a safe spot to pull over or call for help. It is a great safety feature.

Speaking of safety features, these autonomous cars have many of them. The notify the driver when they need to take over. According to paragraph 7 GM has "developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object." Google car "announces when the driver should be prepared to take over." Others consider flashing likghts and other heads-up displays. There is also the possibility of less pollution.

The cars that Sergey Brin forsees "would use half the fuel of today's taxis." With pollution being a major problem around the world, especially in places that are high in the industry business, we could use cars like that. Eventually that kind of fuel saving would go into other cars. These fuel saving cars could be the first step toward a greener world.

Overall, I think that autonomous cars are a fantastic idea because of the likelyhood of fewer accidents and the numerous safety features that the cars offer along with enviromental protection.
