I'm against driverless cars because i feel like that letting a drone take over your car and drive for you is dangerous. This idea is not good because it would cost a lot of money to produce and not a lot of people would buy the cars since they are so expensive so therefore they wont be making much profit from it.

It's dangerous in someways because if you just let the robot do the drivng then it would propbably take you to another destination. If it stoped working for some odd reason then the person who isn't driving could be in serious danger because if they are not paying any attention to the road then they could get in an accident and get seriously hurt' and who would be responsible for the accident you may ask? The robot becuase they are supposed to be driving you and making it safe for you while you can do something else, The company who built the car would get sued because they say that its supposed to be safe, but being safe on the road is just you paying attention to the road not lettig some robot do it for you.

Sticking to drivng yourself is much better and cheaper becuase you won't have to spend so much money ona car that does that for you. Imagine having this technology in a super car now that would be really dangerous and stupid because the drone could fully take over of the car and start speeding, and supercars are meant for those type of things, but not on a public road you would be putting evryones lifes in danger. My conclusion is that driverless cars are not great idea, maybe for the greater future but for now not really.
