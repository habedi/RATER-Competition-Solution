Summer break is a three-month-long interruption for students from learning. Due to the lack of active educational engagement for most students during this break, many forget much of the material they learned. Therefore, schools are making use of summer projects to ensure students continuously learn throughout the year without any interruptions. Critics of the idea, mainly students, argue summer projects encroach upon the only necesary long term break students have from the ardous process of learning, and they believe that summer projects should be student-designed to further satisfy their demands. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed to assure students continue learning over break because teachers know the material better, teachers have more experience, and because students have an inherent bias.

Because teachers are very well-versed in their subjects, teacher-designed summer projects are more effective than their student-designed couterparts. For instance, compare a student-designed chemistry summer project to a chemistry teacher-designed summer project. The student's knowlege of chemistry is most likely miniscule when compared to that of the chemistry teacher's as the chemistry teacher would have years of experience in the feild as well as a college degree in chemistry. Therefore, the teacher-designed chemistry summer project will better ensure a more accurate understanding of greater range of chemistry than the student-designed counterpart. Since this same logic applies to many other educational subjects as well, teacher-designed summer projects will better achieve the goal of summer projects by assuring students continue learning during break.

Since teachers have more experience with creating projects and teaching their respective subject, teacher-designed summer projects are more proven to be effective. Teacher's experience (years of teaching) serves as a

"R and D" (research and design) period where teachers can learn which teacher-based projects will allow for the greatest chances of student success and understanding. For example, a teacher who found that poster summer-projects almost always guarantee higher diagnostic test scores than powerpoint projects will design poster summer-projects for his or her students in the future. Therefore, the additional experience that teachers have over students in designed projects and assignments is a major reason why teacher-designed summer projects should be utilized.

Student-designed summer-projects are prone to an inherent bias because most students are critics of the idea of using summer projects. These students believe that summer projects violate the idea of having a "break" from school and learning. As a result, students, with such mentalties, are most likely to design weak and non-effective summer projects when compared to those designed by teachers. These weak student-designed summer projects act as a "waste of time" rather than a valuable extension of learning from the classroom to over break. Therefore, it is more effective to utilize teacher-designed summer projects than these weak student-designed summer projects.

Due to teachers having more experience in their respective subject and teaching and students possesing an inherent bias, teacher-designed summer projects should be favored over student-designed summer projects. Teacher designed summer projects allow for a greater understanding of the subject by students in the most efficient manner; whereas, student-designed summer projects don't guarantee to produce any meaningful results. Therefore, the schools that require students to complete summer projects during their break should utilize teacher-designed summer projects to assure students continue learning during their break.Â
