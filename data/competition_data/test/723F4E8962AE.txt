I was in the Seagoing Cowboy program and you guys should to. I experianced adventures and many unique places, but it is more then just adventures it opened up the world to me and it could to the same for you. While we were on the boat we played volleyball, boxing, whittling, table tennis, fencing, baseball, and we also did some reading to help pass the time. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean and a month to get to China. It seems long but you have a lot of activities you can do. like on our way I cared for the animals to keep me busy. Before I joined this program I worked a two part-time job and did not know where my life was going to take me until my friends asked me to go on this amazing adventure. After that I just fellt so opened up. Thats why I think you should come to the Seagoing Cowboy program it would be fun and fun and fun and you would have the time of your life and it could open up the world to you and remember it is more then just activities and adventures! i know i had fun so you probably will to!
