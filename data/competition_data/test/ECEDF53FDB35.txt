Do you ever feel happy, sad or angry, or sometimes you don't even know what you are feeling? well now you can there is a new software, the Facial Action Coding System can tell you what you are feeling even when you dont know what you are feeling.

Fisrt it starts off when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; yes it is like the that one movie we've all seen Joy. Even the smallest smile you give can indecate how you are feeling. For example when you smile people think are happy; when you fake smile people stillthink you are happy even though you might either be happy, sad, or mad. Or some people don't even have a smile and people think that they are mad even though they could be happy, some people just don't like showing it.

There are many reason why people may not like showing how they really feel, some people don't like showing it because they may think they look weak. It is fine showing your emotions. Maybe they can let people know how they are feeling and it will get a lot better to let everything out, some kids don't like telling their parents how they feel, so maybe they can talk to a teacher who they actually trust. Some kids think no one understand them that is why some kids end up killing themselves.

These are reason why technology should be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.
