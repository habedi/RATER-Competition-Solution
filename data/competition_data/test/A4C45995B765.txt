In my own opinion I think driverless cars is a good and more effective idea than how we drive today. Driverless cars will make roads more safe for the driver, pedestrians, and other drivers on the road. Driverless cars is re-inventing how we've been driving for decades. The cars will use less gass and be more economy safe and they meet more people's needs unlike any bus or taxi ever could.

Study shows that a driverless car is less hazardous than any human driving. With a driverless car you don't have to worry about human mistakes, such as, someone picking up the phone and takings their eyes off the road; or someone putting on making up, brushing/combing their hair, or even eating while only keeping one hand attended to the wheel. A driverless car will alert the driver when there is danger ahead and will even come to a complete stop if necessary. Driverless cars won't run red lights, go over the speed limit, or even get out of control as a drunk driver would. Driverless cars is one of the many invention leading into the new world.

Cars that you won't have to drive is a good idea. I think they should be allowed in more states as long as they've been tested and proven to be safe. Driverless cars are hazardous free and economically beneficial, they would fundamentally change the world.
