Have you ever looked at a friend and they thought there was someething wrong wgen there was nothing wrong. Well I think this technology can be very valuable because it can give the percent of how people are,find what they feel even if they look differnet, and it will give you steps to help.

First it give the percent on people and all they feel. They just have to do the math and look at all the muscles in there body. Then they will put it in the six different feelings. Then add it all up and which every one is the highest is what that person is feeling.

Second it will make sure we are not thinking wrong about someone who looks like thet are feeling something when really its something else. It will give you an ad for how you are feeling and mak you watch it,but if you start to feel something else then it will give you a different ad to watch. It will give you a lesson how what you are feeling so you wont get board.

Last reason is it will give you steps to help you. step one it might tell you to lift the corners of your mouth. Second it will tell you to crow's-feel around your eyes. It will know if you are lieing and it will wait till you are telling the truth about it. It knows how important feelings can be so it wants the right one.

That is why I think that this technology is very valuable and will be helpful later in life. It might help people start staying out of fights and getting in trouble.
