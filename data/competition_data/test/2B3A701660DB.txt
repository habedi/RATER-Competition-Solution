Venus needs to be explored to scientists because, they are fascinated by Venus, long ago it was probably covered in big oceans, and thriving life. The planet has valleys, mountains, and craters as the text states... these are all physical features compelling that Venus was once thriving. Venus is facscinating due to the nature of its build... It has many physical features that earth has!

Scientists will one day make it to Venus, they are very focused on it, what could Venus bring back to earth, what could Venus do for life, and what was Venus like? These are all scientific questions that scientists vow to discover. They are making it scientifically productive as the text states, "Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth" this means that Venus was holding life, in the text is says "The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and productive?" so this shows that scientists are very well trying there best, and devoting hours into figuring out venus. Although many space shuttles without humans have landed on Venus, they have all burned within 2 hours, and been completely abolished! Venus can bring us many things to history along with knowledge... if there was life there, how did they live, how did they thrive, what caused Venus to not continue thriving? These questions will all be answered one day. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus as stated in the text... NASA is testing differnet conditions doing simulations, there are more fields of technology they are looking back at! Devices that were first envisioned in the 1800s, and they played a role in the 1940s.

In conclusion, striving to meet Venus has its values, not only the insights, but human curiosity will lead them into intimidating endeavors. Travel on earth and beyon should not be limited by dangers or doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination along with innovation as the text states.
