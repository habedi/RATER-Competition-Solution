When you go out in the streets have you ever seen a driverless car? Are you safe with letting your children in the streets knowing there is a car with no need of a driver to drive it? well , i dont argue with driverless cars. Why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver?

One of the reasons for not agreeing with the driverless car is safety. Safety is a big part the world and specially in the streets. There really is no need for driverless cars because in the paragragh it says " In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless " The human driver must remain alert an be ready to take over when the situation requires. If its a driverless car we dont need to pay attention because it would be driving on it own. Yet, the car still needs our help in situations it can't do it self.

Also, it says in the paragraph " Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert driver." So, when driving a driverless car you dont have to steer, accelerate, and brake. But you have to still pay attention. Driverless cars should not be allowed in the streets, An malfunction can happen at any second on the road an whos to blame? The driver or the driverless car? "The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge," admits Dr. Werner HUber, a BMW project manager driver. Theres always gonna be a challenge but we dont need more of a challenge when something isnt working in our driverless car.

Lastly, Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Which mean driverless cars are not safe, i mean not all cars are safe but really think about it , would you want you child out in the streets knowing the law is letting driverless car drive around? Because i know my children wouldnt be out. As a result , in most states it is illegal even to tesr computer driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?

My conclusion is that driverless cars should not be allowed on the streets because of safety reasons , and failures on streets. Nobody knows when, where, and at what time an accident can happen due to driverless cars. All cars always needs to be driven by a human not a computer. Laws are made for human drivers not computers.
