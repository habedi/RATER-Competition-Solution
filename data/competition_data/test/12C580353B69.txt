Dear Principal,

I know the idea of letting students have their cell phones out in school is an irritating process. When a students cell phone rings in class, it can interrupt the class and it can distract the student and everyone around them. I believe that as long as students get to class in time after lunch, they should be able to use their phones.

The truth is that lunch can sometimes get boring. Most of the times, the student might not have any friends to talk to while they're downstairs. If most schools use what we use here at SCHOOL_NAME, which is detention, mostly known as "the bench" most students would have friends that don't do their homework or might of done something to get them on the bench. Don't you think it would be unfair for a student to be all alone in lunch not having anything to do? Lunch is supposed to be a free time where we can have fun, instead of being bored in class like it shows in the video, but right now it feels like its just another class period. Students don't get to use their phones, and they're being supervised.

As long as phones are being turned off by the time they're in class, students should be able to use them. Although a student might have a class after lunch, snack or any other free period, using a phone can let them concentrate more. It lets them concentrate more in the perspective that a student might want to use their phone badly during class. Instead of taking the phone out and using it in a sneaky way, like it shows in the video, they can just take it out in their free time and pay more attention during class. Not giving a student the ability to use their phones, might increase the chance of a students grade getting lower, or them getting their phones taken away. I'm sure any principal would prefer to get their students grade to be high and to be enthusiastic about going to school. Also as you can see in the video, some students would just stay outside of school, which makes them be late, just to talk on the phone. When staying out is not an option, they might also just stay in their locker and miss some time in the class just to be on the phone.

Giving something new a try, can help you see if it would succeed or if it just simply has to be taken away. Trying using the phones during lunch and other free periods at least for a month, can make you see if its worth it or if its just not possible. If it shows a lot of distraction in getting back to class or on point then you can take it away permanently or for a few days.

Sincerely, your student.
