Dear principle students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school when we have free time and we accept your condition to turn it off during class time. After all us student work so hard, so you could at least give us a chance to let us use are cell phones when we have free time. Just imagine , that the students are now going to barely talk in lunch and its going to be a peaceful lunch for you and not just for you but for the staff and teachers. I know how loud us students are. Also I bet if you tell the students that your going to let us use are cell phones when we have free time, they'll agree to the terms that you recommended and besides if some students disobey you could take out the privileges off bringing their cell phones to school. so principle just think if you let us bring are cell phones the students would agree with all the terms that you give.
