Dear principle,

Being able to use our cell phones in lunch and when we have free time in classes is an excellent idea. The students would have a brake from learning and do something that they want to do. Letting us have use of our cell phones in school would be a privilege that I am sure no one would be upset about.

I believe that the first policy would be the best policy because it would give the students at the school more freedom. We would be able to text our friends without worrying that they would be taken away. When having our cell phones out, it would make tons of kids happy and would make the school much more exciting.

When our cell phones are off during the times when we are learning and trying to get an education is also important. Turning them off during this means that no one can get distracted, confused, and we can stay focused when the teacher has or is explaining something. We can also listen to what is going on in class.

When having our cell phones off when we are working makes it more exciting when we have free time and can take it right out of our backpacks or pockets and text our friend to see what is going on with them and just talk.
