Dear Principal:

Word on the street is that you're considering banning cell phones from school campus. Now, you know as well as I do that the students are NOT happy about this at all. But I'm sure that that alone is not enough to convince you to let our cell phones be. That's why I'm writing to you about a policy that will allow cell phones on school ground, with a few limits, that will satisfy everyone.

First off, let me tell you why banning cell phones altogether is a bad idea. The students will be infuriated if that idea is put into motion, and will not only defy the rule, but a handful of students might actually do worse things, such as texting in class. You see, if you take away something from the students, they'll not only continue bringing that said something, they will, just to show that they don't care what the school administration does, do worse things. It's just the way students my age are, and I'm sure the younger grades are just the same way.

Plus, a lot of us actually need cell phones; many students are part of after-school programs or clubs, and they need to call their parents to gain permission to stay. In fact, a lot of students know when and when not to use their phones, and go along with it. It's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule of using cellular devices during class. The rest of us know the rules and why it exists and respect that. The rest of us want to learn, and do learn.

Now, I propose an alternative to the "no phone" policy you are considering: let us keep our phones, but don't let us use them in inappropriate times, like in class. Let us continue bringing cell phones to school on the condition that we don't use them unless needed. I'm sure that we will be mature about this and honor your decision if you choose this rule. I promise you that if there are students that can't be grateful for the merciful decision you made, those will be minimal and can be dealt easily with ninth hour or lunch detention.

In conclusion, I thank you for your time in reading this letter, and I'm sure you'll choose the better option. Remember, it's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule.

Thanks for reading,
