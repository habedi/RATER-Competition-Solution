Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Should students be allowed to participate in certain sports with at least a grade B average?

My opinion I think it should be mandatory that all students should be made to have at least a B average or higher. I say that because school is much important than sports. Yes, I agree that certain sports will give you free scholarship to college but, you should at least have some education. School is all over the world: Math, Language, History, and Science.

Math because when you go to a store and you got to buy something; you need to know what amount of change you should get back. You need to know if your getting the a good deal or not? The basic adding, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Language because the way you talk to people. Using the correct gramercy when your writing on an application for a job. That is very important when your applying for a job so you can get paid so you can buy your own food and pay for your house.

History to know background to where your at and what your doing. Science by knowing what is in the ing of your food to see if you would die or not. Also to know what the stuff your using in your everyday job is just to know hoe to use to.
