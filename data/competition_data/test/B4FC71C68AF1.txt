Dear Principal,

I believe that for the safety and convenience of the student body, Policy 1 is the ideal choice for our school.

Sometimes students are forgetful and we leave important items at home in the morning. We ask to call our parents but many teachers do not allow us to use their phone because it will take time out of our educational period. If Policy 1 is ratified, then the students would be able to call or text their parents during their off periods. By this, no class time would be taken away and we would receive the items we are in need of.

A students cell phone could be extremely useful in an emergency where the teacher is not around or if the teacher were to pass out or be very badly injured . While someone runs to find an adult, the other could dial an emergency number so that help can arrive to the school as soon as possible. In a case like this, a students cell phone could potentially be a life saver.

If a student were to get sick and had to be sent home, the nurse would most likely call their parents. If the child's guardian refuses to answer the phone because its an unknown number, the student could use his/her phone to help the school nurse get in contact with their parent.

For these reasons, cell phones should be allowed at school according to Policy 1. Our cellular devises could make the school day much easier for everyone, including the student body, faulculty and guardians of the students.
