NASA has been wanting to explore our sister planet, but doesn't know how to make a vehicle capable of surviving Venus's atmoshperic differences from Earth. The author explains his claim of how it's a worthy pursuit that needs time and focus to happen. They strengthen their claim by describing the climate and dangers, differences in technology made to suvive it's conditions, and alternatives to exploring Venus.

The author of the passage first describes Venus. They describe how it's different from Earth and how that provides a challenge to NASA. The author brings in the atmospheric differences (such as what it's made of and the pressure), temperatures, geological, and weather differences. NASA has to take all of these into mind and adapt to it so they can explore the planet safely.

Since Venus is so different from Earth, NASA has to make vehicles that'll withstand the atmosphere and pressure of it. The author describes how they've come up with a blimp-like vehicle to explaore Venus safely for up to three weeks. The author explains how that could be a problem as well, seeing as how the blimp couldn't reach the ground to collect anything for NASA to study when they get back.

The author understands that NASA is working on alternatives to get closer to the surface of Venus so they can study it more. The author tells us how they've come up with different technological methods to get closer to the surface without damaging a vehicle or expensive equipment. They bring up a piece of electronic equipment made of silicon carbide that lasted for up to three weeks in the conditions of Venus. That detail gives us insight on how close NASA is to safel exploring the suface of the sister planet.

Exploring the surface of Venus has become a big focus for NASA. The author wants to give us insight of how challenging and dangerous it is, but also how they're working on making it possible with different pieces of equipment that's stable eough for the atmosphere of Venus. They do that by describing the climate and dangers of Venus, the differences needed to be made in technology to survive the conditions, and the alternatives that can be used to explore the surface of Venus safely.
