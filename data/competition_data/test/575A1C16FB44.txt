When you want to do something new ,you go for it. That is what Luke did ,right. The Seagoing cowboy is when you or someone else that helps take care of the animals on a boat , while they are crossing oceans. That is kind of like joining the milatary or the army. You are basically risking your life for other people, some peope you probably don't even know. It can be a lifetime experience.

It also can be a huge opprtunity. Like Luke couldn't say no to for trying something new after he was done with school. He was also at a young age. Starting early. After you are done with trying something new, you will realise that you have done something wonderful.

While you are working , you also realise that you are having fun while doing it. You could be working hard and having fun at the same time . Some people think ,if you do something that can take your life, isn't fun. I'm just saying if you like to do something then work hard to acomplish it.

And I'm not just saying that you have to do that ,but once you do it, you could have fun by doing it. Just like Luke did. Before finishing school , you should make plans for what you want to do. Dont wait to the last minute to think. Making differences is a good thing, not a bad thing. It seemed like Luke didn't know what Seagoing was, but it was something new so he went on and did it.

Seagoing can also give you a opprtunity to have fun with animals , if you like them. Luke grew up in farms, so I guess he liked them. He was prepared to work that job. I wouldn't want to do that, because I'm not a big fan about animals. But you like animals, you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or Cowgirl.
