Dear Principal,

I think that you should not allow phones to be used at all in school.

If you allow phones to be used at certain times in school students will soon get to comfortable with the idea and want to use them all the time. If you allow students to use phones in lunch there could be sexing or cyber bulling going on in your school.

Many phones will be lost and stolen if this is allowed.

This idea of have phones allowed to be used at certain times in the day is not a good idea at all and should never be put through.

Policy two is the way to go.

If phones are allowed in lunch and free periods kids will get comfortable with the idea of having phones on them at all times.

If students have their phones out for lunch they may keep them on and with them for the rest of the day. You get so used to having that little square in your pocket you might forget to take it out and put it in your locker after lunch.

This can lead to phones going off during class and distraction from class because students are texting under the tables.

Phones are useful and can be good but they can also be used for bad.

In school if this is allowed the number of cyber bulling and sexing will go up trumendouly.

There are all sorts of problems and fights that go on in school but if you give them a loaded gun they will only use it for bad.

There would be many more detention and guidance visits from the students if this is allowed.

This will make your staff stress out and angry.

Children these days are clumsy and forgetful. If you let them take there phones out of their pockets every minute to answer a text they will most likely lose it somewhere.

If someone have that brand new cool phone there will be people who will steal it.

That will cause fights and just many more problems.

This will lead to more fights and a lost and found full of phones.

This idea is just not good for anyone.

It will cause distractions and poor grades.

It will cause more sexing, cyber bulling, and will lead to stressed out angry staff members.

This proposition will also lead to a full lost and found and fights.

Policy two needs to be brought to action and policy one should never be passes.

Do not allow phones to be used at school at all!

Sincerely,
