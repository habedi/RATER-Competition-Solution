I love soccer so much and it has taught me how to become such a better person!

Since I love soccer so much, I think it would be a great idea for all students to get involved with a extracurricular activity. I agree with the decision that all students must be in at least one extracurricular activity because they help students learn to work as a team and have sportsmanship, they help students live happier and healthier lives, and lastly they help students make more friends that share similar interests.

I think for all of these reasons it would be a great decision!

First of all, I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it would help students learn to work as a team and have good sportsmanship.

Knowing me personally soccer has taught me a lot about how to work as a team rather then by myself. When all of us leave high school we will most surely are going to have to use this trait.

It is very important to have a good education, but I think learning to work as a team is equally or even more important than that.

Even if you didn't do sports having good sportsmanship also happens in other competitive activities.

It is always good to know when you win or lose to always be respectful to the other competitors.

Next, I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it helps students live happier and healthier lives.

It is proven that teens who participate in a sport are more unlikely to do drugs and alcohol, then kids who dont do any sports.

Obviously if you do sports it will keep you active and you will be healthier that way too, but if your extracurricular activity is not sports you will still be getting healthier because you up and moving, rather then just staying at home and doing nothing.

Doing an extracurricular activity would also make you happier, because you are doing what you love and you feel like you have a purpose, because when you sit at home and do nothing you feel worthless and that is also where metal health becomes a factor.

Lastly, I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity is because you can make lots of new friends that share similar interests as you.

I know lots of kids at our school who it is hard for them to reach out and make some new friends.

This would be a great opportunity for them to branch out and have fun with some new people.

And because they are share similar interests as you you would probably get along with everyone great!

I know personally, that I have made some new friends from soccer and I am thinking about trying out for volleyball next year, which would be another opportunity for me to meet new people.

These are all the reasons I agree with the decision that all students must be in at least one extracurricular activity.

It helps students work as a team and have good sportsmanship, it helps students live happier and healthier lives, and lastly it helps students make more friends that share similar interests.

From my own personal experience , I think everything I said was very valid and these thoughts should be considered if any school is thinking about incorporating this rule.
