Where i'm from in Generic_City,Virginia, mostly all high schools, middle schools and elementary school give out summer projeccts and packets to children elementary summer work was the easest of them all to me , i coild do the work so fast because they were simple to me, i would loved to go over my packets i did at school over the summer it helped me and it was fun. Back in them days teachers gave good work and it was understable work not like now days. But as i got into jr highscchool i really dont remebering doing summer work for 8 grade or 7 grade,But in 6 i had some type of work it was a thick packet one my thickest ones now that i rember about it ,But it help now so i cant complain. Now i'm in highschool, they dont give out summer work here at Generic_School. My first year here i was doing well first nine weeks, second nine weeks ,thrid nine weeks came i was slacking but when fourth nine weeks came i pull my stuff together i manage to get it together .i could got help over the summer but here at henrico high school you gotta pay for summer school a couple hundred just for one class and mind you i need at least 3 who got a couple hundred out the blue nobody so when i got to 10 grade i had to play ketchup
