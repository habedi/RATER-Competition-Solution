The Face. It is a natural landform. We know this because if we look at the picture from 2001 the face looks more like a hill than a face. However from the picture in paragraph five we can see a rock that sort of looks like the top part of a torso. Which could suggest that this is some mutalated giant. which indeed could lead to the existence of aliens.

Although this landform looks that way it has a ton of holes in it. which could have been from land slides such as our rock slide. It could just be an illusion. It could be just a normal hill and our camera has made it look more like a face due to the thick clouds. The Face could be an actual mountain that has eroded to look like a face. However if the existence of aliens is true and they made this "face" then doesn't that mean that they have seen what we look like and that they are amoung us watching us.

In conclusion the face is indeed just a landform because there are no such thing as aliens. The Face is a butte such as the one that Garvin desribes in paragraph 12 " It reminds me of Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho." So the face is a natural landform on The Red Planet.
