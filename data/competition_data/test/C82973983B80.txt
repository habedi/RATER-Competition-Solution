I am extremely for automatic cars. They seem like a great idea to help get rid of reckless driving and such. The only problum is who to blame if you get in an actsident. That would be a mess of lawers and people with different opions, but that's when we learn and make laws to help prevent messes like that.

I am for the automatic car because it would be very convinient for people who can't drive that well and also they use A LOT less gas then regular taxis. So we can help save our natural reasoruces.

Humans now adays only care about money and power, they care little to nothing how they affect the enironment around them. We now have the technology to take some of that power back for the "little guy", but you don't want to use that technology? This could change the world, and we have had it since 2009?

In conclution, I believe we could work around all the tiny flauhs and change the world with this techology. So I'm very pro-automatic cars.
