Dear TEACHER_NAME:

We've been told you are thinking about making community service for students a requirement. I respectively disagree. I think that we should make our own choices on how we want to spend our time and community service doesn't really relate to academics. Also, requiring it isn't the only tactic. Read on to see the reason for my opinions.

To begin, we have the right to make our own choices on what we would like to do after school.

Its not right, in my opinion, to force us to do something we don't want to. Granted, community service a noble way to spend your time but some kids aren't partial to it. I invite you to put yourself in our shoes and consider our feelings toward being forced to participate in community service.

Secondly, community service doesn't have to relate to academics. I can't see the purpose in requiring this when it won't assist in our learning or education. I hope you understand that what we do after school hours is our time. We can choose to spend it any way we want. School and community service are two different subjects.

My final reason is that making community service mandatory isn't the only way to influence our after school activities. You could imply the idea and give us some positive things about it. You could send letters home about other ways to spend our free time with community service. I'm sure there are other tactics to make us perform community service.

In conclusion, Thank you for considering my opinions. I hope you think about it when you are deciding your decision. We have the right to make our own choices, it doesn't relate to acedemics, and its not the only tactis
