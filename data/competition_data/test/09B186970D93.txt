my reasons to think that the face or rock formation on mars that looks like a face is just a natural formation because many scientists figured it was just another martian mesa whiich was common around cydonia.

also many conspiracy theorsts say that they are hiding something when actually defenders of the nasa budget wish they were an ancient civilization on mars also few scientists believed it was an alien artifact also when they took another picture 10 times sharper it revealed thatt it in fact was a natural formation.

but not everyone was satisfied so they took another picture with MGS but it was not easy because It was hard to to find the exact position of it and they had to look throught wispy clouds.

they also took a 2nd photo which was extrodinary because they used the cameras maximum resoulution which would show anything such shacks pyramids or planes you could see what the were what the picture actually showed was butte or mesa landforms common around the american west.

therfore this evidence proves that the "face" on mars is just a natural landform common n the american west on our planet.
