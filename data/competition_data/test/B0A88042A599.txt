i agree that all students must particiapte in atleast one extra activity,to help kids, and help students be more creative, if kids do sports they would have more energy. and would need to stregnthing their bones. if kids do stuff like sports, activities it will be more fun. working on the year books seems fun because you can see the students in your classroom faces, and also i think student council would be cool too its almost like being a real counciler. and i think if parents let their children do sports i think its a good thing because the students are learning how to do sports and etc. i think extraccuricular activites like art, paint, drew, sketch and dances and more little parties. i think they should do these activites for all ages. the more students that Join the more funnier and creative it will be. students can learn aot of new things by doing sports, and joining in fun and creative activites. sports is a very hard thing to do because you have to keep practicing n practicing til you get better at it. alot of kids do sports after or either during school hours while in gym class. activities are fun for little or big Students. i think for when students do activites the parents or guardians should Join as well with their children.Â
