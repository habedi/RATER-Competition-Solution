I wanted to convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, lets see how I do.

The Seagoing program is a lot of work, but it changes your life. The Seagoing Cowboys program is awesome, you can change people's lives. If you join the program you can also go traveling, such as cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of United States, thatonly took about two weeks. Also you can travel to China and only take a month.

Have you ever seen or cared for a horse? Well if you become a Seagoing Cowboy you could take care of animals, such as horses, young coes, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke claims you can as well have fun on your trip at sea. He says you can play baseball and vollyball. The Cowboys play with them, they played where the emty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis touraments or fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and playing around passed by time.

If you do choose to join the amazing Seagoing Cowboys program, I hope you enjoy it. Have fun!!!
