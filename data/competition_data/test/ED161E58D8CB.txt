The advantages of limiting car usages can be more fresh air, reduce smog, and might be a relief not using the car all the time. Cars have been the most reliable resource in transportation allowing people to go where they need to but it seems like its going down. More people buy less cars and travel without polluting a lot. Many countries took the initiative to have car free days and see how life is like.

Vauban, Germany is an example of a car free society gaining more and more residents. Limiting our car usages is more efficient then using them everyday. Try taking the bus or ride a bike and see how much better it is then being cramped in a car. 70 percent of Vauban's residents don't own cars and 57 percent sold theirs to live in Vauban. Hiking and other alternaives for travel are growing while cars are reducing. Sometimes people can't afford cars or rent one for usage.

Many countries are trying to reduce the usage of cars to clear pollution and allow more ways to travel. Beijing, China is the most polluted city in the world from all the cars and factories they have there. Paris even realized they needed to cut back on car usages and banned odd and even license plate cars usages knowing the smog and pollution was rivaling China. In a week the smog cleared enough for cars to be used again. Cars have a huge impact on civilization.

Bogota, Colombia's Car-free day is a big success. It was a great way to take away stress and lower pollution. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city along with replacing uneven sidewalks with new smooth ones. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Thats how the constructions of 118 miles of bicycle paths are made. The most of any Latin American city.

The United States is in love with cars but it seems like less and less people want to buy one. Given by the technology we have now not that many people travel to see a friend or family member.
