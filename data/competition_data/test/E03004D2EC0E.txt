Dear principal,

I have heard of the two possible policies involving the usage of cellular devices, our cell phones, and I would like to say that you should consider policy one. Policy one, allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as the phone are turned off during class, is a better policy as many teens love using the cellular devices to stay in contact with friends and classmates. I for one love talking to my peers using my cell phone , and its pretty boring to not be able to do such things as texting and during out lunch periods and other free time that we have and the opportunities during those times is very tempting for some teens. I know if policy one were put into place I would be very happy as well would other students as it most teens love freedom and providing this freedom will bring some sort of satisfaction to them. Policy two, do not allow students to have phones at school at all, is a very bad idea as teens are very rebellious and would cause them to use there cell phones even more as an act of rebellion towards the leader. If a compromise is reached which I say is policy one then the rebellious acts of the teenagers will simmer down and cause less rules involving our cellular devices to be broken. Thought this will not stop all students from still using there cellular devices during class so i suggest that if a student is found using there cell phone during class that this privilege is taken away and will be returned once the teacher thinks the student is trustworthy. So please as a proud student of our school put policy one into place and we promise you will be very pleased with the results.

Sincerely,
