Im all for usig this technoligy to read emotions. It could help out alot with identifying depresion in people and why they are. Also, this tech could help identify whether a person is telling the truth or not. We could us thhis tech in legal debates or court cases just as much as in the school for experiments. This tech puts on a whole new meaning to body lannguage.

One way it could be used,asi said n the intro, is in legal debates. In the artical, it states that the software can detect if the face you make is forced or an actual smile/frown. This means we can see if a politician is lying about his/her claims during a debate. Not only that, but the software also comes up with a percentage of each emotion on one expresion. This new software can revolutionize the way we see expresion.

We could also use this technoligy to identify wether or not a person is depressed or not felling well. As i said in the paragragh before, the software uses percentiges to identify how sad, angery, or happy a person is. So, if we used this on someone who looked aas if they are depressed, we simple use the software to calculate the differences. In this way, saving many people from suicide and therefor, helping them as well.

In conclusion, this software will revolutionize the way facial expresion are reconized. It will help so many people in so many different ways. But this, this is just the begining of our technological advancment in life. Soon, we might even cure magor disesis.
