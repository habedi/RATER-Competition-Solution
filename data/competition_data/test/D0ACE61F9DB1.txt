Students who attend school online from home have possible advantages to complete work with time andÂ can study easier. Another possible way that students can learn from home is having a good friend by your side and always telling you to not give up and pay attention to what the teacher is explaining to the class.

Disadvantages of online home school are the completion of the notes everyday to keep up with they topic the teacher is going with the class; you might get distracted with your phone or do something that is not paying attention to the teacher while they're explaining the topic of the day. And I really think that students should just go to normal school and learn the way everybody learns

Another dis-benefit attending classes from home is one , the student might not even pay attention or even write down the notes the teacher is going over with the class. They could get easily distracted by his/her phone every time they start the class. And all of that effects and prevents them from learning what they should be with there teacher.

The advantages of going to a school and not online school is that you will 100% not get distracted unless you are they type of person that likes to mess around with people or just being a class clown. You will be have more time to speak with the teacher about something you didn't understood that class day, stay for review on what the class is going to learn next class.

The similarities between the online school learning and regular school are that they both provide class work and note taking; thats the similarities, but there are some obvious differences like home school is at home and school is in a building with students that want to learn. But the main point is that not only home school is not good for some students but it just might not be for everyone ; home school is basically for the students that don't like to associate with many people and prefer to work alone in peace, that can be worked out with time. It might also be a bit hard for them to fully concentrate like for example:Generic_Name was home schooled and he was easily distracted with his phone and possibly anything , and thats a problem because the teacher can't really get his attention for how far he is, unless he's using video conferencing.
