Luke point of view is about how he had crossed the Atlantic ocean 16 times ,and the

Pacific ocean twice to help people who were affected by the world war two. But before that he didn't cross ocean's ,and travel alot ,before he was working two part time job's in a grocery store ,and a bank.

Luke had a friend name Don who had invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat,but when he had went on the cattle boat he new that something good was going to happen. World war two was happening in Europe in 1945 and alot of countries were in ruins .So luke .and don wanted to help this counry so they signed upto help them.

In August luke and don were sent to Orleans. when they arrived agust luke had said " the day the pacific war ended"

the war had went to greece-with alot of speed. Luke had turned 18 before he went to greece ,by then he could be drafted for military service. When his draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip,they told him to just keep doing that for my service. Luke had made nine trips-the most of anyseagoing acowboy.
