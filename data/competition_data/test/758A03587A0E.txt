Summer is a students time to relax and take a long break from the chaos that endures during the school year. This break is normally for beach trips and days at the pool with ones friends. Although, some schools make students complete projects over the summer to make sure they stay sharp and are prepared for the more difficult school year that lies ahead of them. These projects will either be designed by students or by a faculty member of the school district. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work.

The first reason students should be the creators of these projects is because students know students best. When a teacher designs a projects sometimes they do not always know how kids will respond to the assignment and how that will effect what they are learning. For example if a student is excited for a project they are going to be more willing to finish it and will be more excited to learn about the material it is on, and students know what they like best and are able to create these assignments that will work in their benefit and will make them enthusiastic about what they are doing. Which in turn will make the project more effective towards their education and will end up helping the teachers. All in all, students know what they like best.

Another issue is with facility giving out these projects is they can sometimes overdue what they are giving out. This meaning students will be able to give out a balanced schedule for the other students to complete. For example they will have a set amount of work for two weeks and they will have deadlines within the break. This is not saying teachers cannot do this but students will be able to provide a fair amount of work for the others to do without the students feeling like they have too much to do over a short period of time. This will also in turn make the projects easier to digest for students and not overwhelm them when the time comes for them to start it.

The final reason it would be better for students to create this projects is because a lot of the time students feel that teachers give out work that is not necessary. I have seen this happen all of the time, teachers give out work that does not feel like it is helping with out education but there just to keep us busy or "busy work". The elimination of this work would be very beneficial to not only our time but our feelings toward the project and our eagerness to finish it. If we feel like we are doing work that does not benefit us in any way it does not make us enthusiastic about what we are doing and will only make us go into the school year feeling hostile that the teachers made us do that work. If students were creating the projects they would be able to almost eliminate this work entirely and keep it to only what we need to do. If a student feels they need more practice on a certain topic they would be able to provide that practice option without having everyone else do it if they do not need the practice.

In conclusion, if students were able to create these projects they would be able to reach the other students in a way that a facility member would not. Once again, students know students best. With students making these projects we would be able to change the feeling toward doing school work in the summer from a negative to possibly even a positive if done correctly. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work. By the students, for the students.
