Dear Principal;

I disagree with changing the policy because if most kids have a C average they won't be able to participate. Some kids want to go on to be athletes and if they have a C average they can't get the practice they need. If i was a kid with a C average I would be very upset especially if i wanted to try out for a sport and wasn't eligible.

I also get what that if you move it to a B average some people will try harder to get good grades and be able to do the sports but i still don't think it's right.

A c is suppose to mean average so if they at least have a C average they should be allowed. You should have to worry more about the people getting F' s and D' s. That means they are below average so they shouldn't be allowed to participate. Don't let the C average people suffer because C is still a good grade for some people.

That is why I disagree about changing to at least a B average for people to play sports or do other activities.

Sincerely,
