Dear principal I agree with you with the extracrurriculars. Because someone might be interested in that curricular and extracrriculars wiil help getting the right job like being a R&B sing.

a way that students need extracurricular activitys is that someone might enjoy it. For an example when I joined lego leauge. I didÃÂ´nt know what to exspect when I joined the leauge. When i got there every thing changed for me. that there was lego and robots my two favorite things and I made friends during my time in lego leauge. Even though it took a lot of programing but I enjoy my self while I was there.

Another way that students need extracurriculars activatys is that it will help them get the right job. For an example if you wanted to be a singer when you grow up you would join the middle and high school qouire then join america gots talent. Then get your first ever record deal. Next go to the record company and once your in you sing to them get your album. Then you can be in music videos, talk shows, cartoons, tv shows, and being famous.

In conclusion that is why extracrriculars activitys are important to students no matter what.
