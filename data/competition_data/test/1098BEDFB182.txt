Dear principal,

I disagree, i think we should be able to have a D or a C while playing sports because a D in the school is said to be a passing grade and you would be able to move into the next grade the next year, so in other words it wouldn't be fair if you wouldn't let us play sports with a D or C because its a passing grade. Also when people play sports its hard on them sometimes to keep work up so they get work in late sometimes which may make their grade an C or D which that would mean they couldn't play the sport anymore because they didn't turn in work on time. When they want to play basketball or any other sport and cant because they have a C or D that makes it so they cant play i don't think that would encourage them more to keep their grades up. To some students its hard keeping up a grade c average but now you want them to keep a B average so they wont even be in sports and that means that people could get even more obese than you want them. Telling people they need to have a B or higher average is going to make them not want to play or cant play and the school is going to loose money because we have to pay for sports. If you did this a lot of people might want to move to another school so they don't have to have B average and there goes even more money out the door because you made it so we have to have a B average. If you would change it then you might as well just give up sports altogether because most kids cant keep a B average in school. When and if you do this the school kids wont be happy and just throw their grades down the drain anyways. If you did this then new kids wouldn't want to go to this school and they wouldn't even try going here. This is why i strongly disagree with having to have a B average grade for playing sports.
