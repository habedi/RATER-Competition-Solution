Texting & Driving

Everyday around the United States studies show that one out of ten people are killed by drivers that are distracted by their phones and about 1500 are critically injured. One of the most dangerous and distracting things you could possibly do is texting while driving. It is very dangerous because people who text and drive are putting extra attention onto their phone and that takes away their sight of the road which raises the chances of that person losing control of the vehicle which can cause a fatal crash that can injure the driver, injure another person or even kill the person. When a person is using their phone, their thinking about everything else besides concentrating on their surroundings and driving.

The statistics are very poor, because according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in 2011 3,331 were involved in car accidents and unfortunately died because of a distracted driver on his phone, and 387,000 were severely hurt in vehicle crashes. Also according to a recent search by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute revealed that drivers who are looking at their phones are twice as likely to crash or come close to crashing than those who are paying attention to the road. These statistics are becoming more regular as people start to use their phone more and more everyday, especially those of younger ages.

For this reason it is extremely that we find different ways to terminate this terrible habit of texting and driving. To me I think that one of the best ways to cut this habit is to just turn off your phone while driving. Doing this will keep the driver focused on the road and not the buzzing and ringing the phone makes, this will also stop the driver from texting. Another way is that there are actually apps that can disable your phone while you're driving and another app that can text that person and tell them that you're driving and you'll text them back later. These are some great apps that we can use to our advantage and stop our habits of texting and driving. A great way to stop looking at your phone is that if you have a friend or another person in the car, have them check the phone while you're driving so you don't have too.

Something that is highly important is that a lot of the states have begun to pass a couple laws that orders drivers to completely stop texting and driving. But we need to be profound: none of these laws will work efficiently if the people of the society don't understand that texting while driving could have immaculate consequences, not only for the people driving but also other bystanders and innocent people. In my opinion I don't think that answering your phone is more important than your life and other people's lives. Using your phone can wait until you get where you need to be.
