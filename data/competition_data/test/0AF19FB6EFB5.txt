Dear principal,

Everyone needs cell phones right? Many students at various schools have their cell phones with them all the time. Many students even try to text during class, even if it means getting poor academic grades. The two new policies that you have proposed, seem to bring a solution. Even though, with all due respect, one policy seems to not be a good idea. I think that policy number 2 is an excellent idea.

I think that policy number 2 is the better choice because it allows students to be more concentrated in their homework, their school work, and their personal school achievements. If a cell phone is allowed to be used during free-time or during lunch, the students may get distracted on what they are supposed to be learning from their teachers during class. If cell phones are to be not allowed in school, the students have a very good chance of not getting distracted while they are in class. This will allow them to be concentrated on their studies, than rather their social life, while in class.

I think that policy number 1 is a very bad idea because students may take this chance to text and take pictures during class while using their cell phones. This may cause a very big distraction towards their learning environment and academic grades as well as their concentration towards the material being taught to them by their teachers. Teachers may also take as a very bad situation because the students in their class would not learn any of the required academic material.

This would also implicate the students getting poor academic grades. The students who would be using their cell phones while in class would get grades such as C, D, or even F. Students may not be able to culminate or graduate because of these scores and grades. These grades would also implicate the results of their CST scores as being very low. This would bring the school's reputation as well as the CST scores to a less appropriate stance towards the LAUSD records.

These are my reasons for choosing policy 1. I think that these reasons are well enough qualified to change your mind about policy 2. I hope you take my opinion into consideration.
