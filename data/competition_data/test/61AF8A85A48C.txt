This technology would be useful is so many ways. Ways that have been mentioned in the article. I am for this technology not against it , it can be used to better and understand alot of people who are stuggling.

This can help students become smarter in subjects they dont understand. It can put the kids who dont understand all in the same class and create a new lesson plan that they will all understand. Like in the article it says ' a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored'. That quote from the article is the main two reasons kids are failing.

This is why im all in for this technology , also when people are going threw things at home this can help them get through it. I think it may be weird at first having a computer that can read how you feeling but for the better it will help alot of people. I also love video games so if this can help advance and make better video games in the future i would love to have it, it can maybe help create classroom games that helps you learn better.
