The mask found on Mars is just a natural landform. One reason is because there is no life on Mars so it is phisically impossibe for it to be created by aliens. This information is found in paragraph 7.

The mask is a natural landform, however many other people beleived it was an alien because they also beleived that some of the markings were in haze, as it states in paragraph 8. The Mars Global Surveyor took a second look it says in paragraph 10. They captured a picture that was in a high pixel quality and they found it to be the best picture taken of the mask.

Many people beleive that the mask is made by aliens on Mars. They beleive this because it looks like the face of a alien or even maybe a human being as it states in paragraph 8. Many people don't beleive it being possible for the mask to be a natural formation. There is lots of debate over this but science has proved that these people are wrong because it is a natural artifact.

In conclussion, many people think that the artifact is made by alien, however science has proved that this is a natural artifact. With that said, scientists were able to capture amazing high quality pictures of the mask.
