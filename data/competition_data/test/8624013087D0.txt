Dear Principal,

I think that we should be able to bring our phone to school and use them during lunch time and other free time, Because we get in trouble, Because we have them out so there for we in trouble if we get caught with our phones out at lunch, and we do not like getting our phone took up, its best that we should be able to have our phone out during lunch. I think we should be allowed to have our phone out at lunch any way. Like what of we need someone to bring some thing from home but we get caught with our phones, So there for we should be able to have our phones out during our free time.

The only time we should have our phones out is during lunch time, but when time to go from lunch all phone should be turned off. Having our phone out at lunch is a privilege though. You have to be a good student to have your phone out, and your grades have to be up. That means kids will make sure that there grades up so that can have there phone out during school.
