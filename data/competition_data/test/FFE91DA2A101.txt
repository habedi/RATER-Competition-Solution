Students should take regular attending classes because they would have much more in public school learning and teaching. It would also be healthier for students to learn it by having them teach it then them having to go on online or videos for conferencing from home.

Many citizens make the decision to let their kids go to a public school or stay home to be home schooled. But in some states they don't require them to decide weather they should let their kids attend a public school or be home schooled the state should make a choice in all that our kids should attend public schools. For the reason that kid and students can be more focused on teaching them by hand then by technology online also it would be a healthier choice for students to get 8 hours of rest. So they can not be sleeping whenever they want too because they are being home schooled. The government and the president should make a choice on what's best for our people and kids. Mostly 50% of our population is around to kids that attend home schooled classes. Parents should take the time to see whats best for their kids so does our government.

In schools teachers and principles have have many ways to work with students who are used to being home schooled they even would like them to have a great time with sports,clubs and activities they would like. Students would have a much more knowable things of their surrounding's of how kids and students should be taught in a matter of way. Some people in other countries or states have been committed that kids would not be allowed to attend public schools only be homed school. The citizens and States provide a lot of wealth to their children's of whats is best for them. But the government should take charge of attending homed school classes can be reckless to not only technology but to our kids and students minds that attend homed schooled classes.

Attending classes form home shouldn't be required because of , late sleeping hours, much of technology use, and not participating in activities.

Students should be required to sleep 8 hours but kids don't get enough sleep for the reason that they use so much technology that would make them stay up but their are other things. Doing homework late, watching TV, playing a sport thats late. Students are involved in other networks that can keep them up from there time to sleep. Video games can also keep your kids up by talking and playing it all night.

Kids have problem with technology by not staying focused on their school work which they do when they are home schooled. Technology has impacted students with social media, games, and computer texting.

when being home school kids don't get to enough energy and power they sometimes don't get the time to do a sport in their free time. some parents that taught their kids to do a sport because they haven't had the experience in activity. Home schooled don't make their kids do clubs or fun sports.

Kids are being surrounded by being home schooled by their parents long distance wouldn't be able to keep in contact with friends or school learning. Parents should provide more things for there kids and students education to be more contacted with the world so their knowledge can be taught more from experience teacher and education learners.
