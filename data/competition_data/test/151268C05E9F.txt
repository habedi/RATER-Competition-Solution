Many plantes in our galaxy have been studyed by NASA many times. NASA studys even other galaxy light years away too, but thay cant study plant that far away llike thay study here. Take venas for expmal. Venus is one of the plants that can be study up close to our plant and also vary simler to our plant many diffent ways. Here are some way that make venus worth study to despite the dangers.

To began with, Venus size and density are vary closely related and has a vary thick atmosphere like we do but, Venus is to much for us to handle. Venus atmosphere is almost 97 percent carben dioxide and over 800 degrees fahrenheit which is remarkable for plant to be that hot.

Next was trying to get a drone into the atmosphere of Venus but it so dense and hot that is makes liquefy metals. There alwas volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and lot of lighting happing.

Last NASA thinks there might have been life on it and blue oceans like ours by studying the features on Venus. Studing Venus from 30 plus miles is still hot around 170 fahrenheit whis is still to hot for humens.

In conclusison, NASA still dont have the most information on Venus as thay like consider we can only study from a ship orbiting safely away from Venus so we can only get a insight what venus is like.
