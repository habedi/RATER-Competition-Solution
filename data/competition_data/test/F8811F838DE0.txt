The Face on Mars is a popular pop icon dating back to 1976 when it was first dicoverd. This face-like landmark has even sparked the minds of conspiracy theorists into believing this is a bona fide sign of aliens or other acient mars civilization. Although it may look like supernatural it has been proven that its nothing more than nature at work.

In Cydonia, the area in which this landmark was found, it is quite common for Martian Messas to form although in this case the shadows gave this land mark facial like features as mentiond in paragraph 2 of "Unmasking the Face on Mars". Paragraph 3 continues to bring this point our by saying "The caption noted a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."

If thats not enough to convince someone that its just a natural landform then paragraph 7 mentions that when Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a 10x sharper picture of this formation, it appeard on a JPL web site that revealed it to be nothing more than a landform. Afterwards they went back a while later, as mentioned in paragraph 10-11, and took another picture that was even clearer and closer to the point of where if there was anything such as an airplane or shack hidden in this rock, it would be seen. When taking the picture it mentioned in paragraph 12 that it was in fact nothing more than a butte or messa which is a common landform in the American West.

All of this evidence can prove that it was not anything created by the supernatural but was in fact just a natural landform coincidence.
