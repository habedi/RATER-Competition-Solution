Dear TEACHER_NAME.

I agree with your opinion because if i have an F why should i do sports i don't take school seriously so why should i then take sports seriously. if i cant take the time to do my homework why should i take the time to go to practice. if i really wanted to play sports i would get my grade up and show/prove that i want to play sports. its not fair to the other kids who are making straight A' s and honor roll and that other kids can just slack and they get a reward. if you have to maintain a b average it makes are school look good. the kids that do their personal best should get all rights do whatever they want. I also think you should have kids that do not do a b average should have field trips taken away and any other awards taken away until they can get their grade up. i mean why should are school look bad because others do not want to put any effort in to school. if you make it a b average then that will give kids a drive to do their best because they want to do sports. For example if i get a c average i am going to want to play sports and i am going to have to have to get a b next time so i study harder then i can do sports but if i don't you should not let me do sports.

my other reason is the kids who have a c average have a drive to do better. For example if i get a d average on my mind i am going to be thinking sports, sports, sports that's my drive and my focus is b average so that's when i get my grade up and i get to do sports as my reward and the others are basically punished for laziness and no effort into school. they should also be put into tutoring classes or programs so that can do better and you can make sure that are school can succeed and where not the worst school in our city we make sure that were the best because you care about your students so you make sure we have opportunities. if you didn't care about are grades you would have us do sports no matter what are grades are showing or what they are about to be. with all the respect TEACHER_NAMEif you don't make us get a b average you failed us as a principle, leader and roll model sincerely,
