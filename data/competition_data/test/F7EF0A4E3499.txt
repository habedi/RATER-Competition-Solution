The technology to read the emotional expressions is cool and all but using it for students in a class room should not be a good idea. Reasons why it would not be a good idea, the first reason is that students do not want to show their emotinal expressions, second reason if they do this and see what they are feeling they may or may not want to talk about why they are feeling this way, and third reason is that some students may not want to do it at all or not confable about doing it.

Many students do not want to show their emotional expression. I know people that like to hide all emotions and some like tho show their emotions even being happy, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. They also do not want to show emotions because they are scared of what people will say or do. And they just do not want people to worry about them.

Another reason why this is not a good idea is if students do this and people see what they are feeling they may or may not try to get that person to talk to them why they are feeling that way. I know from personal experinces why people do not want to talk about their feeling is that they do not know how to talk about how they are feeling or they just dont want to talk about them.

Thrid reason why this is not a good idea is that some students may not want to do it at all ot not conitable about doing it. I feel like their many peole would not want to do this because what they are feeling and some may just want to do just for they fun of it. Many people have their own opions but i feel like students just do not want to do it beacause if they are upset, angry, or depress and other people find out they are feeling that way everone is going to try to talk to them about it. But also it could be they are just not conitable about doing the test at all.

the technology may be cool but it could help people open up or it could put stress on them having everyone trying to get that person to open if they are upset or depress. So this is my reasons why this should not be use in a class room.
