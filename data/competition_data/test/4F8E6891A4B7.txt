Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I hear that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy due to complaints within the school. I believe that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free times as long as they are off during class because it will give students a greater sense of freedom and they aren't really causing any trouble outside of class time.

To begin with, I think we as students should be allowed to use cell phones during time out of class because it would give us a greater sense of freedom. Often times, we don't have lunch with our friends or even people that we know. And since we're not allowed to move lunch tables or classes during free time, we should be able to talk to our friends. I'm not going to lie and say we don't already use them during these times, but one of the reasons we use them is because they are banned. When students think they aren't given enough freedom, we often do exactly what we're not supposed to do. If we were allowed to have them during school, then we would be less likely to abuse the use of cell phones in school. Socialization is a key component to how we will grow and survive in life. If we don't have the ability to talk to people, then how can we be expected to continue growing and maturing? With the help of a new cell phone policy, our generation could grow socially and help make a very unconnected society connect on a more personal level.

Secondly, I believe students should be allowed to have phones during school as long as they're off during class because outside of the classroom, they really aren't doing any harm. If you think back, the reason cell phones were originally banned from school was because kids were using them to cheat on tests and class work. So why do they need to be banned during free time and lunch? I, personally, don't really think they do. It's not like we can cheat on what we're going to eat for lunch or what book we're reading. So let us use ours phones in the time that's given to us specifically every day so we have a break in our schedules. With the new policy, students still wouldn't be allowed to cheat, but we'd also be allowed to talk to our friends.

In conclusion, I believe students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch and free time as long as they're off during class. For one thing, it will give us a greater sense of freedom. Plus, they're not really doing any harm outside of class. so please consider changing the cell phone policy to policy one.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
