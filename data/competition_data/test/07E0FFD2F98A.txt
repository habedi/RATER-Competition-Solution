Nice day to go out with your friends enjoy and yourself, after a stressful week at work. You and your friends decided it will be a good idea to head to a soccer game to cheer your favorite team on.

Y'all give each other a task to bring something to feel comfortable doing the game. Some one bring chairs, snacks/food, and something to drink. You get in your car headed to the game, you at the red light when PROPER_NAME decided to text you" Make sure you got the drinks" light changes you start back driving focused on the text. Out of nowhere Errrrrrrr BOOM!.

Its really not a good idea to text don't matter the cause. You should pay attention at all times because you don't know what could happen. You could injury yourself or even kill someone.

No one would want to live with something on there mind forever remembering bad a bad event.

You should think about other people before you get in your car. Is being on a phone more import than your life and others lives?

Every year approximately almost 22% of Americans are mostly teens who are involve in crashes. While being on a phone talking or texting. You will be better off walking than texting and driving. Texting and driving can be worse than drinking and driving sometimes. The difference is that you have a person that's drunk person that's trying to get home while drunk. But on the other hand you have a person that's on they're phone and driving, but is not paying attention .

Almost every second in different countries you have somebody getting in a accident because of people like this. Since the development of technology this has made the death rate go up. People has been paying more attention to they're phones since phones came out. Not saying phones is a problem, people just don't know what to choose what's important these days. I don't get what's important your life or your phone. Your phone still gone be they're after you reach your destination.
