Diverless cars are they a good idea? There are positive and negative asepcts on this topic. Many still on the subject is it a safe idea for the drivers and pedestrians on the road. Driverless cars completly, can be a safey hazard for the passsengers and the pedestrains. There are possibly more negative aspects on this subject than there are postive here is why.

Driverless cars have been thought of for a while, Google has had prototypes of these cars that can drive independetly under special conditions since 2009. But their cars can't truly ever be driverless but they do have smart systems that alert the driver for hazardous situations that can cause a crash. Yes the idea of driverless cars has evolved and could keep evoloving but there cant be truly driverless cars because of present law. Present law states are written with the assumption that there is a human driver at all times in control. Because of these laws it makes it illegal to test drive computer driven cars in certain states. And laws can be changed but new ones will be in place in order to cover liabilty in case of an accident as so written. There are companies that have plans on releasing cars that can drive themselves in the future whether or not its supported by the pubilc. Automakers will still continue their work with driverless cars assuming the problem with safely issues are solved in the future. But one problem the public might still have against these cars is whether or not the car is better in control by itself or with a human driver who does have caution of pedestrians and other drivers on the road and with passengers in the car. Yes the automakers can try and program their computer systems to do exactly what they are suppose to do but computers dont have the physcological brain system that a person does when commiting a traffic error like a crash that can result in a injury or death. Like said in the passage if an accident were to occur who would be at fault the manufacturer or the owner of the car?

Driverless cars could be a good idea if it had the brain system of a human with causious driving skills and has taken a driving test of some sort but it doesnt its just a computer that has been designed to follow traffic laws and will probably never truly have the safety of passengers and all drivers and pedestrians on the road in mind because it has no mind its a computer. Laws can be changed to continue the research to create the perfect driverless car but safely regulations must be taken in place in order to let one of these cars on the street.
