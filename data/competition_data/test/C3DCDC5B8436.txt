In my opinion, the use of the Facial Action Coding System on students in a classroom could be beneficial. This technology could be used to tell when a student is confused, bored, or enjoying the lesson at hand. While this does have some foreseeable practical application, I feel that most students wouldn't enjoy the thought of their computer watching their every facial expression.

A situation in which the Facial Action Coding System could be useful is when students don't express their confusion. Some students, despite confusion and lack of understanding, won't ask the teacher for help. With the implementation of the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would know if a student was confused and would be able to go and help them to better understand the subject: "A cassroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." The Facial Action Coding System could also be used to determine whether or not the students are bored. If they are, the teacher could ask for feedback and change their lesson plan accordingly.

Despite all of the good that the Facial Action Coding System could bring to the classroom, I feel that some parents and students wouldn't be comfortable with it. At our school, each student has a laptop with a built in camera. Some of them cover the camera on their laptop, and express their fear that they are being watched. This is a fear which I myself dismiss, but it might make me uncomfortable to know that I actually was being watched.

While the Facial Action Coding System could have some practical application, I don't think students and parents alike wouldn't be comfortable with it for classroom use. If the students are bored or struggling with the lesson, they themselves should speak up.
