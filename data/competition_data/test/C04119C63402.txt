The author is making the claim that we should go to Venus, despite the enviroment, to study it and make more sense of it. Some of the dangers that they will have to deal with it extreme heat. Around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Also there is the insane amount of pressure that will have to overcome. The amount of pressure there is around 90 time bigger than our atmosphere pressure. It is even raining sulfuric acid their. Despite all of these problem they will have to overcome, studying Venus will help us understand things better. For example, one of the things we believe that Venus was just like our planet. Have land, full of ocean, etc. But later something happen to the planet which caused what Venus is like now. If would make a machine that will be able to stand the condintions of Venus, we will most likely understand those things better. Also NASA has an idea to where we would be able to send people there. It would be a blimp like vehicle that would hover above the surface and that would allow us in theory to withstand the ground conditions. But that is only the ground conditions, we would still have extreme heat. But instead of around 800 degrees, it would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit. We will most likely be able to complete sometime because of the fact of human curiosity and the want of understanding. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not just be based on danger but on imagination and innovation.
