I agree because everybody should atleast do something instead of just staying home and just play video games all day and they probally might be good at the activity that they joined also and might meet some new friends in those type of actvities like football,track,soccer,basketball and some fun and cool activities. And when you join a team you can travel and win championships earn medals or be the best player on your team or when you do the yearbook you keep the memories that you had at school and all the and everything you had at school. And when you join the dance/prom and probally make new friends or find you a girlfriend. You can stay after school and try to get some good grades if you're not doing good in school and if just stay after school. Also you can like sometype of like homemade rocket for like a project or like a lava lamp and like a robot or something like that. You can pick any activity you want atleast you have fun with it and enjoy it.
