Dear Principal,

I know that u have changed the requirements to do sports that your average has to be a B or higher, but I think that you should change it to C or higher, and I am going to list ,or give you some reasons to why I think you should change the average to do sports.

The first reason that I think you should change the average from B to C is because so many of the best athletes have a average of C and higher. But if you let them have an average of a C that would allow them to be apart of the team and allow there grades to become higher in order for them to stay on the team, or participate. That is one of the reasons why I as a student think you should change the average to do sports.

My second reason is because I wont everyone to have a chance to be active in the school sports, and if the average was B and higher only 1/3 of the students would be able to participate in the activities. I think that most of the students in the school average would come up at least for the season the are participating in because the have something that keeps them motivated so that they will either keep their grades up or bring them up.

And my last reason for why I think you should change the average is because I think that everyone deserves a chance to do what the wont ,and participate in what they want to do in their school. It is really important that a child enjoys the time that they are in school so that they want to go to school after the graduate from high school to further their education. With these reasons that i have provided you with, I hope u take in to consideration of what i think should be done.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
