I really have to explain this again? This is probably the fifth time. Whatever, here goes. First of all, the fact that this 'face' looks like a face is just a coincidence. If there truly is or was life of Mars, why would this massive rock be a sign of it? The earlies picture of the face is an extremely low quality and blurry image taken by a really old camera. Even in the picture from 1976, to me it just looks like a rock, which it is. Newer photos show the intricate cracks and molding on the landmass, there's even 3D models showing what it really is. There is absolutely no way this is something created by a living being. Just look at the size of it! Well, I guess you can't tell how big it is from the photos, but it's miles long. There is nothing that could exist with enough power to make something this huge, yet leave nothing behind to show us proof of foreign lifeforms. So many consistencies in this evidence has to convince anyone skeptical that the Face is just a rock. Got it? I hope you learned something today.
