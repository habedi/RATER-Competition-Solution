Have you ever wanted to travel over seas to amazing countries, but still need a job? If so and if not you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. In the program,you get to do a lot of fun things over seas.

If you are in the program,you get to go to amazing countries. These countries may include Europe, China, Greece, and wherever else they need you. In the story it stated that Luke, (me) , a Seagoing Cowboy, toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It was very fun to stay at the countires and to look at the amazing views as we went through.

In the program, you not only get to travel to amazing places, but you also get to help people and animals too. The UNRRA hired the "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the animals and people. We sail overseas with the animals and take care of them until we can get it to the people.

On the way back, the Seagoing Cowboys get to have a lot of fun playing games. We play baseball, volleyball,etc. We also do boxing,fencing,and other tournaments like those. We do this to pass the time on the way back and for all the hard work we have done over that time period we were helping the animals.

In the story it states that once on a trip I had a near death experience trying to help the animals on the ship. Although this is true, this event is very unlikely to happen, and I am still safe due to a piece of metal coming in my way to save me.

You or a family member should become a Seagoing Cowboy. You get to not only help people and animals, but you also get to travel through amazing countries, and get to have fun on the way back. The Seagoing Cowboys help a lot of people and it is very fun, and for those reasons you should become one of us, or better known as a Seagoing Cowboy.
