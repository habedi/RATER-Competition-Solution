Dear Principal,

Many students like to perform community service because it very important to the community. Some students think it takes up too much of there time. I think students should perform community service even if it does take up there time because its helping the community, doesn't take your time away, and its something you need or want to do.

First of all, its Helping the community. Its helping the community by clean up the earth because you don't want the planet to be all filled with trash. Your community needs to stay nice and fresh. Also you you want your community air to stay fresh and now reek of pollution.

Second of all, It doesn't take your time away. Most students just go home, do homework, play video games, and do chores.

When they don't know that most of the other students are out helping in neighbor hood by cleaning up. Well you think that may take up your time but its not. Your actually helping your community, not wasting time.

Lastly, Its something you need are want to do. Helping keep your community clean may be something you want to do . It can be like a job of some sort. Are maybe its something you need to do like the rest of the students at your school.

In Conclusion, students should help the community.

Help the community because its not a waste of time, who knows you could get payed for it because its cleaning up the community. So help out for you, your community, your school, and your family.
