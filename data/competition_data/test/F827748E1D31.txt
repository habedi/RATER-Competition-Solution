There is a new technology called "Facial Action Coding System" that allows a computer system to read humans emotions by their expressions. This new advanced technology isn't valuable in a classroom enviroment. In a classroom it depends on the reason, and the student for this technology to be used. This system in a classroom can be taken advantage, and not used correctly.

The "Facial Action Coding System" being used in a class isn't very valuable, unless a student is always sad, and not doing well in school. No one wants everyone knowing their personal issues. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" (by Nick D' Alto) it states " The facial expresstions for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Huang, "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression" (para 4). Dr. Huang is saying that there is several emotions, even though people show expressions very little or not very much. Explaing that not everyone shows too much emotion, because some people might be to their selves. But even if a person is more to their selves the system can still read you're emotions even if you aren't really showing any. In the article it explains how the software can recognize the expressions. In the article it states " By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's master piece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)" (para 4). In this qoute it explains the process of the new technology "Facial Action Coding".

Some people won't want their expressions read by people they don't really know.

They also might not even want to talk about thier personal issues, because they just don't want to stress about it or because they don't want people judging them. This system can be taken advantage of for the wrong reasons in a classroom, and not be valuable. If this system is used in a class room it has to be for the correct reasons and not just because you think someone is always "mad" or "sad", and it might not always be the case. It has to be because you want to help a student, because they might be going through a rough patch in life and need someone to talk to. But if this new system is used to help someone, it should be in private; where no one is around.

In conclusion, the new technology " Facial Action Coding System" is not valuable in a classroom. This new system shouldn't be used by students/teachers unless they have a teachers permission and only for a reasonable case. It shouldn't be used a lot, specially in a class room full of students.
