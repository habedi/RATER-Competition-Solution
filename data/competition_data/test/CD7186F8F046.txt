Roderick Heffley once said, "school sucks as it is,why would you do more then you have too?"

Extracurricular activities are just way to much for us and if students don't want to participate in them then you shouldn't force them too. That's why i 100% disagree with the principals decision because students already have so much pressure at school,at home with chores and homework, and with trying to make time for family.

School is nothing but pressure to get good grades so we can pass the grade that were currently resigned in,why would you add more to that pressure then we already have by adding extracurricular activities? Most of us who attend public schools already know the difficulties of trying to get our grades up with stuff going on at home or at school. For example drama ,drama, drama. Most of us have experience this because we attend a public school and you will experience drama at least a couple times in your middle school years,therefore bringing more and more pressure and stress on us.

Family time is a really big thing you should focus on,not extracurricular activities. According to my school 70% of middle school students who play sports or stay back a lot for school related activities miss out on family time. Pretty much all they can do is go home,eat dinner,shower, and go to sleep for the next day. Sounds pretty tiring to me. Now if they enjoy doing that then that's them, but no child should be force to do any extracurricular activities if they don't want too.

Have you ever heard of a thing called chores or homework? Im 99.9 percent sure we all have considering if we live in a home with a lot of people or we have an important class we have to keep up with. If were "busy" with extracurricular activities such as sports,yearbook, and student council how are we suppose to keep up with our chores or our homework. For example in 6th grade i was apart of a student council and we use to meet 4 times a week after school until 6:30 for that whole year. I never had time for anything i use to get home at 7,eat,shower, and then go straight to bed. My mom would always walk in my room and ask if i did my homework, but i would always be asleep because of how tired i was.

In conclusion, making every student at Generic_School do an extracurricular activity is absolutely absurd and uncalled for considering we have other things to do. Students should be able to make their own decisions on whether or not they want to waste their time on something they dont necessarily have to do. So please take a stand and do what is right for us student's who truly have way too much on our plates.
