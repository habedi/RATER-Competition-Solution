There can be many advanteges and disadvanteges to having a car but the advanteges to not having a card greatly outweighs having one. There can be many reasons why not having a car is great but the main three are it reduces pollution, reduces stress, and having less cars reduces the noice pollution in a city. Can you imagine a place with no cars?

First off the main advantage of limiting car use is less pollution. Cars account for 12% of gas emissions in Europe and 50% in America. Without cars the air would be much cleaner and the Smog would be gone over the cities. London had so much smog over the city that they had to cut car use in half with all of their cititzens. After only five days most of the smog was gone and people could go back to driving. Imagine if we had everycar in the world stopped driving we could get rid of most of the smog in less than one week.

Another great point on how limiting car use can help is it will reduce the stress gratly in peoples lives. In the first source a man from Vauban Germany said, "When I had a Car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Also another man from Columbia said during a day without cars, "Its a good opportunity to take away stress..." Most stress comes from roadrage or getting stuck in a major traffic jam. Imagine how stresless people will be without cars

Finnaly reducing car use will graetly reduce the noice pollution everywhere. When you go out side whats the first thing you hear? People? Childrean? NO, all you can hear is the engine of cars everywhere. In a city where they banned most cars the sound of childrean drown out the occasional car engine not the other way around. Can you imagine how peacefull that would be not waking up to the sound of cars?

In conclusion having a car can have its advanteges but limiting there use would be far better for people. It would help stop air pollution, reduce stress, and reduce noice pollution in cities and suburbs. Is having a car really worth it?
