Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that you have been reconsidering the school's cell-phone policy. Personally, I believe that you should go with Policy 1 because instead of students having to sneak their phones to read text messages and so forth, they will be relieved when they hear that they must have their cell-phones off during classes, but that they can have them on during lunch periods and other free time. This is also a good, and healthy way for students to improve their social life.

If students are able to have their phones on during free time, they'll be relieved and then they won't turn their phones on during class, drawing their attention away from the teacher and towards their phone. And in this way, students will most likely gain better grades because their attention is fully on the teacher, instead of their phones. It will also prevent them from disrupting the class or drawing the attention of the rest of the class onto them instead of the teacher. So in this case, if you help one, you help nearly the whole class.

This is a good way to improve a student's social life because during lunch, they might want to make new friends and so they can sit at a lunch table and if they feel that they are having an interesting conversation with the other students then they could try to get each other's phone numbers and thereby decreasing the amount of depressed students. Now although it won't completely wipe out the number of sad, or depressed, students, it will most likely make the lives of some better than they were before. If a student would rather communicate with their current friends, instead of make new others, they could text them as well. Now although the student wouldn't get the message right away because they would most likely be in class, it's still communication and they could reply to the message later on.

I find these all to be pretty good reasons to reconsider Policy 1 for the school cell-phone policy. Many students, if not all, would be extremely happy if you used Policy 1. Cell-phones wouldn't always have to be kept away or sneaked out with this policy and grades would improve, making it a better learning environment for other students. I greatly appreciate your time reading this letter. Thank you, again.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
