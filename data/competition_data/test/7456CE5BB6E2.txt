Ever wanted an opportunity to have fun and learn new things after school? Well extracurricular activities are perfect for that plus more! The principles decision to make extracurricular activities mandatory is incredible. After all, extracurricular activities are a great way to make new friends, learning new things, and give you an opportunity to help the school out.

The first reason that mandatory extracurricularÂ activities are beneficial, is you can make lots of new friends. In clubs you are surrounded by people with the same interests as you. This gives you an opportunity to share things with other people, connect, and work together. Whether it's on a sports team, or in the year book club you interact with new people and make some new friends. So get out of the house and make some new friends by joining an extracurricular club!

The second reason that they are beneficial, is think about all the new things you can learn, by joining extracurricular activities you learn new things through social interactions, or improve on pre-existing skills. Either way you learn tons of new things in these clubs. Also these clubs already exist, so why not join them? By not joining you are wasting the opportunity to learn and more importantly have some fun!

Finally, one day you can put some of these clubs on your resume. It might sound crazy but it's true. If you are trying to get a job relating to coding, and you took the coding club as a kid, you can slap that on to your resume! That could be the difference between you getting the job and another person getting a job. You never know! My dad told me that he still remember some of the things he learned in a coding club and still applies that knowledge today. These clubs are free knowledge so take advantage!

In conclusion having mandatory extracurricular activities is beneficial because it gives you many social opportunities, you can learn many new and exciting things from these extracurricular activities, and these extracurricular activities can be used throughout life. If you school does not make this mandatory, you should join a club anyways. But choose wisely!
