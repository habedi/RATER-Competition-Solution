From saving money to having less polution, limiting car usage  has its advantages. Many believe that having a car is needed to operate in today's society. While others think it is a last resort when all other transportation opprotunities are unavailable. While they both have good points, it is said that less car usage has its benefits.

A good benefit is less polution. In source one of " In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosental discusses of a Vauban, a tighted fitted community suburb that is a growing trend in Europe. Despite having to be restricted to using your vehicle, passanger cars are only responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe while the United States experiences 50 percent in some car-intensive areas. Then in source two of  "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer tells about a ban that France enforced to help clear the air from the world known city of Paris. With cold nights and warm days it caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission and that was when it was enough for France. Due to such a ban, enough smog cleared from some passangers could drive again.

Another is more communitiy interaction. In source three of " Car-free day is spinning a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky tells of Bogota, Columbia and its program of spending its citizens to experience a day without a car. Millions Colombians either hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work. Instead of one single person being stuck in their car through traffic, they had many people placed in one bus. Due to such a wonderful opportunity many people felt less stressed. More people were seen together then by themselves that even parks and sports centers were blooming throughtout the city.

Another benefit would be less traffic. In source four of " The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal discover in recent studies of new generations buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer lincenses. As people ride the busses more, carpool with friends or even just mobiliy connected with friends instead of driving less traffic has occured. Since this has been going on pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commericial and public transportation traffic are woven into connectednetwork to save time and consverse resources.

Cars, the nicotine in a cigerate, can hurt our earth. From studies shown limiting car usage can bring its advantages.
