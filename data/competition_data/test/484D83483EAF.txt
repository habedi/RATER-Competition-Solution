Ring! the final bell has rung its now officially summer. Though there is still school work to be done, teachers have designed a summer assignment to complete. Although some may believe otherwise teachers should design summer projects because they know what they want students to learn and keeps students mind in shape

Your grocery shopping, and you discover you need milk. You know what milk you need to buy. Teachers are the same way over summer assignments. Teachers know what they want students to learn over summer. Learning the material a teacher assigns over summer ensures that the student will be ready for the upcoming class in the fall. It also keeps the students busy with work. If students didnt work they wouldnt be successful in life. An example is Mark Zuckerberg, he created Facebook. Mark had a dream about a giant social media platform that you can share things with anyone and keep in touch with friends all over the world anywhere and anytime. The next day Mark started Facebook from his basement. He went everywhere to get investors to invest in Facebook. The dream happened Facebook is currently the leading social media platform for millions of people. He wouldnt be where he is if he didnt work. Students should follow in his footsteps. Students should learn what teachers assign them, and be inspired to learn and work. Who knows maybe they will have the next big idea that will change the world.

Have you ever went to the gym and worked really hard and woke up the next morning barley being able to move. Your mind is the same way. It has to constantly be learning and reviewing to keep information. This helps teachers when assigning summer assignments. When school starts after the break students are familiar with topics from the assignment. If students dont do or review the assignment they will lose some of the learning they acquired from the past school year. This can happen to anyone, It has happened to me. I forgot to do my summer assignment during my freshman year. I walked into the first day of school clueless. I was lost and confused. Nothing made sense to me. It was almost like my teacher was speaking a entire different language. Now I make sure I do them so Im ready to learn on the first day. In addition, my friend Generic_Name she did her summer assignment. she had a pop quiz on the very first day of school. She got a 82%, if she didnt do her assignment she would have gotten a bad grade. Students should do the assignments teachers gives them. It keeps students from forgetting information, and students can even learn brand new information students have never learned before.

Some may say students should design summer projects because they know what they want to learn. About 67% of students have been over worked in the past year. This shows that students needs a break over summer.

They have completed 9 months of school non stop. Students don't want to learn anything else. Its now summer all they want is a break. They want to go hang out with friends, travel, etc. An example of this is my friend Generic_Name, She took 3 advanced placement classes in the past school year. She was in school for 7 hours a day and did homework for another 9 hours by herself. When summer hit all she did was relax and not stress over the work or test she would always have to rush and complete the next morning. She did 16 hours of school every day for 9 months. Shes not going to do any school work over summer, shes doesn't want to learn anything, all she wants is a break. If the summers projects were up to the students like Generic_Name the only assignment they would assign is to relax. As a result, she will most likely forget information she learned from the past year and put herself in more stress and work.

Teachers know what they want for students, and they design an assignment that helps students minds stay in shape. Students should embrace teachers assignments. They could really help a students future. They keep students busy. They help with not forgetting all the hard work students did in the past year. Teachers assignments are vital in summer its a teacher job to design them.
