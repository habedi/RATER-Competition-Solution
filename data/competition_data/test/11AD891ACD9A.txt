The author supports his claim well using this article. he does this by providing reasons why we should explore Venus and how we could do this in safer ways than just landing on the surface. He also shows the opposite side of his claim to also answer questions or acknoledge reasons why we shoudn't explore it.

The first way that the author backs up his claim is by explaining ways that we could live on Venus. The author states that NASA's solution would be to hover over the clouds and higher up where the pressure is that of Earth's sea level. By presenting this information, this helps visualize a way that we could stay on Venus more safely to help study it closer than we ever have. Presenting these ideas such as the blimp or the mechanical computers that are explained in paragraph 7, is that the pursuit of Venus helps us innovate and come up with mroe technology to make our lives easier and make exploration of other planets easier. This is the main reason why the author says that it is worth exploring other planets.

Travelling to Venus would be ery difficult but also would also be worth the trip due to the human innovation and insight gained from the planet itself. The conditions closer to the surface of the planet are unbearable for any human at the moment. Tryin to survive under intense heat, an unbreathable atmosphere, and acidic rains would help increase our technological advancements even more. Bringing this new technology that would be found through the exploration of Venus would make our lives much easier. In the end, the trip to Venus would be worth it despite the dangers that lay ahead.
