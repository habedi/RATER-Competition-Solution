I think that the policy shouldn't be changed. Sometimes students have there ups and downs depending on what they're learning about in class. If they have a grade C average then an adult should talk to them and help them find out what it is they're having a hard time on. Whether it's tests or quiz's or maybe even homework. If they are having a hard time with tests and quiz's find a good way for them to study. If it's getting confused on homework or not getting it done to get help before going home and plan their time to do the hard homework first and the easy last because you would have all the time you need to do the hard and then the time left over for the easy. Also they could go to their teachers and maybe stay after school for extra help. If there's a test or quiz coming up then stay after so they can help to make sure they have everything they need to study. During study hall students could go study in the hall or even make flash cards on facts or vocabulary.
