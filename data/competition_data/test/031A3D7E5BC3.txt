Examining Venus is very challenging because of its thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide around it. Even like this the scientists are trying to came close to Venus became Venus may well once have been the most Earlth-like planet in our solar system. We, the humans should pay a vist to our sister planet.

These are a few reasons why we can't get close to Venus, even though we want to.
