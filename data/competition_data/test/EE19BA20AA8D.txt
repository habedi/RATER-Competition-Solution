Do students learned more with the topic they are interested on or with the topic chosen by someone else? The summer projects should be teacher -designed because they prepare them for the following year, they learned more, and they show more interest on it. Although some people might think that I am wrong.

To begin with, they prepare the students for the following year by giving out many topics that will help them in their next grade and in their future. For example when my little sister was going to third grade this year she received a math packet from her second grade teacher to prepare her for third grade. It was full of math problems, she would always be carrying that around and doing the math problems every single day. Now she knows how to multiply and divide with multiple digits. she also asks my dad if he could write some math problems for her.

In addition, they learned more with a specific topic than a chosen one by them. when students are given a certain topic they do a lot of research on it and they are learning facts and getting a lot of information among those topics. They go through many websites and resources that could help then with their topic. by this way they are also preparing themselves for their next school year. They also have a bigger chance to succeed in their life. They gain knowledge by researching information about their topics. Students are learning many things and they are getting stuck in their heads and brains. students have the ability to retain a lot of information in their heads.

Finally, They show more interest in the topic they are given. They tend to focus more in a certain topic given by their teacher, For example, when students have to write a free writing they do not know where to start or what to write about and sometimes they just do not do it , but when they are given one they start writing their ideas right away.

they want to keep writing because they are interest on it. They want to learn about it. They put an effort on their projects. students during the summer have more time so they spend more time working on their projects.

They are interest on it because they have interest topics.

They are more open when they are given a specific topic. because they show interest on it, they work a lot on it too.

In conclusion, summer projects should not be student - designed but teacher - designed in order to make students succeed in their life . When they have a project designed by their teacher they have so many advantages because they do not just write about boring stuff but interesting ones that they learned from it. students are more flexible with a certain topic given by their teacher than chosen by them; therefore, schools should always give teacher - designed projects to student during their breaks. Students are likely to be prepare for their classes next year.
