In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I agree with this suggestion because I feel that studying Venus could help us find out if there was once life on the planet, considering it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. I know this because the article states, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth". This means that their could possibly have been life and human-like creatures just like us.

Although it is a difficult planet to study, scientists find it interesting that there is a planet similar to Earth in many ways. In the article, the author states, "Furthermore, recall that Venus could sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel". This supports the authors suggestion furthermore because although Venus is a dangerous planet, it is sometimes our nearest planet, which means it would take a shorter amount of time to get there. Not only would this be a wonderful planet to explore, but humans are also very curious to find out what is on the planet Venus and what it has to offer. I say this because the article states, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors".

In conclusion, I feel that there are many amazing things that could come out of us exploring Venus, instead of giving up because of the obstacles we are faced with.
