BRINGING CELL PHONES TO SCHOOL

I think we should be able to bring cell phones to school an use them during our free periods. If something bad happens an we have our phones we can call for help. I think that it is ok if we can bring cell phones to school an use them in our free periods. I think that if they let us do that us kids will respect that we have to turn it off during class time in order to use them in our free periods. I think that the you should go with policy one.

Policy two, In my mind is wrong because if something happens when we get off the bus an we don't have our phones with us we would be stuck in that situation, an not only could we get hurt, we could get robbed, kidnapped, an a lot worse.

Plus, what if our parents need to get a in touch with us at school an they cant drive the school, what are they supposed to do then? The answer is nothing. We wont be able to get in touch to know that something is wrong. I mean yeah some kids are not mature enough to follow the rules an not text during class, but that doesn't mean everybody should get punished for it. Cause its there responsibility, they should just get the people that are doing wrong and then punish them, but not everybody else that hasn't done anything wrong. Those are a couple of reasons why I think you should go with policy one, and be able to use our phones in our free periods.
