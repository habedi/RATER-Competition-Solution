A claim that evalulates the pursuit of studying Venus despite the dangers "Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin". also when he said "Striveing to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on its planet its self ,but also becuase human curiosity will likely lead us into many equall intimidating endeavors". Hes knows this is a great risk but he still believes it could be done by a man and also thinks it would be worth it by acomplishing it.

An explanation of the evidence is when the text says "Our travels on Earth and beyond should nit be limted by dangers and doubts but shoukd be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation". The text also says 'If our sister planet is so inhospitable ,why are sciencetists even discussing futher vists to its surface?". The author really wants this vist to planet to go on along with alot of other sciencetists and he keeps convinceing us why this would be such a good idea and not only because the insight to be gained on its planet it self but also fir the human curiosity.

There is alot for us humans to discover mabye some will be found hopefully some will be. There has been discoveries and invintions made that people never thought could possible and these things continue to happen as time passes by thats why believe in Venus trip I think with a little hard work this is totatally possible so theres no stopping the unbelieveable. Incredable remarks contine to happen each one sometimes better then the last some are not so I conclude that the future is abone us and so are bigger and better things.
