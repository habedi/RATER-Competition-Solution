Summer is here! Students and teachers are out of school; they are on vacations, visting family, or being with friends! But what about retaining information from the past year, or learning new information, all while you are doing all of your favorite summer activities? Some schools require summer projects during the summer break so that students have an oppurtunity to continue learning over the summer. The summer projects that are completed by students should be student-designed because, it lallows for the student to be more creative and have fun!

When given the oppurtunity to do a project, students are more likely to complete a project that is based on their creativity. For example, if the student is on an international vacation and left with very little supplies, that student will be forced to be resourceful with his/her resources. With that being said, instead of making the projects teacher-designed, and risking a less creative and boring project, the projects should be student-designed. This will allow the students to come up with their own way of presenting their newly found information through their own creativity with his/her resources.

Student-designed projects give the oppurtunity to make learning fun! A student who is researching information should have a good time while learning the neccessary information to complete to school-required project. For example, if the student is on vacation at a beach, researching information about the ocean, they might go to the beach and explore the natures (all while enjoying their vacation)! The student will not have to stress about finishing their summer project when they get back from their vacation.

Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Some might believe that teachers should design the projects so they are more structured and relevent to what they are trying to teach. But, making these projects student-designed, it would make the project more enjoyable for the student, allowing them to be more creative, and have fun!Â
