Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you are thinking about choosing from two new policies. I have looked through both policies, and my opinion follows Policy 1. Policy 1 states that it will "allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time". I believe this would be a good idea for a few reasons.

First of all there wouldn't be as many students getting in trouble and filling up the detention room because, (I hate to say it), rules or no rules, there is going to be many students who use their phones even if it isn't allowed. For some reason, phones are that much important to some students that they are willing to get in trouble.

Also, some students, even if its really occasional, might have a good reason to use them. One of my teachers once told me that a girl was using her phone, not in a classroom, because her dad had called, who was stationed in a war, because this was the only moment he had time to talk. Another teacher saw her, and she got in trouble. You would have to be heartless not to feel bad for her, at least a little bit.

The reason that cell phones were banned in the first place, was because they were a disturbance in class. So what about outside of class? I can't think of a way they could be a disturbance outside.

I hope you think these are good enough reasons to start Policy 1. This would be a good idea, and make many people happy.

From,
