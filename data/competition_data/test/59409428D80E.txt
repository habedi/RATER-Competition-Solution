i think that would be totally stupid to do that because some of the best athletes have ac grade average. if you did that also no kids would have school spirit. there would be no mascot. no one would want celebrate a team that stinks. it would if there was no good team members. i think it is just a bad idea that wouldn't be good to.

the school would not make money off of school spirit items so there's a let go to.

this would also make cheating more. and it would happen more often then usual and that wouldn't be good for the school.

no one3 would want to go to games be cause we would just be creamed by the outer team and that isn't good either. all and all i don't think that would be a good thing to do o and i just thought of a another reason for this change and that would be not letteng every one play to be fair
