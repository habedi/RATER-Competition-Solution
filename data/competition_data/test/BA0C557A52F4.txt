Facial Action Coding System, a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Personally, I think that sounds like a good, well-built, successful invention. There are a lot of technologies and experiments that haven't worked in the past, but I think this could actually get the researchers somewhere. Technology seems to be increasing everyday and I feel like the new Facial Action Coding System is a good step to make and push forward for the future. The process is starting with a 3-D computer to make a model of a face.

That includes all fourty-four major muscles in the model must move just like you see on a real, living human. Without the muscle movement features, people would not be able to tell how this creature persay, is actually feeling emotionally or physically. The fact that the professers, and scientist are putting that much thought and detail into this object, is mind boggling. The author then explains in paragraph six, that the Mona Lisa demonstration is actually intended to make the people looking at it, smile. It also shows how much the computers can do and make. While looking at this newly invented object, it should make you think about how it was all created and how it all came to be.

Personally, I feel like this new invention called Facial Action Coding System could make a good impact on the kids in the future. Most people nowadays love technology and know how it all works. I feel like it's a good invention and could impact not just humans, but also the world. More jobs, careers, and opportunities will take charge with this new object at hand. I think it could become something new, helpful, and entertaining.
