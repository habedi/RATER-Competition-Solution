Phones & Driving

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. I'll explain why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Today in the year of 2020 people use their phones on a daily basis because at this point that has become the most important thing in any person's life, I mean I can't say anything I use my phone almost every day, but the one thing I don't do is get on the phone while driving.

Well first I want to say that I don't think that it is ok to drive while on the phone it's just not safe, because you could be driving and going to answer the phone at the same time and pull out in to the middle of the four way stop thinking it's your turn to go and get T-boned because you were too busy trying to answer a phone call.

The second reason I don't think you shouldn't be on your phone while driving is because you could be answering a text or watching a video or reading something and that make you distracted from what's around you on the road and it could put you and other people around you in danger, and could get you really hurt some people get hurt so bad they don't recover or they could lose their life.

The third and final reason is because it's the law that you can't be on the phone while on the road you could get pulled over and get a ticket and you could even get your license take from you driving while driving isn't worth your life so what do you want to do answer that text or end up in a body bag.
