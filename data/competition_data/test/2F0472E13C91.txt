I strongly dissagree with the argument that aliens created the face on Mars. The proof is that a little while later after the face in Mars was found scientists figured it was only a Martian mesa, something that was common around Cydonia. The only reason why it looks like a face is because it had unusual shadows on it.

The other reason why I beleive aliens didn't casue the face was because the authors of magazines and other articles thought it would be a good way to enguage the public and attract attention to mars and it worked. Plus when Mars Global Surveyer flew over the area one more time to get a better shot at the face it reavealed that it was just another normal landform and not an alien monument.

Another reason why I think that there was no aliens involved was that someone even compared the landmark to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Plus if you think about it If there were aliens on Mars don't you think that they would've found lots of land formations like the face.
