Dear principle,

I am glad you are considering letting us use phones in our free times and I absolutely agree with that. we might can have a vote on the whole cell phone or not. As long as we respect the new rule and not use them during class time. I see no problem in using our phones in our free time. As long as we don't have any inappropriate items on it.

I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school to use in our free time, as long as there turned off in class. because that is our free time and we should have the privilege of having them out. As long as we are responsible enough for them.

like, we could have a strike system and if we get a certain amount of strikes then we wont be able to use them in our free time. That may also be another way of getting kids wanting to behave. So they can use their phones.

It could also be a bad thing because the kids that are less fortunate might not have a cell phone. Or not even be able to afford a cell phone. kids might not understand their situation at home. That could make them feel bad or maybe even be picked on. We don't wont to start any drama because , we already have enough here.

So, I guess I have mixed opinions about this situation. But I think we should have the strike system and use the phones at certain times. I don't think we should like ban cell phones from school as long as we can use them responsibly and appropriately.
