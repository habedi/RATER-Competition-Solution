Seagoing Cowboys:Helping others and so much more

Do you like traveling, caring for animals, and helping others? Then, the Seagoing Cowboys program is just for you. Luke Bomberger, one of the members, loves his experience with the Seagoing Cowboys. He has done so many things to help the people in need of desperate help. Seagoing Cowboys help others, have to take care of animals, and people who join get to travel often.

First, this program helps others who are in need of help. Some may say, neighbors in their neighborhood could help them. However, some of the people the program has helped were just in a feirce war, you can't even tell it was once a beautiful neighborhood. The progam helped people in Europe just after World War II. I belive the program is really thoughtful, even to people in other countries.

Secondly, the program takes care of animals. Others may believe, they don't need to take care of the animals to help the humans. On the other hand, the animals provide meat, milk, and eggs. The animals will also provide clothing to the humans, the sheep give them wool. I infer animals are really useful animals and good to take care of.

Lastly, people who join travel often. Others may say, you might get injured with all the wars going on. However, most people who go arrive after the war ends so saftey is not a problem. The only time you might get hurt is when you mess around on the ship. This shows, traveling is not a problem, unless you get seasick.

The Seagoing Cowboys program helps others, take care of animals, and they get to travel often. Luke Bomberger has crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean 2 times just to help people in need. So I suggest that you should join the Seagoing Cowby program don't wait, come on down, today!
