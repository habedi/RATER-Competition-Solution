If your thinking about joining the Seagoing Cowboys here are some reasons why you should, it is very unique and you get to go to the see and learn about many new things. You get to experience things you have never seen, it would be so amazing! You could go on very many adventures. Luke says," Im grateful for the opportunity, It made me more aware of people of other contries and their needs."

I think you should go beause it would keep you out of trouble and you would have a great time! You could bring a couple of friends, and you could even bring some of your siblings. I would go, I mean I owuld probably bring my whole family. Maybe, you could go one time by yourself and then go again with some friends and look like a smarty pants because you can show them what you know!

I hope you go and have a great time. I'm about done here so enjoy your day! Just remeber if you go soak up a ton of information.
