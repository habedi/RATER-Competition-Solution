Wouldn't you want to see what it is like on another planet? Or just in space? I would too. Venus is the second planet from the sun so it would not be too far to ttavel there. "Often referred to as Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size. Studies have also shown that Venus was much like us long ago, They say it was probably covered with oceans and has the same surface as us, rocky land, mountains, and valleys.

They do have an idea that could happen. They could stay above the dark cloudy atmosphere and have a temperture way below the normal. 97% of Venus is made of carbon dioxide so it would be much easier to hover the cloud cover planet than try to land on it. NASA has been trying to find other ways to study Venus. They have figured they could possibly "simplified electronics made of silicon carbide been tested in a chamber simulatiing the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted tree weeks in such conditions."

I believe that NASA and other organizations have been trying to find ways onto Venus or hover it because we could possibly learn more and find things from there we never knew about. Many people are unsure about the idea of this but it could possibly help our lives out in some way. So, would you want to see what it is like on another planet?"
