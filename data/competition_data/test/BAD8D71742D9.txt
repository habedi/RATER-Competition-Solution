Having the option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or viedo conferencing will benefit students. Students will stay home and will not come to school. Student will have a different leraning enviorment and lack of communcation.

I believe that it's not a good idea for schools to offer students have the option to take oline classes. It benefit students and techers. If sudents don't come to school to learn, teacher aren't teaching students. Therefore, tecahers don't have to come to school. Schools may be closed if nobody is there.

Teacher might stop working because it might not interest them to teacch students online. Student will be doing their work on their own They will have to find their answer on their own. If a student needs help how will they get it? Things will be different. Students won't make new friends and meet new people.

If students didn't have the option to take online classes at home they will learn more. Studnent will work with others, do group projects, and ask students and teacher for help. Teacher will have to come to school to teach kid. Students will make new friends.

Therefore, students shouldn't take the offer to study online. They should go to school and make new friends, aslo help eachother out. If u help people out you can discover yourself more and find your future.
