First , The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in present , because in the text it says " Numerous factors contriubute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humas to study, despites its proximity to us "

and another example is that it says " Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely " the author supports the idea really well in the story , evidence from the story that supports my claim an introduction is that, our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of the imagination and innovation. Inclusion , NASA has a particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray , the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters . Therefore , studying Venus is WORTHY , many researchers are working on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus, electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Finally , striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
