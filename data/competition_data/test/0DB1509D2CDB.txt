What if students were able to design their own projects for the summer. Would that be more effective in helping a student learn, rather then a teacher designing it. Most students would love to have the chance to design their own projects for summer. They'd be excited about the chance to make the project easy to complete, but who could blame them nobody likes doing work over the summer.

Teachers should design summer projects instead of students. Students are lazy and try to do the least amount of work by any means possible. There are some students who'd try to challenge theirselves so they could actually learn, but the majority of students would make the projects easy. Students just don't like completing hard task, especially when they are on vacation.

By a teacher designing it they will know what to put on the projects. Students don't know what they are expected to learn for the upcoming year, that's the teachers job. Teachers have a list of units to complete each school year. They'd probably put those units on the projects, which would easily prepare the students.

In conclusion the teachers should design the projects for summer to allow students to continue learning over the summer. Also to have the students ready for the upcoming school year. By already showing them what they will learn.
