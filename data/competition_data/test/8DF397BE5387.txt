Principal,

I think you should have Policy 1: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I strongly think this should be one of our rules because like me, and many other students we need our phone throughout the day. We should have this policy because most people would be on track more. We would know what time it was, and stay on track on where we needed to be. We could also easily call home if we left homework or other things we need for school, so more people would have homework to turn in for there classes all the time. So that would lead to more people getting better grades.

Another reason this should be our school policy is that on our phone there is tools to help for math, like the calculator. If a student left there's at home, or lost there's, they could have one on their phone to use.

Another thing is that our phone could help with stress at school. if we have free time we don't want to worry about school and homework, and have a break from it all. Also, we just want to have relax, or have fun for a half hour, or an hour.

Sincerely,

Students of SCHOOL_NAME
