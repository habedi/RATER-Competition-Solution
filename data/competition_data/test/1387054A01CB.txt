These devices were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II . The thought of somputers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears annd levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."
