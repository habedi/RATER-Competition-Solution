In modern times, the ease with which students can learn new information through the internet has offered new avenues to learning that were previously unheard of. Students are now able to search through a vast library of online databases if they do not have easy access to materials for learning or need extra assistance. This is helpful for a majority of high school students as they are now able to gain knowledge that previously would take hours out of their schedules in order to find, much less learn. Even though this is the case, there is no genuine substitute for a proper education. Students struggle most when they can not ask questions or receive information in a way they can understand. Although it offers ease of access, students would not benefit from taking classes at home because it results in a negative home environment, decreases interaction between one's teachers and peers, and reduces the motivation of students to work efficiently.

The most compelling reason as to why a student be able to do their work at home is how much more convenient for them it is. This is a reasonable argument unless one considers the consequences of an education that has a lack of physical substance. This convenience is a matter of how a student is able to handle all of the work that is being pushed upon them. Students no longer are able to have set schedules already in place for them, instead they must create their own schedule and base everything they do off of the classes they are taking from home. The lowered stress of being able to work from the comfort of their own homes is countered by the increased stress of needing to take matters into their own hands while still balancing a life outside of school. In my personal experience in taking geometry over the summer, I found that, while I enjoyed the comforts of being able to relax and work on my own in my own home, it led to the perception of a connection between my home and schoolwork, resulting in an overall negative environment with the constant fear of work looming over me constantly.

Going to school offers students the opportunity to interact with peers and teachers that are able to assist one in learning. Working on an online course means that in order for a student to interact with a teacher or classmate, they must email or text them. Doing this is not only difficult and less efficient, but it also greatly hinders the progress that these same interactions would have physically. While taking geometry online, I had no possible way to contact any of my classmates, and the only way I could interact with my teacher was if I emailed or contacted her through text. This resulted in it being impossible for me to receive an answer within the same day, as I tended to work at night, meaning that if my schedule did not line up with the teacher's schedule, I needed to figure out how to do my work without assistance. This also made it more difficult for me to receive assistance while talking to the teacher, as even when she replied, a full conversation that would have lasted one minute or less with a pencil and paper would require an hour for far less of a return. This essentially removes the possibility of a student to be able to take their work at their own pace, as they are hindered as soon as they encounter a single obstacle in their learning. Working in a classroom, however, facilitates strong and meaningful interactions between their peers and their teachers, as a classroom is designed to achieve.

Classrooms are an environment that are created in order to allow students to work as comfortably as possible in a healthy space. A home, on the other hand, is an environment that exists as a safe refuge from work and responsibilities. Students show less desire to do schoolwork at home rather than in class, resulting in a lower rate of finished homework in comparison to classwork. Through my years in high school I have found that I have significantly less motivation to do work once I have arrived in the safe space of my own home. While my grades on tests are good and my classwork is done on time, homework is a much greater issue that heavily impacts my grades. Although for most classes homework is only ten percent of the overall grade, that ten percent results in a full one point towards a student's grade point average, and countries such as Finland showcase how not having homework boosts motivation to work and learn in school, and offers more time out of school for studying and recreation, allowing for a healthier school environment. This shows how vastly different working from home and working from school is, as working from home causes far greater stress and far less desire to work than simply going to school.

There is no possible way for a student to acquire the same level of education in an online course as they could in a classroom. The ease with which a student is able to work is no consolation for the stress and difficulties they would encounter as they continued learning more difficult material. Although they are able to work at their own pace and have no need to leave their homes, students would also struggle emotionally and physically from the problems with online learning. This trade off is in no way beneficial to the student, as these problems can grow as they continue learning this way with no other students or teachers to accompany and help them when they struggle.
