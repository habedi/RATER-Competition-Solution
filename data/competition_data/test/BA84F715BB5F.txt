The cell phones are nice device because you could all over the country for example Florida to china that amazing but letting kids used their phones at school is not properly because they be texting and sending nasty message to each other is not right for them and one main reason would be not paying attention to the Teacher and the teacher would be mad at them she would give everyone a detention.

Teacher would not like to be teaching for nothing cause they are not going to pay attention and just talk with their friends and the teacher would be mad at them that she is going to tell at the principal about the phones that they need to be taken away from them.

the next thing you know the principal would tell every parents of a kid to take away their phones and keep it home until they arrived home they would used and would be a good idea for the school grade.

in conclusion do not allows students to have phones at school at all first the teacher would get mad and take away their phones another reason is they would send bad massage to each other and might be a big deal because it may said something that hurt their feelings therefore i suggest that do not allowed kid to used cell phones.
