Dear principle,

First of all I think that students should use there cell phones because they can use it to call there parents if they need anything for them to bring to them at school if they forgot any assignments for class so they wont fail. The students are allowed to use them at free times or lunch periods so they wont be a bother when they get into class and wont get in trouble. This is a good policy because students will not get in trouble if they already used there phones on free times and not use them in class they'll still continue to use them as the policy is approved.

Next this policy will let the students to communicate with there friends and family members and it is also important that students should carry their cell phones because if something happens to them they could allow their parents know. The policy will not just help the students but also the people that work at the school because they would have access to their cell phones if they need them in important things. The students cell phones will not be able to be taken away from them and then have to get new ones if there not able to get them back from the school.

Last that the students are only going to use their cell phones for a short time period and not the whole school day so they could use them and they could have something to do. the students will be more active in the school because of them being on there phones and would have enerf
