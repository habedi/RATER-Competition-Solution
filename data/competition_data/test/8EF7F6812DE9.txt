Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that it should be a requirement to perform community service because it's important to help around your community as much as possible. If everyone contributes, the community will be a much better place to live in. If you do choose to make it a requirement, you should let the student choose what type of community service they can do. Some examples of community service are community clean-ups (picking up trash), painting over graffiti, planting trees and flowers etc. and volunteering at local shelters. I feel that if you are going to make community service a requirement, then at least let the students choose what they will be doing. Another reason that this should be a requirement is that, doing community service will make it easier to get into college. It won't promise an automatic acceptance to a university but it could be very good on your application. If you will make it a requirement, this will be a good thing to share with the students because it will sound appealing to them. Some students may feel that they don't have time but, if they "don't have time" for their community, they will end up with a not-so-good community filled with trash, graffiti, homeless animals and dead trees. I think that this should be worth a grade. I also think that there should be a consequence but not a severe one. After all, this would be a requirement not an option. It should be treated like any other subject's assignment.

A clean, safe community is more important than some of us realize, but if you make this a requirement than perhaps it will show people how important it is to keep the community clean and tight-knit.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
