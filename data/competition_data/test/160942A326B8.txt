Are projects over the summer in fact needed for do they just cause misery for students?

More commonly now in high school, teachers assign projects to students over the summer. These projects are called "summer projects." The projects are given to the students to retain and expand upon their learning over the summer. Teachers are the force behind the projects with no saying coming from the students; however, this is how it should be. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it provides for the students to be prepared for the next school year and continues the development of the brain.

Summer projects are given to make sure that students are ready for the year ahead of them. Teachers always have to follow the curriculum with their teaching and assignments, meaning that they will always give what is needed to the students. If a student is partaking in a difficult class their next school year, teachers will commonly assign a summer project. This summer project will follow exactly what the curriculum says is necessary. In doing this, the teacher is giving exactly what the student needs to be prepared for the next school year. This past summer, I was given an optional summer assignment that was given to all students going into pre-calculus. The assignment was thought up and provided by a teacher that knows what the course entails. This summer assignment, that I completed, gave me the proper ingredients to be prepared for the year of the class ahead of me. I am glad now that I finished that project, because the teacher that designed it knew exactly what I needed to know in order to succeed in the class.

The human brain continues to develop until the age of twenty five, and it is important to sustain this growth throughout that time with proper projects provided by teachers. At age twenty five, the human brain finally stops developing and it becomes more difficult for it to learn and adapt to it's surroundings. This is why it is vital to take great care of and continuously develop the brain in the right way throughout these years. With teacher-designed summer projects it is certain that the brain will nurtured and brought up the right academic way. Teachers assign material that is important to know as a developing young adult. These teachers commonly also have experience from their years of teaching and know in what way students should be brought up in order to be successful. With the correct teacher designed summer project students are properly developed in order to achieve their goals, however if designed by the students themselves, this caring thought will not be in mind.

Students can't be left to be independent in these important projects. Although there is the idea that it is important for students to also develop individually in moments instead of a curriculum based way, this is not true for summer projects. Students don't fully know what the next course entails; whereas, teachers do know. Students can create projects that do not allow for them to be prepared for the year, or projects that cover the wrong part of their next course. This individuality also creates a divide in the knowledge of the students entering their next year, creating a difficult circumstance for the teacher of said class. With the divide in knowledge the teacher would have to compensate and reteach certain parts that should have already been covered and reviewed in the summer project. Overall, this student individuality creates many causes in concern over whether the student is ready for their year of a difficult class.

Teachers should design summer projects because it ensures the preparedness of the students and continues the vital development of the young brain in the right direction. Teachers follow the curriculum, and will do the same in their assigned summer projects. This curriculum based activity is exactly what students need to be prepared for their classes. These teacher based assignments also make sure that the brain, which isn't fully developed until the age of twenty five is properly brought up. This brain developed is important to bring up a well rounded academic young adult. Moreover, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is what students need.
