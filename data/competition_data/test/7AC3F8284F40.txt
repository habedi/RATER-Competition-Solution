A grade B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities would be a great policy change. This would be a great change for many reasons, but overall it will help better our students knowledge and the school's overall grade review.

To start off, having a B average would be a great policy change because students will work harder and learn more to be able to participate in sports. For example, my school has a C grade average requirement to be able to participate in sports or other extra curricular activities and my friend RELATIVE_NAME is on the basketball team. He informed me he had a D, and after hearing this policy, he repeatedly studied and aced as many tests as he could in order to stay on the team. So if this works for him, it should work for other students who care to participate in other activities. This policy change will also be a good requirement because it will help students participate more in other activities such as advanced placement classes or even tutoring, showing their appreciation. For example, I knew this boy named RELATIVE_NAME in the 6th grade, he wanted to be on the dance team, but discovered he needed a C average, and he really enjoyed dancing. He had an F in language arts, and he decided to bring it up to satisfy his passion for dancing, so he took on tutoring every Tuesday and Thursday to improve his writing skills, and by the end of that very month, he improved his grade to a B and was dancing at performances every week after school. This is just two of many reasons why a B grade requirement to participate in extra curricular activities would be a good thing, because if students work this hard to maintain a C to participate in activities, they would definitely work harder to maintain a B average to participate in school activities.

Another example of why i think this would be a great policy change is because it would help our school overall. For example ,last year my school offered an FCAT boot camp program to help students better their knowledge before a big test, and almost all 7th graders did significantly well, raising our school average to an A overall. So if just one grade level could do it, if all the grade levels in our school required an average of a B, our schools overall outlook would change significantly. Another example of this helping our school overall is that just last week, our social studies class had a mid-term exam, and everyone in the class received a B or higher, and the grade point average of our period raised significantly. So, if the whole school was to maintain a B, our averaged statistics would significantly change as well, just on a higher scale. That is why i think that having a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities would be a great policy change.

In conclusion, making the grade requirement to participate in sports or other activities a B, would be a great policy change because it will show how much students care , and improve their learning skills, and also improve our schools overall grading average.
