Luke thinks other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. He graduated in Highschool, had two jobs and didnt know his life would change. Don his friend invited him to go to Europe and he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In the passage it says it was 1945, World War II was over in Europe and many countrys were left in ruins. Europe was in trouble because they needed to recover their food supplies, animals, and more. So if anything like this happened you could help them out.

The passage also says In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. Not only you would work in Europe you would be around the world and that could be a unique adventure which you could do if u joined Seagoing Cowboys.

Lastly the passage says Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Just for signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys program it could take you to higher places.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would be really intresting. You might just go to a place you always wanted to go but your not just going there because you want to go your going their for a good cause.
