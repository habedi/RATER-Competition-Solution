When you are taking an AP course in school, have you ever been assigned some sort of project to do over the summer to give you a head start in the course. The summer projects are designed to keep a student learning over the summer to ensure they retain the information that they will start to learn about. Teachers believe if a student can continue to learn even while they are not in school, it will positively effect their grades. Although students-designed summer projects could help the student retain information in a way that best suits them, teach-designed summer projects would be a better option because teachers know what the student needs to learn, the students would just give themselves minimal amounts of work to do, and students could start to get bullied by other students if they thought the summer assignments were too hard or too long.

The first reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because the teachers know what the students need to learn. Usually summer assignments are given to give a head start to students preparing to take a class. If students were to design the summer assignments, they would not know what to put on the projects. For example, if a student is preparing to take AP Biology, and the summer assignment was teacher-designed, the student would be given work about cells or the nervous system, while if the project was student-designed, they could be doing work about chemical compounds which will not be useful to the student throughout the whole course. If the teachers were to design the summer assignments, students would have the best chance at achieving the highest grade for them.

The second reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because students would give themselves easy work that an elementary schooler could do. If a student was given the option to design their own summer assignment, they would most likely give themselves a worksheet to do and thats it. This is because when students are on summer break, they don't think about school, they just think about having fun with friends and doing what they love. If student-designed summer assignments were given, the average grade of each class would most likely be lower than if students were given teacher-designed summer assignments.

The last reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because the students who designed the summer assignments could get bullied. Bullying in schools is most certainly present. If the students who received the summer assignments found them too hard or too long, they would most likely find whoever designed the assignments and put them down. This will also lower the self esteem of the students who made the assignments. For example, if a group of students found an assignment extremely long and hard, they could find who designed it easily. They then could start to bully the student by calling them names and possibly even physically. If teachers were to design summer assignments, this would be one less reason for someone to start bullying another student.

Teachers are the people who design and teach each course a student could take in school. Because of this it would be most logical for assignments that help a student learn should be teacher-designed. If a student were to be given a teacher-designed assignment their grades would be higher. Teachers should design summer assignments because they know what their student needs to know, students would give themselves easy and short work, and students could get bullied because of long and hard work that other students don't like.
