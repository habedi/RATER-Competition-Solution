I think that we should be able to have cell phones at school because that way we can have them for when we get out of school and so that we can call our parents for a ride home. we should have cell phones at school for in case we need the colander or the calculator on our phones. so it would be a bad thing to get rid of cell phones because what if we need to use one of the app's on our phones or something. phones should be allowed at schools always. some people may be using them for texting but it is not right to punish the whole school for what other people are using their cell phones for. so for you the principle of our school that would not be fare to all of the other students who are not using there cell phones in the wrong way but they are using there cell phones in the right way. so I think you should get the people who are not using there cell phones in the right way and tell them that they can't bring there cell phones to school and not punish the people who are not using there cell phones at all. so taking away cell phones is a bad way to get people to stop texting in school or in class so just catch the people whom are texting or talking on there cell phones in school and tell them to stop and if they don't then make it so only those people can't bring there cell phones to school every day. so please don't make it so people can't bring there cell phones to school thank you. bringing cell phones to school should be a privilege not a right. thank you from one of your students.
