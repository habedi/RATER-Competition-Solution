Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so why not satiate all three by participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wide joy by solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!

Firstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved by participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached by all participants makes the friend-finding process much more simple. Exracurriculars also provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel they don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel they do. Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability by building support systems has never been more important.

Next, parents may find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school may not have to do that anymore, at least for a day or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new found friends to get home.

Finally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!

In SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.

Extracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires joy in people is always a good option. Starting with extracurricular activities is a great option!
