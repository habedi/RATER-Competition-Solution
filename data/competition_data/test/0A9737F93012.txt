Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has been brought to my attention that students should be taken a bigger responsibility.

It would help them later on in life as adults. It could also help younger kids who have problems in school. This could also be a good experience for them. Some people may assert because they are lazy and think it's a waste of time. However they are wrong because it could make them a better person. So i think you should make this proposal happen to not only help us but those in need.

It is a good way to show how much we care for our school and the people we love. Helping others in need could result us to be more respectful to one another. doing community services can also lead us to a job or find something that really interests us .It also shows how much we are willing to take part in the community.

There are many kids who have trouble with many different subjects. This is also one way to lead a child into its future. It would also be something they find interest in and maybe want to become a teacher. Eventhough, they don't like it at the and they will realize how much it has helped them. It can be a good experience that they will remember for their life.

sincerely
