Dear: Principle

I am sorry if discontinuous you i desire that you should let us be in sports not only the B' students should be able to play sports. I know that the kids that have good grades should deserved them but a C isn't that bad its a grade you aren't flunking whit a C at least give us a chance.

We will prove you that we could do it were students to and all students have a right to vote for what the school chooses to do. But really thing about it will be a good chance to show that were good to. Imagine every kid wants to play sports if you give us a chance every kid that is in the sports will now that below a C is bad and if they like playing sports that i don't doubted that they will kip there grades up just to be in the team. You will have the best school known for good grades. Not all of us are perfect as you wish we were but we try our best so we should get a chance to. After reading my letter you don't chance of opinion that's up to you but think about if you could give us a small chance just to prove you.

sincerely a eighth grader student
