Through out the past, and till now transportation has been a huge role in our society. In the past boats were the main and fastest transportation man had. Until a man invented the automobile which changed transportation dramatically. These automobiles made it much easier to travel around town, or even across the country. What the people did not know is the harmful effects these automobiles put out.

Automobiles have there advantages which most of the buyers look at, but they did not relize the disadvanges not only are they bad for the enviroment automobiles are the main cause of death. Countries are working to promote either car free, or car reduced communities. As said in paragraph 9 the United States is working with the Enviromental Protection Agency to promote car reduced communities.

You may be thinking to yourself well ''Im not going to ride a bike every I go''. This is true but Im not saying that neither are these agencies they are simply saying that try carpulling, use busses, trams, ect. Riding bikes is a great way of not only transportation, but also fitness, and its a whole lot less exspensive.

In source 4 it states that President Obama has had goals of getting rid of green house gas emissions, and trying his best to make America a more enviromental nation. Studies show that people are buying less cars as years go on, and less people are getting their drivers licence. America seems to be slowing down its rave of the need to drive and own cars, more, and more people are starting to use bikes as their prime way of transortation.

Overall automobiles have been probaly the greatest thing or invention to man kind. Even though they may have their disadvantages. We just need to try as a whole to be less dependent oni our automobiles and try to carpull as much as we. Another great way we should keep doing and promoting is the use of bycicles. Society will find their way through, and hopefully try to be as car reduced as much as possible.
