Many students across the country use sports to get rid of their frustration and to make a better use of there time after trying all day to make their grade a C or better.

If she made it so people that have B' s or higher it would penalise the athletic people and let most smart people do sports.

Many people are iffy on after school sports and current electives.

Most athletic people work all school day to get a good grade and after school to try and stay fit for the sport.

While the teaches talk about the assignments they try all period to finish their homework so they wont have to do it when they get home.

If she made it become needing B' s to do sports many of them would stop trying to stat fit and do there work and the obesity count in the US might increase again.

Yet when you look at most people that r getting a B or higher they try to stay fit at school and do work at home.

You would need more than just PE to stay fit and would probably make the team even worse.

But on the other hand, doing homework at home would keep you grade as high as possible.

Getting rid of spots for people with grade lower then a B would hurt the school and the school's teams even thou it would help keep higher grade people fit.

What would you do if you were the principal of the school with the worse sports team because of your new rule?
