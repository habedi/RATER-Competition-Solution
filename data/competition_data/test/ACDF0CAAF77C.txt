Dear TEACHER_NAME

I've realized you have been thinking about the whole cell phone policy. I strongly believe that you should permit having cell phones allowed and use them during lunch or any free time. The reason I say this is because, don't you think if we spend more time on our phones we would have less of a problem using them during class.

This is the way I see it a lot of kids like texting these days if we check and respond them we would have barely anything to say during class. That way you have less people to see at your office.

We would enjoy our cell phones and put them away during class the way it should be. If you would allow that i personally would be happy. I would actually would be delightful to come to school everyday. I would be so ecstatic and have a grin on my face everyday. I also would participate more and give school 110 percent of my effort. I literary think students would do a lot better at school.

If the school had permit this I think it do a lot better at running. I would be better for teachers, staff, and the students obviously. look at it this way it would be easier to deal with students and they have less detentions to offer and fill out. I personally believe you should go with the idea of letting students use their phone at free times.
