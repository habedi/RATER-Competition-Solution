I agree with the principal that all students should at least have one extracurricular activity .What activities do you like ?

There are plenty of extracurricular activity's you could do along with reasons why you should do at least one activity. It can help out with exercise and staying healthy ,getting things off your mind and having fun. There are plenty of activity's you could do that you could like.

Reason one is there's activities that can help you exercise and stay healthy like soccer,football,basketball and more .You could get more into them and play them while having fun .Example before you play soccer or any other sports you exercise first to be stretched out. In that way you can stay healthy.

Also having fun if you have nothing to do you can do fun activities like working on the school yearbook and helping out in community service .And in sports you can have fun to by meeting new people that like the same activity as you. Having fun in stuff you love. Example you can have fun by spending time with your friends and activities you guys love .

Last activities can help you get you things off your mind and focusing on yourself .You can have so many things on your mind like family problems ,tests,school activities can be a way of getting things off your mind you could do boxing to release anger and stress .And bring out the fun in you .

In my conclusion you should do at least one activity to be productive and be able to stay healthy ,get things off your mind while having fun . I know theres other stuff you need to complete but you can make time for an activity.
