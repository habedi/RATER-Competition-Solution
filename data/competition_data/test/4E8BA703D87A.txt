Dear Principal of school,

I have seen both of the Policies for a cell phone and i feel confident on the Policy number one because of the numerous possibilities a student can use in those free times. While the second Policy does not help the student if in need of help. Policy one can change how the way student communicate between each other enhancing friendships between two students . Also, cell phones can help a student in case of an emergency or any other type of situation, confronting school problems. Students would have access to finding out if there is a test in the approaching class. This would help the student to prepare for a test he or she might have not studied for. The chance to now that there would be a test can help the grade of students by a couple of points. Increasing ones grade can help them in the future of education and open up chooses for them. Even for family problems a cell phone can come in handy to see what your mother is up to or even to check in for your old Grandfather who is in the Hospital. A student's mind might not be clear and wants to check in for her grandfather who is ill. Now

Cells phones are not bad to the student only when it is in use at a wrong time for instance a class that is preparing to have a test. So when this situation happens, the teacher can make sure that all of the students have turned off their cell phone to be sure there is no cheating happening in his/her classroom.
