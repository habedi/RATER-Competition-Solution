To my principal:

Community service is a great part of life that I think every one should have experienced, but I do not think that it is appropriate to have community service as a required task. I believe that if someone were to make you do community service it wouldn't be the same as you doing it out of your will. If it was a required performance then it wouldn't be the same because you don't really intend to help, you would just rather get it over with. It wouldn't have the same effect if you were having to perform community service against your will rather than doing it out of your will.

Yes, community service is outstanding but try putting yourself in our shoes. How would you schedule a date for community service when students like us our loaded with homework every week day and if our weekends is our time to take it easy.

A perfect experience was when I went to a church camp, D-Now, and we had the task of picking up litter from a local park. I enjoyed it but I really didn't feel like I had done anything because I had to do so.

Here's my ideal about community service: I think it would be remarkable if we could have one day of the year to clean up our neighborhoods and even go farther than just picking up trash. We, and I mean everyone in the U.S., should clean the streets of our city, and also feed the hungry because it is COMMUNITY service and no one deserves to go hungry. But then again that's just my opinion.

I hope every man, woman, and child will have the opportunity to take part in community service, not being forced to but actually wanting to do it.

Thank You, mr. Principal for taking the time to read these few lines but I hop
