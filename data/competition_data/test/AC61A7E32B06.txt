Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during the break. The summer assignment should be teacher-designed because it makes things easier for the students, allows students to have an outline, how many pages they should have, and it gives them a topic to write about. If the teacher designs the summer assignment how could you go wrong?

Having a teacher-designed assignment makes it easier for the students. When summer comes it is hard for students to sit down and focus or even think about coming up with something to write they want to have fun. Students already don't want work over their break, however a teacher-designed assignment allows the students to not think as hard as coming up with an assignment.

When you have a teacher-designed assignment that means it comes with an outline which makes it less stressful for the students. When the student is given an outline they can break it down into sections which allows students to do one portion one day and then do the other portion another day.

The outline provides the student with a block of instructions unlike if it were student-designed they wouldn't even know where to begin. Knowing how many pages you need in your paper is another big part of having an outline it allows you to know what is a good stopping place. Knowing how many pages you need helps you to figure out how much brainstorming you need to do.

Teacher-designed assignments give you a topic, a starting point to get you on your way. Having this topic narrows down what you have to write about. During the summer students thoughts are limited it is difficult to come up with a topic because there is lots to choose from it would take some students all summer to think about what to write, but being given a topic makes things even more simple for students. However, most students may think that a student-designed project assignment is better for them because it gives them the freedom to talk about whatever they want in their paper.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during the break. The summer assignment should be teacher-designed because it makes things easier for the students, allows students to have an outline, how many pages they should have, and it gives them a topic to write about. This why schools should have teacher-designed assignments rather than student-designed assignments.
