Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Concerning your choice on whether to make all students do community service or volunteer. I think you should let each student make their own choice. Many people probably have things to do and people to see, so therefore they won't be able to attend the event. I can understand that you may assign everyone to attend the event because some of us can be lazy. I would prefer to come down and help with the clean-up because it would be the generous thing to do. Being able to clean-up your community is wonderful and you should be proud to do it. Taking care of your surroundings is just like taking care of your home, because it is your home. Sure, i would love to come and pick up trash, waste, and recycle a little too. I wouldn't care what my friends who didn't want to clean-up say i would go and help out my community. There is too much time in a day for you to just sit around and waste it, so get up and help out and show some respect to those who really care. To show elementary students that you should clean your community will make them appreciate this world instead of making it into a litter ball. For example, i would wanna be one of the leaders of a group as a position.
