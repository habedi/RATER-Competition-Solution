Dear Principle,

I don't get the point of letting students play sports or other activities when they have at least a grade B average. The tests that the student are taking are more harder and many people have at least a grade C average. A lot of students are unhappy of your decision of the sports and activities. I am absolutely against this decision principle. You can't decide what we do just because you are the principle of the school. Some of these decisions have to be based on the decision of the students. I don't think you know this but students have rights too. We have the right to protest if we don't like it. I mean a grade of a C is still average. To me, if the student has a D or an F on there grades, that is when I think is going to be a problem. They should be the ones that shouldn't play sports or any other activities. Let me ask you a question principle: Do you really want to do this? Do you really want to jeopardise the other activities just because a student has a grade C average. I will give you time to think about the questions that I just gave to you. The decision that you will make after some time will reflect us participating in these sports or any other activities related to the school. But if you make the wrong decision all the heat will be on you, not on the students. I'm not trying to force you to change the decision, but to inform you about what may happen if you make a wrong decision. Again, the student will give you time to change your decision about not participating in sports or other activities due to a student not having a grade B average or not. This is just to inform everyone if you made the right decision or not.

Sincerely,

A Student
