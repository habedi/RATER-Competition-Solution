Dear Principal,

There are pros and cons for this situation. One example of a pro would be that student would work a lot harder.

A con would be that your sports teams and activities could start to do really bad because of the shortage of student participation.

The good part of the rule change is that it will push students to do their best.

It could also help the get better grades and not mess around during class. If they seriously want to play sports then they will work hard to do it.

Students are supposed to be student-athletes.

The term student-athlete means that you are a student before an athlete.

If you don't have the grades to play than you are ineligible .

You have to work hard to play hard and if you cant do it than you need to work harder or seek help from a teacher.

The bad part of the rule change is that your activities and sports teams could start to decrease in size.

It would not be a good situation if your school was known for your sports teams.

I think it is fair to make the B average rule for sports but not for activities. It would be very unfair.

Anyone should be able to join clubs and activities.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
