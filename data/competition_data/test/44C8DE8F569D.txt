The principal's duty is to provide an encouraging environment for the students and to educate the people who want to learn. It's also their duty to provide the same services to one student as to another. Offering only sports or other activities to those that cannot maintain a grade B average at the least is not fair, and the action prohibits those who do not make the cut from enjoying the same as them. Does it truly matter whether or not a student has a good grade in a sport? What does a mind adept in academics truly bring to the table?

There are hundreds of people who have attained scholarships to first tier universities like Harvard or Yale for their ability to play sports, and not for their grade point average. They use their skills in those activities to succeed in life, to pave a career path later on. These people have been playing their sport for years back into their youth, mostly participating in school teams. What would have happened if they had not been accepted into the program for their lack of good grades?

Not everything has to be about intelligence.

Students with slipping grades may be a risky choice to accept into a team, but this is an issue of self-esteem here. True, their grades may drop even further with their occupation in their sport, but what truly matters is their confidence in themselves. If their grades were slipping in the first place, then what chance is there of ever getting it back up? Playing in an activity that they love will surely bolster their confidence in themselves, and that is what childhood thrives on.

Please, principal, consider the following. Childhood is all about relaxation of the mind. Children cannot enjoy themselves in school if they are not allowed the same things that their fellow classmates might be, in cause of a bad grades. This may lead to them to developing a disappointment in themselves, feeling something to be lacking to their person. Barring them from anything at all, like sports and activities, is not for their own good. It is to the students' harm. Let the students enjoy youth while they can, playing for their teams, and possibly create a path in the future for themselves later on.
