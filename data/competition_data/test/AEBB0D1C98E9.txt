Picture yourself in the middle of summer break with no knowledge of how to start your summer project that is due at the beginning of the next school year. Several schools require students to do a summer project so that they can continue learning, even when they are not in school. Normally, the assignment will be created by the teacher for the student to accomplish over the break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because it will be easier for the teacher to grade, the teacher-designed projects will benefit the student's character, and it will help the students be prepared academically for the next school year.

To begin, teacher-designed summer projects would create easier and more efficient grading. After a long break from school, grading projects with no outline would not be the first thing a teacher would want to do when coming back from summer. If students are given a specific project to do, it would be much easier for the teacher to grade and understand, especially when they designed it. It would also benefit the student by giving them an outline of what they need to do and how to execute it properly.

Teachers around the world are looking for ways to improve their teaching. Also, teachers are looking for ways that are more efficient for both the teacher and the student. Projects for students over the summer would help them work on that. Teachers should create summer projects in order to make grading easier and more accurate.

Secondly, summer projects designed by teachers will benefit a student's character. There will be a level of responsibility that will need to be reached by students. The teacher-designed projects will advance them further in knowledge, obedience, and responsibility. Research has shown that schools that do summer projects as a requirement have had an increase in higher grades and basic life skills. Since they will not have to create their own assignment, the students will learn how to accept things that they might not want to. Outside of teaching academic skills, this would benefit the student by teaching them life skills as well. Summer projects should be created by teachers so that the a student's character can grow.

Thirdly, teacher-designed summer projects will give the students preparation and a better knowledge of the classes that they will take the following school year. They will understand what the expectations are, who the teacher is, and how the class is handled. For example, if there is a book project a student needs to complete for an English class that they will take the following year, they will not understand what the levels of expectations are or how to do it properly. With a project designed by the teacher, the student will be able to fully comprehend what the teacher expects and what they need to do in order to finish the project efficiently. Also, students will be able to experience what the class will be like the following year. It will get them ready for the school year and keep their brains functioning throughout the summer break. Summer projects should be created by teachers so that students will be academically ready for the next school year and classes.

Some may say that a student-designed project would be better because it gives the student more freedom and independence to decide. However, it would be hard for the teacher to grade a project with no boundaries. It would cause a carefree attitude for the student, and this would create no expectations, a lack of hard work, and grading struggles for the teacher. Although the teacher-designed project might not interest the student as much, it would give the student a boundary and knowledge of what they are to do.

In conclusion, summer projects should be created by teachers because the projects will be easier and more efficient for the teacher to grade, it will help continue the growth of a student's character, and the student will be fully prepared for the next school year. Not only will students benefit from this, but teachers will as well. Therefore, teachers should create projects to better the next generation of young adults. Students that support this should go to their administration and let them know that teacher-designed projects would overall benefit schools, their students, and future communities.Â
