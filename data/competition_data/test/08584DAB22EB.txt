Dear TEACHER_NAME

Hello TEACHER_NAME this is STUDENT_NAME. This is very unfair to all of the students who go to SCHOOL_NAME. Students who want to participate in activities or sports should at least have a C average or at least a C+ average. There is nothing wrong having at least a B average but the minimum should be a C. I play basketball and also my brother does too. My brother goes to high school so i should know this. In order to do any activities your grades should be a C so making it a B is unfair. And what is really unfair is that if the boy or girl is really good at sports, and is bad at his or her academics. This is really upsetting for the parent and the child. And you know what is really upsetting part is, if the boy or girl wants to be that in his or her life. So TEACHER_NAME I hope after reading this letter that you would not change the school policy to a B average.
