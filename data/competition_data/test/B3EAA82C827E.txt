Summer usually means a school-free time for students, however many schools require summer projects to be completed during their break.

There has been a question posed on how these assignments should be designed.

Some believe the teachers should design the projects, but others argue the students should be the creators.

While some students may have trouble designing their own assignment, summer projects should be student-designed because students will be more likely to do an assignment they created, they will be more interested and involved, and students will have an opportunity to explore and share a topic they are passionate about.

Students are more likely to participate in an assignment they designed.

Summer assignments may be hard to complete simply due to lack of motivation and desire to spend time doing alternate activities.

If the student is the creator of the project outline it can make the assignment more enjoyable.

When the project is student-designed it can make the project fit into a fun summer activity, making it more likely the student will complete the assignment.

If the student is able to design their own assignment, not only are they more likely to participate, but it can peak their interest on the topic.

A student-designed project can heighten the interest and involvement of students.

In some cases, telling a student to do an assignment on something that has not been taught is like telling a plant to grow with no water. In most situations, however, students love the idea of not having to do the same cookie cutter assignment and being able to branch off.

Last year I was given an assignment to do a report on any book of choice, I chose

The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Healy by Alex Healy.

Previous to the assignment, I had watched the movie

Malcolm X

and decided to explore the book.

The book inspired me to, in the future, be some sort of civil rights attorney.

There any many students, like myself, that will go into this project doing something of mild interest, and by the end realize they may want a career in, or are now very passionate about the topic.

Not solely does the project help further the interest of students, but it can also give students an opportunity to research and share their interests.

Student-designed projects grant students an opportunity to explore and share a topic they are passionate about.

Often, in school one can be disinterested in the subjects that are taught; in other cases, they may only hear briefly about a topic that interests them.

A student-designed project gives students a purpose to dive into their interests and share their findings.

The project gives students a chance to research a topic outside of testing standards.

Many students would not further explore these interests or share their passions, unless given a chance to do so, with an outlet such as this project.

Overall, projects should be student-designed.

A project chosen by the student can increase the chance the student will complete it. The interest and involvement of students can be heightened.

An assignment that is student-designed can allow students an opportunity to research and share a topic they feel passionate about.

Students should spend summer doing things they enjoy, even if school work is involved, which can be accomplished when students design their own projects.
