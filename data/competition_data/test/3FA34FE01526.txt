I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students will enjoy it, students can learn new staff, and students can make new friends.

I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students will enjoy it. For example, in my other school we used to pick our extracurricular classes. In class we used to make fun activities. The teacher used to show people our hard work. The principal sometimes gave prices to all the students that work hard in those classes.

I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students can learn new staff. Usually students pic staff they would like to do/learn. In the extracurricular classes you do a lot of activities that make you learn new things in a fun way. For example, when I was in a extracurricular class i learn how to play soccer. I also learn how to make a yearbook online.

I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students can make new friends. Usually in those classes you meet people with the same things/hobbies that you like. For example, in my other school in my extracurricular classes i meet one of my closes friend. We start talking because we both love that class. Also in one of my other favorite classes the teacher made us communicate as a class and now we all friends.

In conclusion, I purpose that all students most take at least one extracurricular class because students will enjoy it, students can learn new staff, and students can make new friends.
