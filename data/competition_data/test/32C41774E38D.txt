Dear, Principal

I think students shouldn't be allowed to bring their cell phone to school because it's a big distraction to student's. Because when students are on the phone they should be learning instead of texting. During class student's should be during work not paying attention to others text messaging.

i say this because it's a very big distraction while in the hall's because you have students text or on the phone while walking and not paying attention so that student may bump another student and it may lead to a big brawl. So i say no to cell phones.

students fighting beacause someone stole there phone. I say this because students who are not

Also cell phone are very big distraction when it come to preteens and teenager's. So if your phone on during class your students wouldn't learn anything because there to busy texting there friends about things that doesn't relate to their lesson they learning in school . I must say that cell phone are a big part of humans life because we need a lot communication today.

If your students not in class they shall be allowed to be on the phone because you have nothing to do and it will also make your students happy because they get to chat and text or even get on mobile web. Majority of the students think school is boring but if you can be on your phone when there's no classes that motivate them, to go to school learn do they work so they could be able to leave class on time for they can chat or text they friends or any one of that such. I don't think this will damage your students in any way what's so ever.

So i think students should be allowed to bring thee cell phone to school.
