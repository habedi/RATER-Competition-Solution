Being able to know what your students are feeling in class may help a whole lot! Facial Action Coding is advance technology to show the scientist what people are feeling. Few scientist are wanting to put these in schools so teachers know what the students are feeling about there class if they sleepy or bored the teachers will be able to know because of the computer.

First, to have this new technology in class is valuable. It's valuable because will be able to understand there student more and if they need help because with the new technology they will know that. If the students need help the computer acknowledge that the student is confused and teacher can go and help them even though they might say they dont need it the facial program will identitfy that they do. It is benefical to both teacher and student because they will be able to know if the person is down or sad depending on how their facial expression is and how they are in need of help of some sort.

Second, the way this new technology works is it uses the way your face is constructed. It using your cheek bones they way you smile and the way you get your wrinkles when you do. But it takes a few scientist to figure it out like Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of FACS. He has classified the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. They all have very basic but common features but not a whole lot. For example, when youre mad your mouth shrinks and your face tightens up. Which is called your orbicularis oris around your mouth.

To wrap this up i am for this. I think teachers can use the help with this new technology.
