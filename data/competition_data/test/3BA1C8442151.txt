My alarm goes off, I check the time it is 6:45, time to start getting ready for school. I am extra excited for school today because it is the first time I have had a class with my best friend in a while. I check my phone to assure that she is going to be there and than I am off to school. Although some may believe otherwise, students benefit better from being in an actual classroom, because they get to have real life relations with other students and do not have as many distractions than if they were at home.

Part of growing up is learning how to interact with different people, many kids do this through going to school and making relations with other students. Going into my freshman year of high school I was the "New Student", I had just moved about 45 minutes from where I had grown up. Coming into Generic_School I did not have many friends, however I knew this had to change. That same year I joined the Cross Country team and made several friends throughout the season, some of which were even in my classes. More specifically I met my best friend, Generic_Name, she introduced me to many of my friends now, and I would not have had as many relations if it was not for her. As well as doing myself a favor in becoming more involved with the school.

A baby crying, the oven making noises, and the T.V raging in the background are just a few examples of distractions students face at home on a daily basis. In school, teachers and staff work several days a week to limit the amount of distractions there are to students. A new rule that was implemented at my school was the "Cellphone Holder", before class students are required to put there phone in the assigned number of the holder. Cellphones are a huge distractment at school, many teens are addicted to their phones and when the phone is left with them they feel the need to check it at least once every 2 minutes. If cellphones are a problem at school, imagine how much more of a distraction they are at home.

While some may say that the benefit of online school is protecting students against bullying, this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is more likely going to increase the chances of cyberbullying. When I was in middle school I broke my arm playing Volleyball, I was unable to attend school for a week. I was given assignments through blackboard and some of my friends. However, two days after my surgery I went to check my Instagram and I saw that several people had commented on my most recent post. Unfortunately they were not the nicest comments, they were comments like "Too bad you didn't break your other arm too" and "It's not like you need your arm". I was victim of cyberbullying and I did not want to acknowledge that, not being in school for a week was one of the worst times of my life.

To conclude it is more beneficial for students to go to school rather than participate in online school because it teaches students the benefits of making relations with other students and prevents the distractions students face at home. With the talk of Covid 19 there are a lot of speculations that some schools could switch to online schooling, while it might benefit saving people from the disease, it still takes away from many kids learning. In addition, it takes away the food and support some students rely on from the school. Going to school plays a huge role in students lives, and it would be a shame for it to be taken away.
