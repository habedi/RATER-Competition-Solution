The Challenges of Exploring Venus is highley dangerous to land and to live on. Its sometimes called the "Evening Star". Its the brightest points of light in the night sky. in our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun. Humans have sent numerous meaning lots of aircrafts to land on Venus. Since there not been a successful space air craft that survived the landing for than a few hours. issues explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Venus's reputation as a challenging plant for humans to study. The planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Venus is a hard planet to explore on giving the fact that its 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed on Earth levels. Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Most importantly researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many of our researchers are working on making innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Other studies show that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted up to at least three weeks in such conditions. By comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure and heat and in all other forces.

"The Challenge of Exploring Venus" would take more than a few years for our researchers to figurer a way to collect the data from the planet. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Venus has value not because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. But also because of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
