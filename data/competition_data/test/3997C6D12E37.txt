When students use their phones in class it could disrupt class. If students just used their phones at lunch or a break of some sort because it could be helpful in case they forgot something at home. The principal should let the students only use phones at breaks away from class.

An example of this is when students text on the phone in class and the teachers are teaching it could bother the whole class if a phone goes off. This shows that when teachers want to teach the students he or she is bothered by so many phones going off. When a student is texting it might corrupt learning for other students that actually want to learn.

Another reason that it should only be allowed on breaks is when students are taking a test and some student has their phone go off by another friend it makes it hard to concentrate on the test. This makes it hard to do anything with a phone going off in the middle of class. Students that use a phone during class should have to taken away, but when it is a break they should be allowed them.

One problem that comes up is when students are authorized that privilege they might abuse it and make fun of their teachers at school and not use it for getting something that they left at home. Teachers should watch students and make sure they are not doing anything wrong or abusing the privilege they have been given.

I believe that students should not use their phones in class, but use them for personal property that they forgot. It should be only allowed at breaks and not for classroom games. That is why cell phones should only be used in breaks only.

The student's phones should only used for breaks because it could disrupt class, they could text in class, but there is one problem to this though. They abuse their privilege and make it so the teachers want to take them away. That is why they should only be allowed on breaks.
