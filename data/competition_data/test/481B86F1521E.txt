Dear principal, many students, if you've heard, don't like the policy change. Because the average student has c' s. I myself am one of those many students. We all love sports and participate in them, you changing the policy would altercate everything. The kids who don't participate in sports would be less motivated to do anything. And without physical "works" they would become lazy, tired, and even worse obese. For example, I have to do homework before I go to soccer. Then, if I didn't have that motivation what would keeping me going then, why would I even bother to do homework? See kids need physical activities. And if you don't change the policy my peers and I will take that as a warning to exceed our learning abilities in school. So we could keep our physical activities and with unchanging of the policy, we will do better .Please notice that my letter to you is not a demand, but a plea .Students need sports. And you need good grades we will both be as happy as a clam. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule for recognizing , and understanding this letter.

Sincerely, a student
