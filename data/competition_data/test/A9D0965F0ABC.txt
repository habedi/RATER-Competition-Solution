i personally don't think its a bad idea or invention in my opinion i think its worth putting to the test. and for students to write down how they feel and then try out the coding system and see if its even a bit accurate on how they're feeling or if it doesn't work and just coming up with random answer on how you are feeling. in my opinion i think it would be kind of good to put to the test in classrooms if it is accurate and does seem to work to scan students feelings in the mornig and afternoon and try to help the ones that are down and all that. so i think it would also be helpful in other places as well if it does end up working and be useful to doctors and what not. so i think it would be a good thing to use in classrooms and put to the test first before putting it in classrooms. so these are my thoughts on whether the use of this invention to read students facial exprssions and feelings is valuable or not. and according to the article they do claim for it to work and that it is accurate but you can't beleive everything just cause someone says it does cuse personally some people will try to persuade people that it work ton get there inventions out there and make money off it.
