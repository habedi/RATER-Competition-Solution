Dear Principal,

I firmly believe that all students should be required to perform community service. The act of serving others helps individuals learn how to be compassionate, caring, and better citizens. Many students already, have contributed to the community by tutoring elementary students and participating in local trash clean-ups. However, some students believe that community service is a waste of time. So, I am going to inform you that it is not.

Tutoring younger students is an example of community service that helps people, other than ourselves. It helps younger students with their homework or questions, and it provides a role model in their life. If a younger student was taught by a person they looked up to then, when that child grew up, they could do the same. They would tutor younger kids just like their role model. This is a positive act, because, their would me more educated kids in our community.

Another community service is trash clean-ups. They may not sound like fun, but they help keep the community clean and beautiful. If more kids in our school picked up a piece of trash in our school or the whole community, the world would be a little cleaner. Cleaning is not that hard either, but kids have to be motivated and with the requirement of community service, they would be.

This whole letter is to try to convince you to try to make that requirement of community service, but it wouldn't be fair if i only showed you one side of the story. A lot of kids would rather be playing video games or watching t. v. in their spare time, but community service does not take a lot of time. Picking up trash in the halls in between classes , or answering a question is considered community service. It only takes a minute! If you make community service a requirement then, we would see more good deeds every day. The community would be a better place and we students, will become better everyday citizens.
