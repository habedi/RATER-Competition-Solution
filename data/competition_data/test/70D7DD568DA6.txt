I disagree because people shouldn't be forced to do community services if they don't wanna do it. The students that do community services are helping out the environment and their also helping others to. One year I did community services and I really wasn't that interested in it. I found that community serices is boring unless you find something to do that you really like. People should have the right to do what they want to do no matter what. people shouldn't be forced to do something that they are not interested in at all.

Some students are very busy to with their families and other activities and sports that they don't even have time to help out in community services. It's not fair for those that are very busy and that have to do other things because their wasting their time on something that is not that important to them, when they could be using their time doing something that would really help them. If the principal wanted the community services to be due at a specific time and the student is really busy or has something else to do, the student can't be forced to do something they don't have time for.

I don't think I would be good at community services because I have a lot of things to do now that I'm in middle school almost going in to high school. In elementary school I would have time to do community services, because I didn't have as much homework and I had a lot of free time I could be spending my time on doing community services and helping out the environment. In elementary school we were forced to do community services, because they wanted us to help out the environment. I didn't like it because it was very boring in my opinon and wasn't gonna make me better at anything.

I would be ok if the principal made us do community services but, I would want it to be on the times were I am free and don't have anything to do. I would like community services to not have a time limit so that I'm not rushed to get activities done at a specific time. If the principal let the students do their activity all year long they would have a lot of time to do their activity.

If I had to do community services, I would probably play basketbal becuase thats my favorite sport. Basketball has always been my sport sense I was a little kid and I'm very good at basketball to. I would help the people that are not very good a basketball to help them get better at it. I would do a lot of drills and activities with those who need help learning how to play basketball.

In my opinion I wouldn't be good at doing a extracurricular activity, because I'm not that good at socialzing with people I don't know.Â
