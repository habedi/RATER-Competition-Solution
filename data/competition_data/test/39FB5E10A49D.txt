In 1976, the Viking 1 took a photo of what was thought to be a 'face' on Mars. The 'face' had a shadow that loomed over the formation; the shadow making it appear as a human face. NASA was thrilled when the Viking 1 captured the picture. A few days after the team found it, NASA reveiled the picture to the public.

Ever since the photo was published, theorists have speculated over what the formation actually was. Many were to believe that it was an alien structure. In fact, it actually is not. The 'alien artifact' is actually a mesa. Mesas are commonly found on planets such as Earth. There would be no possible way that the mesa would be an alien structure.

In the passage, NASA has been taking pictures of it from 1976, 1998, and 2001. Since then, the images have been sharper. In 2001, the picture clearly shows a mesa, not a face. When the latest photo was taken, Malin's team had made the digital picture three times sharper than the rest of the photos. He states that if you were to take a picture of pyramids or other formations, you would be able to clearly see what they were.

The 'Face on Mars' is just a conspiracy theory. No one can actually confirm that there is such thing to exist. If there was such thing on Mars, NASA would probably examine it a bit closer and may reveal to the public about it, but for now, we can only wonder if there really is a face on Mars.
