Exploring venus will be hard to explore since the suface of the planet would almost melt any metals the landed on the surface,But is could be a good planet to explore becuse venus could hold some good finds and new discoveries on the planet ,They call venus earths twin because they are similer in diamiter,but they both are different from each other way differnt,But it would be great to explore for new finds and new discoveries.

Exploring the planet would be quite difficult the gravity is differnt on that planet,also they would need to have more technogly they would need to put a machine up there to explore the planet and see what they need to make as ships ans suits and what meteals would not melt n venus and also what kind of things they would need to explore. Also the clouds on venus are made of of acid,and venus somtimes have an acid rain,and would melt alot of meteals and it would be harmful to alot of objects.

An other challenge would be able to keep water and drink it,sense the surface of venus is 800 degrees fahreheit the water would vapirote on to the air,And it would be very hard to keep it cold,And even the water did not vapirote the water would be way to hot for a human to drink,and the weather on venus is very extream,it would take alot of thought and also technogly to get to venus safly and it would be a challange

The weather on venus is extream with erupitung volcanoes powerful earthquackes and frequent lightning strikes,So we would have to make some really strong and that could withstand all of those hash things that the planet has to offer,and thats alot of things,and you wold also have the right techonlgy that you would have to have. witch would be a major challenge that we would have to face.

Exploring venus would be very diffecult and we would have to put alot of thinking and techonlgy on working towards that but i think it would be worth it to visit there becuse we could find new dicoveries and new finds that could change the would in so many ways,but there it alot of challenges that we would have to overcome but overall it possible but it could ake a long to to devolp and idea and devolp that kind of technogly and it would take years to expore planet venus.
