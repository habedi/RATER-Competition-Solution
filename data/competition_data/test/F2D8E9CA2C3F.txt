By the time a student turns 18, they have spent two-thirds of their life in school. Education and learning are vital to the well being and prosperity of children across the country. However, everyone learns differently. The traditional system of classroom learning might not be the best way of learning for some students. I believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home using the distance learning system because it would allow students to learn without peer distraction, prevent absent students from getting behind in their studies, and allow disabled students the opportunity to learn more comfortably.

First, using the distance learning system would allow students a distraction-free environment for learning. Noisy hallways, rowdy classrooms, and drama between students are all things that can inhibit a student's learning while being at school. By attending classes from home, students can focus more on their education and coursework without any unnecessary classroom distractions.

Next, using the distance learning system would prevent absent students from getting behind in their classes. For many students, missing class is very stressful because they will have to spend extra time finding out what was done in class and, in some some cases, learning a missed lesson completely on their own. If a student is sick or otherwise unable to attend class, using the distance learning system of video conferencing or online learning will ensure that they will be able to keep up their learning in their absence from school.

Finally, using the distance learning system will help disabled students learn more comfortably. For some students, a school environment can be stressful or physically hard to navigate. Schools aren't the most accommodating places in the world, especially since all students are different. No matter their condition, the opportunity to attend classes from home could be very helpful to many students.

Although some people think that learning should only occur in the classroom or in a physical school, that is not the case. The education system is adapting to new ways of learning, and that includes accommodation for everyone. The distance learning system would allow all students the opportunity to succeed, and that is what we need.
