Dear Principal,

A phone is like the whole world rolled up into one signal device. All across the world people use phones on a daily basis, why shouldn't we. Policy 1 should be our number one quality.

People use phones to plan, learn, and communicate.

Society uses phones every day to plan for a better and brighter future. For example if there was a "forgettable" person like myself i would need a phone to remind me what i have to do and when i have to do it. I can see what you might say "why not use your agenda"? Well research shows that 75% of students don't think to look in there agenda at a exact same time you need to in order to make it to where you have to go or what you have to do.

Then there's learning, do you have any idea how many app's you can get to increase your mental capability. There are many things like the math app, the dictionary app, calculations app ,ect.

that help your educational experience go along smoothly. Did you know that music allows you to use both half's of your brain. And guess what there's music on your phone an u connect the dots. Ow and by the way there's an app for that.

Lastly, communication, say one of the teachers are out because they got snowed in and you need her help to check my homework she can still talk to me from her living room and supply me with the help i so desperately need.

Sincerely,
