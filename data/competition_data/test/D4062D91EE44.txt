Generic_Name is depressed. He can only focus on how lonely he is, and how he has no one. He never gets picked in doge ball, he sits by himself at lunch,and everyday he sees others hanging out with each other and having a good time while he is not. His teacher had started a lecture, but Generic_Name could not pay attention, so instead he drew a sad clown on his paper that he was supposed to take notes on. Generic_Name had already heard this lecture before because his teacher before that class had already said it. It was about how High school is starting, and how we should be prepared and to meet new people. That had Generic_Name thinking, he had no one to be stick with when High school starts. He also noticed he had nothing do after school except to go drown himself in homework, since he had no one to hang out with. He noticed this had become a pattern in his life.

Generic_Name gets no time to talk to friends,and he is loaded with work every day. If only he could have a little less work and could do something more fun, like an after school activity. He could make some friends, he has non since all he dose is homework. He could try something new, and if he likes the activity he could even carry on with it in his future. I agree that students should participate extracurricular activity because it will help students to be more social, to get the student to branch out more, and it will keep them open for new things in the future.

The first reason I agree that students should do an extracurricular activity is that it will help them make friends. The activity will have created a group of individuals. This group of people is usually passionate about the activity that the student has now joined, and in any group activity you are obligated to work with those around you. Take Generic_Name for example. He had no friends because he had done nothing except go home and do homework, but if he were to join an something like the basketball team he will make a load of friends because in order to play you need to work with your team. By working together Generic_Name will foam a friendship like bond with his team.

The second reason I agree that students should join extracurricular activities is it will help them branch out more. What I mean by that is it is going to help your student to do something different. The activities will vary based on the student of course, but the student each student will do something different. The more choices we give them the more likely they will branch out and try something new. lets take Generic_Name for our example again. He decides he wants to do an activity, and while signing up for art he sees a flier for basketball. He's never done basketball before, but that didn't stop him from signing up because he just wants the experience of being on a team. Generic_Name is branching out by doing something new.

The Third and final reason I agree that students should do a extracurricular activities is it will open up new opportunities for their future. I believe this is true, because the more things you are exposed to, the more open you are to do something new things. This includes doing something different in your future, like changing your career choice. Take Generic_Name for example one last time. He had always had this dream of being a artist because he loves to draw. When he joined the debate team though, it made him lean towards being a lawyer instead. He still liked to draw but he loved debate. His choice for his future had changed, because of the debate team.

After collecting all reasons why students should do extracurricular activities, Let's go back and re imagine the first paragraph. Generic_Name had a large smile on his face that he could not get rid of, even though he was at school and there was nothing to smile about. He had this smile on his face because he was just told the night before that he no longer has depression. He dose not have it anymore because he is happy from joining the debate team and the basketball team. He has made friends on each team, which he is very grateful for. he found out what he wants to be when he grows up from debate, even though he originally did not know what debate was when he signed up. He is happy because he has branched out, and joined the basketball team. Because of all that he had made new friends and he is ready for his future. I agree that students should participate extracurricular activity because it will help students to be more social, to get the child to branch out more, and it will keep them open for new things in the future.
