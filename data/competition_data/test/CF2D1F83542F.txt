Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Not me! In my opinion students shouldn't have attend classes from home because for me is not necessary you know why? because most of the students should be preparing to put effort and go to the school. Now in today we have a lot of technology to learn more better about what you what to know. We have the school for learn more important things instead of to attend classes from home. Some ladies who get pregnant and then the baby is born has the opportunities to have classes from home because they can not lost their credits or to be absent during their diet that's mean that is a good way.

First, the school would give you a more better choice instead of classes from home because many students should be lazy. For example students who take classes from home can eat whatever time they want and can study at the same time, they can go to the bathroom without any permission and when they want it but it's a problem because we the students have the energy and the capacity to go to school and learn more instead at home. Also we have more problems that some students don't understand and that's why they prefer attend classes from home. Furthermore they don't have any teacher who can help you, anybody who gave you any idea about to resolve a problem. You can not take things seriously and you have to work independently not as a group.

Second, some students have many opportunities and doesn't make a good use, you have to appreciate what the school is offer you because them you still make the same mistake every day and if you want to grow up you have to make good choices. Every students have different thoughts about study some of them waste their time using their cellphones instead they can be study and it's bad because in a future they don't won. Students likes to put endanger their knowledge because they prefer to copy to somebody and not doing the difficult things by themselves.

Third, parents have to put control on this because, if they don't emend their children's them when they go to school doesn't like because in school there are many rulers that the students should follow and if you are in home there don't exist any rule that can trust you and that's why some students are spoiled with the teachers. The school is for people who really want to studied. The students have to be always preparing because is the best way that you can be a great person in the life. If you put part of you in everything even so doesn't matter where you are if in the school or in your home, because when you want something you doing well and you have success in your life.

In conclusion, students shouldn't benefit to have classes from home, is a worse idea that a student can have because this problem could have serious consequences in your life as a young you're. You students had to work striving for better opportunities. Classes from home doesn't help you so that's why you have to go to school and support yourself, if you want to be someone in the life, "Don't be lazy, you can do it, be proud of who you are".
