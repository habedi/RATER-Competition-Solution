Dear Principal,

We as students feel that your new rule that students must have a B average to participate is very unfair. First of all, the majority of the students have a C average. If you were to only let students with at least a B average to play sports, then there would be a drop in the students participating. The few people who do have a B average or higher will join the teams or clubs, but the people who have a C average, who are also the majority, will be excluded.

Second, there are all different kinds of people in the world. Some of us have different strengths and weaknesses. The students who may not do very well in school might be fantastic at football or soccer. As growing young adults, we need to be taught to find our natural talents and use them to our best abilities. By excluding students with a lower grade average, you are telling them, in a way, that they aren't good enough. You are telling them that even though they might have talents that are related to physical activities, they cannot put those talents to use because they don't do well in a certain area.

You shouldn't create rules without learning the back stories of the people it would be affecting. Say there is a student who is alright in all their subjects, a straight B student, but then they fail a math test, bringing down their grade. Now he is unable to join the soccer team, something he had been looking forward to all year. This student is not a slacker, he isn't lazy or rude or disruptive. There is a stereotype that kids who get bad grades are dumb and unwilling to do work. We see them as barbarians, the kids who sleep in class and talk back to the teacher. But the student who failed the math test, he wasn't a bad kid was he? He could have failed that test for multiple reasons; there could have been an accident at home so he couldn't have studied properly, his teacher could have ignored his questions, leaving him confused with the material.

People are sometimes unable to be perfect at everything. Students with disabilities may still be trying their hardest but may end up with C average. So I see it as very unfair and insensitive to make a rule without reviewing the conditions of the students.

The kids will be angry and tell their parents, resulting in many calls to the school or even protests and students being transferred to a different school. The students who get lower than a B average may feel passionately about sports, and I feel that it will cause much unrest in our school community to just swipe the opportunity to shine away from them.

With concern and wishes of well being,
