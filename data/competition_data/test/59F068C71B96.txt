Facial Action Coding System or also known as FACS is a new and revolutionary technology that can recognice emotions. This new technology was invented by Dr. Huang. Dr. Huang created this amazing tehnology so people would know how others are feeling so they can get help. He even goes and says that it could be use in cumpter classes. So would it be a good idea?

The answers is yes. Now the reasons i think its a good idea its because it can help the student to actually enjoy what they are learning . So the reason that i can help the student is because if they feel bored in classroom the computer would notice and it would take action, for instance it could change the lesson. And that is what Dr. huang predicts as in the paragragh he says "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor ". So that is why i beileve it would be a great idea for those computer classes.

In conclusion Facs is a great technology that should be use to help others and to know how they are feeling. Because as we just saw this is something that is usefull and that it could help. Human communication is nonverbal and that includes emotional communication that's why this piece of technolgy could be and will be usefull.
