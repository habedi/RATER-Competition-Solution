Phones & Driving

Smart phones have not been around for a very long time , but they have hugely impacted today's society. People can literally use their phones for anything which is not good , because it has become an addiction for many people. They are using them at the wrong times and of them is while driving. People are so focused on their phones that they risk their safety and others safety everyday. 1 reason that it's bad is because you can't pay attention to the road which can cause accidents and driving with 1 hand is not easy. This a very big hazzard that can be stopped , but people would rather be on their phones.

The National Safety Council report that cell phone use while drivng leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries are caused from texting while driving. This is not good. Too many people are being hurt and some are even killed from these fatal car crashes. The regulations must be changed because this is making the roads unsafe. People should not have to worry about if their life is in danger or not because someone is in on their phone.

In conclusion Phones and Driving isn't safe and it should not be permitted.

The Risk is very high and too many people are being hurt by the situation. We should try to fix this problem as soon as possible.
