Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because as the space program learns more from past experiences, more research can go towards the future and the study of Venus and possibly other planets in our solar system. The human population craves more knowlege. Studying Venus will further our knowlege and help with future development. We learn more by taking risks.

The author supports this idea by giving facts on how studying this planet could be beneficial to us. In the text it states "Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." Since Venus was most like Earth we could learn how time changed Venus from possibly being covered in oceans and could have supported life to extreme conditions far from anything humans have encountered. Also in the text it states "Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." Because the planets in our solar system are very far from Earth it can take a long time for spacecrafts to land and come back if needed to, but since Venus is sometimes ou nearest option for a visit why not give it a chance.

Venus is worthy of time and pursuit no matter what danger looms ahead. When we put in the effort to do something we can do anything, already Nasa is developing plans to study Venus further and inventining new inventions to make this happen.
