Football is a good extracurricular activity. In my words students should participate at least one sports activity. I agree that students should participate in sports because it is healthy,it is fun, and keeps me out of trouble.

First of all, It is healthy for me. For example, I lost a lot of weight when I played football. Likewise, I have to be in good shape,and I need to be healthy to play football.

Second of all, It is exciting to do sports. It is fun because I get to hang out with my friends. One time me and my friend played football together, and we sacked a quarter back together it was so fun.

Lastly, It keeps me out of trouble. For example, if I get in trouble I could get kick of the football team. Another reason is football keeps me busy so I cant look for trouble.

I should participate at least one sports activity. I agree with this statement because it is healthy,It is fun,and It keeps me out of trouble. I will always play a sport because It makes me happy, and I love playing sports.
