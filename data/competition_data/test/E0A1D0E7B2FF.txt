My principle is considering changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade b average. My opinion on that is actually that i think its a good idea. I think its a good idea because then students will be motivated to actually try in school and get better grades. Also they would get to play the sports and activities they want. I realize that many students have a grade c average and probably think that its unfair to have to raise your grade up to a b to play sports but i think that if the student tried hard enough they could get a b and play the sport. A way students could raise their grade is by doing extra credit or just by doing the work and paying attention.

Students don't honestly aren't always motivated to do good in school. That's why many students don't have a very good grade but if they want to do sports or activities and realize they can only do them unless they have a b average then they will get focused and excel in school so they can play their sport or activity. Let me reiterate that I know many students think its hard getting better grades but its not that hard. To boost their grade up they could so some extra work. They could pay more attention in class. I think if they did that then they would get a good enough grade to do what they want to do. If the student isn't getting a good grade because of bad test scores the i think they should study more before the test.

I think getting into sports and activities is a privilege so if the student doesn't even have a b average then why should he/she get to be in that sport? I guess if they have good behavior in school then it makes the chances into getting into a sport better but if they don't have the grade then why should they get into it?

Its simply if you do the work you get the grade. If you get a good grade you get to do sports and activities. That's my opinion on all that.
