Dear Principal, 2-10-11

I do believe that you should make our school do community service.

Every body may not want to do it but its a good way on making us work together and helping our community out. There are a lot of things that each student could do: tutoring, cleaning up liter, raising money for school activity's and so on. Every student could have a place in it they may think that it will be a waste of time but we can show them that its not and is really fun. We could clean up out around the school and plant flowers in the spring time. Have bake sales and dances to get money for school trips and activity's. The students could even dance at the dances with would be fun. Also, tutoring younger kids would be fun too helping them learn to read and write. That would mean a lot to them, seeing older kids come down wanting to help them, that would encourage them to do better. Therefore, i do believe community service should be apart of are school.

Sincerely,
