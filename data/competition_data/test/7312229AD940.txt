The Facial Action Coding System is a good technology but then again not. The software comes with alot of features but it could be a failure. Nobody could just guess someones emotions by looking at there face I dont think a computer sofware couldn't either. It possibly could find the emotions of someone but the results could be wrong because you never know what or how a person is feeling on the inside or outside. Most people don't express there feelings anyway so a computer sofware couldn't find it unless it has the best DNA sofware or best way to find how someones feeling on the inside. The Facial Action Coding System could be a failure in way of just having bad results if someones angry or depressed the software could determine that there happy or surprised. In the Mona Lisa picture she does look a little happy but thats one the inside it says it could find mixed emotions but she could be just smiling for the painting, Also in the instructions it gives you directions to smile or look happy. Maybe the software just tells your on the instructions to smile, so that the software could give you the results as your happy because of the directions of making you smile. The emotion software just gives you ways to smile maybe for you to smile so they can give you results as your happy or excited. In conclussion the Facial Action Coding System could be a failure and doesn't really work.
