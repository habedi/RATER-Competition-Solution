Dear Generic_Name,

I hope this letter finds you and the school staff members okay. The reason I'm writing this letter to you and our school staff members its because I would like our summer projects to be designed by the students. I believe summer projects should be students-designed because that helps students to have the opportunity to express their opinions and ideas about their previous school year. Most students travel out of the country or state. The 30% of the students stay home and prefer to spend time with family and friends.

Students have the opportunity to express their thoughts about their previous year. For example during my summer break I love to write about my previous school year experience and think about what were the wrong decisions I made during that year that helps me to set a goal to do it better the next school year.

Most students travel out of the state or country. For example my cousins, they love to draw and describe what they see in each state or country every time they travel, they love to talk about their experience in each state which is a good things because they are really communicative with school and the community.

The 30% of the students stay at home during their summer break and they prefer to spend time with family and friends. For example my brother stays home most of the time during the summer break and most he invites his friends to come over, they spend time playing with their PS4 but also they like to write letter to members of their family like grandparents etc: also they love to do animal researches so based on that they are able to take notes, make observations and make comments about animals in the forest.

Thank you for taking the time to read my suggestions and I hope I did convience you that summer projects should be student-designed.

Sincerely,
