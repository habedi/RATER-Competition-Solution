Having students participate in extracurricular activities has many bonuses and downfalls. I agree with my principal on making all students participate in at least one extra circular activity because they could discover a new hobby they like, it would help to keep kids out of trouble, and it would help to better kids knowelege on working together.

When students are in their adolescence stage they are finding who they truly are. Extracurricular activities are a great way for young students to find things that they are good at and what they enjoy. After school clubs have a huge variety of options based on things you like. They have options from sports to arts such as soccer, basketball, yearbook, serving on the student council, and many more. With all of these options, young students are almost certain to find a hobby or sport that they enjoy and are good at.

Students of all ages learn things about morals and doing the right thing all the way up to college, and even after that. Extracurricular activities play a big role in shaping the way students act and behave in a positive way. If students do not have the best household life, their after school activity would act like an escape, where they are thought how to be a better citizen and how to help people out who need it. Typically, extracurricular activities happen about 3 times a week, this is not only a way to get students minds to go away from hardships in their lives, it also keeps them out of trouble.

"Teamwork makes the dream work."

This statement is very true, but sadly, some students have never had the chance to truly work together as or on a team using teamwork. I believe that teamwork is a very important skill to have. In extracurricular activities, working in a team is one of the most important tasks that I constantly see. Weather that be in sports passing the ball, in yearbook discussing who will do what spread and what will it be on, or even on the student council talking about things that they would like to see and communicate on how to get it done. There is no doubt that in any extracurricular club you will not use teamwork skills to work with each other and learn valuable life skills.

Afterschool clubs and extracurricular activities teach you so many great life skills and are a great use of time. I would agree very strongly that all students should have to take at least one amazing extracurricular activity in their life to better enhance their lives with so much knowelege and so many valuable skills and morals.
