I think you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" because you can help others when there is a war and give them food. Luke signed up a program called the "Seagoing Cowboys". What they did was is take care of horses,young cows, and mules.

Luke wanted to help those in need so he signed up. He said, "Besides helping people, I had to see the side benefit of seeing Europe and China, but seeing Acropolis in Greece was special." He didn't just want to help people he wanted the chance to see all those places he could see and when he join in the Seagoing Cowboys he had the chance. He maybe thought it was all just helping people but he had the chance to see different places he had never been to. He also took care of the animals. He said they had to be fed and they kept him busy so he never had time to sit around and do nothing!

There you have it all the good things about joining in the Seagoing Cowboys. Well hopefully you woud want to join the Seagoing Cowboys!
