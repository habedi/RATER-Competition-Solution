I dont think that all kids have to participate in extracirricular activities because some families dont have enough money to pay the fees or pay for the equipment needed for that activity which isnt fair and most sports and activities do cost a lotÂ of money. And there probably is some activities that dont cost anything but what if you dont want to to that one what if you want to play baseball for the school team, but it cost one hundred and fifty dollars and your family cant afford or, say you can afford the sign up fee but how about the cleats,the glove,the bat,the bag,the jersey,the pants and the hat all that stuff adds up very quickly and thats a pretty popular and expensive sport.

It's also not fair to the kids who already play a sport or do something else outside of school and you dont have time to do both what are you going to do its pretty stressful just thinking about it and, your still are a student so say you have baseball practice then after baseball you have band practice but the next day you have a huge math test so what do you do school or practice? it can really affect your mental health dealing with all that stress and tension on what your going to do which could cause grades to drop off or, maybe your good at school and you play for a little league baseball team but now you have to do a extracirricular activity for school and your start to get more tired every day. Your performance at baseball drops and your grades drop because you dont have enough time to study and yeah, you could study after practice but by the time you get back it will be nine o'clock and you stay up and study so when you usually go to bed a nine thirty now your going to bed a eleven thirty and your tired the next day and you fall asleep and you get a zero in that class and you flunk the math test because your so tired. It's just not fair because you dont have all the time in the world.

Sometimes you have family issues where someone in your family is hurt or injured or in trouble and you have to be there for them every day but, you have a meeting on Monday so what do you do go care for your family member or even friend or do you to the meeting ? thats the question you have to ask yourself. Say your lost someone in your family but your mind isnt in the right spot and your just not in it that day but you have practice and it makes you more stressful because now you are going to have to pay attention on the next practice because you missed this one its very hard to decide and its not fair at all.

It's all so very stressful just thinking about it and stress can affect you in many bad ways such as attitude, effort, sleep, grades, performance just all around it can drag you down in a bad way thats why I disagree with the principals decision to make every student do at least one extracurricular activity.
