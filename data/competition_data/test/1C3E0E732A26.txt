Every year during summer break, students are required to have finished a summer assignment to help them retain important information required for the classes that they will take in the upcoming school year. While most students find the summer assignments to be unnecessary and detrimental to their summer break, it is still important in preparing students for their classes. While many people believe that students would be more willing to complete a summer assignment designed by themselves, a summer assignment is best designed by teachers because they are aware of what information is important for their curriculum, all students will have the same amount of preparation for the class, and teachers are aware of how much work students are willing to do over summer break.

One reason why people believe that students should design their own summer assignments is that students will be more willing to complete their summer assignment if they designed the assignment themselves. For example, if a student did not like math as much as reading, they could make their summer assignment more reading oriented and lower the amount of required math. While this method of designing summer assignments allows students to be more content with their required work, it will leave the students unprepared for the classes that they didn't practice for as much and bored in the classes that they prioritized in their assignment. For example, if the student mentioned earlier used his designed summer assignment, he would have already read what the rest of the class was still reading in English class and would be behind everyone else in math class.

One reason why having the teachers create summer assignments for the students is better is because teachers are aware of the required prerequisite knowledge for their classes. For example, an algebra teacher would put a more questions about exponential equations on their summer assignment because she knows that exponential equations are an important topic to have fresh in their students' minds when they get back to school. If students were making their own summer assignments, they would be unaware of what they would need to know beforehand in order to be prepared for their algebra class. Allowing teachers to create the summer assignments allows the teachers to streamline the questions to properly prepare students for their class.

Another reason why teachers should design summer assignments is because students should all come into their classes knowing the same amount of information. For example, if all of the class has the same amount of knowledge, then teachers will not have to review basic information that most students are already aware of in order to prevent a few students from failing to comprehend advanced information. If there is a standard for what students should know, then a minimal amount of time is wasted reviewing information that is already known by a majority of the students. It is better to have the teachers create the summer assignments so that the students who know the basic information will not have their time wasted by reviewing what is unknown by less prepared students.

The final reason why it is better for teachers to create summer assignments is because teachers have years of experience working with students and know what is an acceptable amount of work for students to do over the summer. All teachers are aware that students do not want to spend their summer doing school work, so teachers will usually design summer assignments that do not require more than a few hours of work. Teachers will also create assignments meant to ease students back into the flow of a normal school day and adjust their minds back to the required amount of work needed to do well in school. Meanwhile, a student who has designed their own summer assignment will have created an assignment that requires minimal effort and brain power to compete and will struggle to keep up with the assignments they will get once school starts.

In conclusion, while others believe that a student designed summer assignment would be better because the student will be more willing to complete it, a teacher designed summer assignment will be more helpful to the students because hey are aware of what information is important for their curriculum, all students will have the same amount of preparation for the class, and teachers are aware of how much work students are willing to do over summer break. Completing summer assignments made by a teacher will be much better for students because it will better prepare them for the next school year, adjust them to the amount of work required to complete assignments during the school year, and generally improve their experience in class.
