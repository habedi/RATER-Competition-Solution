Computers that are able to read emotional expresssions of students is a great idea!

"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the new emotion-recognition software tracks these movements", This new software could very well change our lives as students for the better. Imagine your classroom computer being able to tell when you are lost, or don't understand the lesson. Then, it changes the lesson for you to focus or understand it better. Dr. Huang predicts, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."

It could improve students preformance in school dramatically.

The technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive,which could prove benefical. " Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication," Dr Huang notes."So computers need to understand that, too." So the computers can almost "calculate" emotions-sort of like it's math homework. If the computers can understand the facial expressions,then it would be like having a personal math teacher as a computer.

SInce humans naturally read facial expressions in our everday,its like a second language among us. We do this everyday!

It only makes sense to incorperate this technology into the class rooms. It can potentially help many students with their academic preformance. Also,it could change the very future of learning in general. I believe that computers with the ability to read emotional expressions is a very good idea.
