Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Have you ever not studied so you could prepare for a big game?

Statistics say, 1/3 kids decide to practice their sport instead of study for a big test. That is why I think you should have a B average to be able to be on a team. When you have a B average that means you can manage studying and being on a team at the same time. Sometimes when you focus on something other than school it can distract you from what is really important. Also, if you set the average to B that is setting a goal for the students; to have good grades so they can play on whatever team they would like.

Many students at our school play on a team; almost half of our students average at a C or below. If every student had to average a B to play on a team, you would see almost half of the students grades go up. Just so they could play on their team. That would mean half of the students grades would be raising.

Raising the average would help about every student focus more on school. You would see improvement in a lot of students. When they focus, they do better, when they do better they are improving , and when they improve they can play on teams. Which is making the students able to manage school and teams.

This would make the entire school improve. Over half of the schoool would raise their grade point average because, they are trying harder so they can play on the team. The teams would also grow stronger because, the students would start learning how to manage their time. For example, from 3-4:30 i will study for my test and 4:30-6 i will practice soccer. This one choice will change our entire school.

Our school will grow stronger and better by getting each to have the average B to play on a team. better teams, smarter students, higher grade point averages, and a better school over all. please, put my opinion in mind.
