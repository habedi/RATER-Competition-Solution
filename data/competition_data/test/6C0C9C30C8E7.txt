Some people may think that the Face is not a natural landform but I am here to give you reasons why the Face IS a natural landform. The reasons I am going to give you are going to be in the paragraphs below, hope you like it and think

''which opinion is better in this essay?''.

The first reason the Face is a natural landform is because 25 years ago something happened on Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship ''Viking 2'', but when the camera spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, then they saw an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a fregion of the Red Planet called '' Cydonia''.

Another reason that the Face is a natural landform is because after a few days , NASA unveiled the image which had shadows forming the illusion of eyes, nose and the mouth. But since it became so popular, the picture has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, etc. They also said that defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. But scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact.

The last reason is that thousands of anxious people were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. But not everyone believed that.

The camera on board MGS had to peer thrrough wispy clouds to see the face, they say perhaps alien markings were hidden by a haze. People are also saying, ''We just dont pass over the face very often''.

But not everyone can be right because some people think its not a natural landform because it could be just a haze from something that was there at that specific moment and time to show that the face was there when it could have really been just a rock and not the Face after all. More reasons to this is that,even though it looked like a face...it couldnt have been, people couldve just seen the face that wasnt really there.

In Conclusion, people have different opinions on what they see and what they dont see in certain pictures. Some people see the face, some people dont see the face at all and that can be a good thing and a bad thing for some people who have different things to say about a certain subject. The Face couldve just been a rock in some peoples opinions, but some people think that it wasnt just a rock, it was an outline of a face.
