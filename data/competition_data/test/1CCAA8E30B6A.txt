Once upon a time in a galaxy far far far far away there was a head. The head of an unknowen thing. NASA has discovered a head and they do not no how it got there or where it came from."My name is Rick and today I will interview Mr H"."Mr H is a astro physist and has been studing this mystoruis face for ten years". "Mr H thinks that the head was created by aliens. "Good afternoon Mr H how are you today". "Im just fine Rick lets get to the topic of the head". "So Mr H why do you think the aliens created the head and why do you think it is on mars". "Well the reason i believe the aliens made the head is so that everyone would be taking about it and the reason its on mars is because the planet they live on is one light year away so thats where they put it". "Mr H let me ask you this for one thing where are you getting your infromation from about this head". "Thats a good question Rick you and I are friends and you work at NASA i got some infromation from you my other source is what i've been hearing on the news they alaways talk about the head". "Mr H that is quiet true what you have told me about your infromation". "Mr H but why do you think they put it on mars". " well Rick the reason i think they put it on mars is because for one they are only one light year away from mars and a spaceship could reach mars and NASA could go up and snap pitcures of it to analize it and find out what is it". "Thanks mr H for this infromation and have a great day see you soon".
