In the article A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves, Luke Bombergerwas as able to particapate in the Seagoing Cowboys program which allowed him to experience adventures and visit many unique places, from Luke's point of veiw. This might convince others to participate in the program as well as Luke did. First of all in paragraph two it states what you do in the begining of being a Seagoing Cowboy, first you have to take care of horses, young cows, and sonetimes have to ship mules overseas. this is important becaues if you do not know how to take proper care of these types of animals you could lose your job and chances of being one of the Cowboys. Next you have to take orders in and ship them your self. It states in paragraph three you have to ship cargos such as loads over one hundred horses puls enough hay and oats to feed them. This is important becaues if you do not know how to ship the orders or don't know were the shipments go to you could lose your job. After all those requirements of being a Seagoing Cowboy or Cowboy (for short) you get to visit amazing unique places such as what it states in paragraph five, Besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seeing Europe,Venice,Italy with a city with streets of water, and on his way to China Luke saw excavated castles in Crete an marveled at the Panama Canlal. But seeing the Acroplolis in Greece was special," he says. This might excite the other people who want to participate in the program becaues, They might of dreamed of going to one of these countries or cities in there furture and this could be there chance to go. Later on after visting your favorit places there can be a risk. As it states in paragraph 7 Luke risked his life by serving as night wtchman as his job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night after making his report to the caption , he slid down a slippry ladder on his backside. he was happy to be alive. But he couldn't work for a couple of days becaues he cracked one of his ribs while slidind down that ladder. this can be a risk becaues you could die just watching the animals but in is a little unlikly if your a very careful. Last but not lest in paragraph 9 it states that, for Luke Bomberger it opened up the world to him. "I'm grateful for the opportunity," he says."it made me more aware of people of other countries and there needs. This could let the person who is thinking of joing this program that this job is not only about hard work to take care of animals and take and deliver them to other countries, it is not about seeing your favorit countries its about what happends when your done with the job wether you come out like nothing happend and you feel like the same or you feel like you have accomplished something imortant. That is what could get the person insterested in joing the Seagoing Cowboys program.
