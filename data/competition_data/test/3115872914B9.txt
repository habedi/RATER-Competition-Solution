Texting and Driving

Texting while driving is extremely dangerous, in 2017 alone, nearly 3000 lives were claimed due to it. The NHTSA is leading a national effort to protect lives and to stop the behavior from occurring. The popularity of cellphones and other electronics has had some unintended and sometimes deadly consequences. An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while texting, including use of cell phones while driving, resulting in injury and occasionally death. Know the facts, be involved, and keep the roads safe.

Texting while driving is the act of using a cellphone while behind the wheel of a vehicle. This includes talking or texting on your phone, playing mobile games, using apps, pulling up a map; anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving. Using a cell phone while driving drastically increases the chances for serious accidents on the road. However, everyone can help in the cause to prevent injuries by ending texting and driving.

The first thing that can be done is to give clear instructions to new drivers. Give easy and simple instructions so they can understand. Before drivers get their licenses, tell them that diverting their eyes from the road for a few seconds could cause serious injury to someone. Leading by example is another action we can take to make the roads safer. No one should text and drive, so show others that by not doing it. If you're an example for others, they'll likely follow. Set some rules for yourself to follow and enforce them on your family.

Texting while driving is not a very responsible or smart thing to do. It can be very serious and lead to harm. Thousands of people every year are seriously injured due to texting behind the wheel. However, we can prevent it from happening, if we set rules for family, lead by example, and teach others we can help stop texting while driving. If you take a stand and make an example, we can make a difference.
