Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to you a concern I have about your policy for the sports participation. I know many of my friends, including myself, cannot participate in any sports because of our grade average.

We want to try out for baseball in a few weeks and it just so happens that report cards go out a week before.

We have been trying to get our grades up in time so we can play sports.

But this doesn't just concern me...

Many other students want to try out for soccer, baseball, and rugby, but they don't have their grades up either.

The attached paper includes the names of the students who want to try out for the spring sports.

They have told me they want to go out for sports and that they are willing to do extra credit for school and spend extra time after school to catch-up on any work they might be missing.

However, some teachers do not allow extra credit and the other teachers leave at around 3:30 p. m.

We are not exactly sure of the whereabouts of our grades; so when can we find out in enough time so we can see what we are missing and work on it at home.

I had also just realized that you were considering putting this in the agenda as an official policy.

If all of the students (listed below) can show you that we are capable of getting our grades up, we would not like the stated policy to be enacted.

The choice is up to you however, we would still like to show you that we can get our grades up.

This policy is a great concern to me and my friends and their friends and so forth.

We have been looking forward to this all year long, we just want some time to get our grades up and to prove we can do as you say about getting the B average.

This goes for all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME.

Will you please give it a second thought and write me back in the future about your decision of the matter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME

MOST OF THE STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL (9TH-12TH GRADE)

And myself, STUDENT_NAME

THESE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO STAY AFTER SCHOOL UNTIL OUR WORK IS DONE AND TO GO OUT FOR SPORTS.
