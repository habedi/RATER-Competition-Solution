Dear Principle:

Students should have a B average or above in order to partake in sports or other activities. Student have a high tendency to put more focus into activities rather than school work. If the student does not have time for school the student doesn't have time for sports.

"Many students have a C average grade" so if those students are having trouble in school they need to put more of their effort, time, and focus into it. If the student doesn't have a B average or above then the student must be centering into sports or activities too much, which proves the students should be not be allowed to participate unless grades improve.

If a students grade decreases over time while being involved in sporting activities the student should be kicked out. The student must not be trying hard enough in school. It is the students responsibility to keep track of their grades or no more sports.
