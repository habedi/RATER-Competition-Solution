The last two years she had to attend her classes at home for college class, take online classes for her college school?. Generic_Name had to stay home and take her classes online, in Oder to finish her college class, because she is a sick person, and could not go to school like she using do in her high school years. Generic_Name had no choice but to stay home and take her classes online, the reason is she did that because

She have a sickness problem, Have her on nurse at, and only go out when the nurse is taking her somewhere or if her family going somewhere.

Firstly, She have a sickness, the reason is she is a very sick person, she can't be around people if so the person will have the sickness she have. The sickness Generic_Name have is not just a sick problem it's really danger for other people around her, even her on sister can't really be close to her, so she won't get the sickness from Generic_Name. She stay home from being sick because she don't want to get the other's sick in the school like she is right now, and suffering cause of the hard sickness she have now. It's so painful seeing her with this kind of sickness she have, she can't do anything about just wait and see if the sick will go away or is she going to live with it for the rest of her life, Generic_Name can't do anything by herself when the sickness hit her really bad. So she had to stay home when the sick come so she can control it, and don't have to get embarrass around people when the sickness hit hard on her. Generic_Name had the sickness trouble before she start staying home, because she didn't think the sick was really serious by the time she was almost done in 12th grade years, and than it become so serious for her were she couldn't control it anymore. The school and her families decide to let her take her college classes online instate of going to school everyday while she is very sick, she just stay home now take everything she needed in order for her to finish college now.

Next, Her on nurse at home, the reason is that the kind of sickness she have is require to have a nurse with her, so when she need help the nurse will be right next to her to help with some of the things needs from the nurse. The nurse is there to helps her get better, feel good, and to hill her from the sickness she have now. Generic_Name nurse is a kind person, she even help her with homework she takes online, because she use to be a teacher before she was a nurse care. Nurse Generic_Name is a great nurse for Generic_Name families like her the way she is with Generic_Name as a nurse person at home. Generic_Name had nurse Generic_Name since two years ago , while she was sick at home, every time she's going through a hard time the nurse always make her feel better. Generic_Name is so close with her nurse, they do a lot of things together like doing homework, watching a move together, and playing games. Ms. Generic_Name get pay a lot because she work harder than she needed to be work as a nurse, and she tires Generic_Name very will and help her with every step of the way or if she going through something as teenage who is growing up from a sickness problem she help her go through it, and gives her good advice about how life is . As a nurse Ms. Generic_Name spend more time taking care of Generic_Name health than her on families.

Lastly, Only go out when the nurse is taking her somewhere, or if the families going somewhere together, the reason is the sickness she have make her don't go out very often. Generic_Name only goes out when it's something important to her, while the family is going to together, or if the nurse taking her to some places. For example, she can go out with nurse ms. Generic_Name is she's going to get a check up in the hospital with her. Sometime the family decide to go in a trip or visit somewhere when there's break from school, she can choice to go or stay home because don't want to get out of the house much. It's a hard decision for her to get out of the house, because she is very sick and going through a lot of pain as a teen.

The also make her feel special and never make her feel left out of the family, because she is a nice girl to be around, Generic_Name don't get in trouble not even a bit. So her family is praying for to get better and to a good shape again cause they miss how she was before she got sick.

Finally, I think students should benefit from being able to attend to classes from home, because it's a good way for someone who is very sick or going through something. Taking class online is a great reason, but it's also not a good reason, so if someone need to take it online than they should let that person do it. If it is important to them the school should let it happened for that person to take class online. People don't want to come to school a sickness while they in class no not at all, so it's a good idea and a good opinion for that student to take classes online and at home if you are giving order from your the school, the student should be able to take it.
