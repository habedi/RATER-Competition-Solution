What do you think about this new technology "Facial Action Coding System"? Do you think it is useful or just throwing more and more money down the drain, why does a computer need to know how we are feeling? It seems cool but do we really know if there is a catch at all, like what if the government is just trying to find another way to watch us?

But who knows maybe there are some valuable things to come out of it, like a teacher would be able to see if there students are having a hard time on an online assignment, bored about to fall asleep, or even just having a bit of fun. It shows that they care and higher technology is coming! It is not that weird to think about actually because we can tell when somone is upset so what is the difference does that mean were weird or have something to hide?

A computer that knows when you're happy or sad that's awesome! The "Mona Lisa" is intended to bring a smile to our face, just imagine what a computer can do, if you smile into the Web cam to an ad you may just see more that may appear on your computer that make you happy or if you find a picture that makes you frown they'll make sure you won't see any similar pictures/ads.

The process all begans once the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That's not the last thing it also says that according to "Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion" it does't only express emotions but also may even help produce them!

Are you questioning the whole situation different now? Hopefully because it doesn't sound that bad, maybe it'll be for the better, we just have to give everything a chance.
