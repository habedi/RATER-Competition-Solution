Hello I am Luke and I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program and I am here to convice you to join it too. There are some bad things and some good things that happen when you are on board, but that is a normal day for me.

The first reason I thing you should join is we get to see all kinds of things on the boat. Like one time I got to see an excavated castle in Crete and I also marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. The reason I joined is because it is a one in a life time thing. You don't get to see castles every day or the Panama Canal.

When we drop off some of the animals we use some of there stales to play games in and we play like vollyball, and baseball, and table tennis tournaments. We also do boxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and it is a fun time on the boat.

One time when I was on one of my nine trips more then anyone I was a watchman and I was checking all the crates like I normaly do , but that night it was raining so I reported the news with the captian. Everything was good and I was coming down the ladder and I slipped down my back side and my heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide and that strip of metled saved me from falling over board. I could not work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs, but I was happy to be alive.

This opened up the world to me. I'm gratefull for this opportunity and I hope you join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is a one in a life time chance. It is a fun and exsiting thing to do because you are also helping other people. That is the biggest reason why I did it was to help people. I hope if you do join the program that you will have a good exsperiance.
