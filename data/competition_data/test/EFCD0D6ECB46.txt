Dear TEACHER_NAME

If you choose policy 1 then less kids would be getting there phones taken away and getting in trouble and less kids in trouble means more kids in class and more kids in class means higher test score which would get our school more money for new books and other things like that. Also kids are going to text anyway and if you allow them to them they wont get in trouble which is right back to the first point. If you take a lot of phones away then you might get them mixed up which means parents calling, the school having to buy new phones, a lot of school money that could buy books wasted because of all the phones being taken away. Also if you take more phones away then you might run out of space to put them. Also you cant stop kids from texting in class but if you do policy 1 then you wont have to because they will just text during there free time like in between classes.
