Greetings! I have heard that you think the Face on Mars, is a face that was created by aliens. I believe that this "face" is just a natural landform. I will support my claim why I think this, and maybe you will finally believe, that there are no such things as aliens.

There are many reasons why the Face is just a natural landform. On the second sentence paragraph, it says that we scientists have figured that the Face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only that this one had unusual shadows, which made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. The reason some people think it look like an alien, was because it looked like a real face, but it looks like a face, because the shadows formed on the rock give off illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth. On paragraph 7, it is said that Machael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the origninal Viking phots. Later on, thoughsands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appear. When it finally did, the site revealed a natural landorm. People were not satisfied, because it was a cloudy day on Mars. The scientists decided to prove that it was just a landform, so when it was not cloudy, they took another picture. In the final paragraph, paragraph 12, it says that what the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a btte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. A man name Garvin says, "That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." The lava dome is most of Middle Butte in the Snake Riber Plaint of Idaho.

So, in conclusion, if you first thought that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, than I hope I have gave your enough information, and persuaded you that it is really just a natural landform. I am sorry if you thought it was made by aliens, but it wasn't. I hope that you could understand, and see that it was just the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.
