Dear Principal,

I am aware that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. The policy that I believe to be better is the second policy you have chosen. The first policy would allow students to have their phones during free-time and time in the cafeteria, but students would have the phones in their pockets, tempting them to use the phone during class.

The second policy you chose would improve our school because students wouldn't have their phones at all, so it wouldn't tempt them to use it during class. Plus, it reduces the risk of students using their phones to cheat. Before class, students could be checked for a phone, to make sure they don't have their phones with them.

Students shouldn't have their phones in school at all because they don't need them. Their friends are at school with them, they can talk at lunch time, and their friends outside of school can wait to talk until they're out of school. Letting students have phones in school would give them a greater chance of cheating because they would be tempted to use the phone they have in their pocket.

I hope you consider my opinion on the cell phone policy change.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
