Dear principal,

I think your idea on making students have at least a grade B average to play sports is a good idea for many reasons. Doing this will motivate any sports player to do well in school. Also if students have a C in school they don't need any distractions from school because school is very important for your future career. So overall it is a very good idea and it is only to help the students in there future life. Good grades lead to a good future.

Also sports or activities are rewards. So why should we reward students that have bad grades with sports or activities. We should reward those who are doing well in school with the ability to play sports and do activities. We need to give everyone a great future life and career starting with a good education and good grades. If we don't allow those with bad grades to play sports then they can focus more on school and having higher grades and then be eligible to play sports or activities.

The schools top priority should be giving each and every student to have a great grade by educating them. Those who are getting good grades should be rewarded to show them that grades are very important. If we let students who do have bad grades play sports and there grade continues to drop that would look very bad on the schools part for rewarding its bad graded students.

Sincerely, your students
