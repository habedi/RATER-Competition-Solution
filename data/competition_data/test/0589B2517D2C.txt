In several schools have summer projects to complete during break to support learning year round and not just in school. These projects contain information from prior years to refresh the memories of students as well as useful information to know for the next school year. Like most assignments, the projects are normally designed by teachers to give to the students. While some believe it should be a student-designed assignment others thing teachers should be the ones making the work for the summer. These projects should be teacher-designed because the teachers will include all necessary information while students could leave some out, and teachers know what the students should focus on for the next year.

Teachers, on average, are much better at putting together assignment that contain all information that needs to be known then students are. This superior project building is due to the fact that teachers have much more experience with it. Almost every day, instructors put together a lesson plan to follow for class they they follow to best instruct the pupils in their class. The daily practice of putting together plans for learning allows teachers to efficiently put together in depthÂ lesson plans fast then the average student. These planning skills would allow for teachers to put together a strict and detailed program of studies for the summer. Also, teachers have a lot of experience putting together and formatting tests and quizzes of varying difficulty. Format is very important to a project for it do be easy to understand and complete; students, however, generally lack this ability to format and easy to follow set of instruction or a test with easy to understand questions. Also, many teachers teach more than one class of varying difficulty and age level, so this could help them create a test the is at a good challenge level for most people where if the students wrote the test it would drift towards the extremes. This advance experience gained from teaching gives teachers more knowledge of the future and what is best to study for future classes.

The majority of teachers know what topics will appear in future classes so they can easily put together as program to focus on topics needed for next year. Some teachers teacher both lower and higher classes so they will be able to tell the students what to know before coming to class because they teach it. Also, if they are not a first year teacher, a teacher will know what their former students did not know for the class and pass that information on to rising students to study over the summer. Secondly, teachers always talk to their fellow coworkers about what they have taught or should teach to better prepare their students for the next level. By lower teachers communicating what the students do or do not know with higher level teachers, the advanced placement teachers can compile a list of what each student should learn coming into next year. This communication is a resource that is quite difficult for students to tap in to because the teachers know the course material much better.

However, it can be argued that students should put together the test because they know their own knowledge better than the teachers do. By marking what they do know, students could make an focused, personal course to follow that is made specifically for that one student. Also, by allowing for students to make the project for themselves it would be at exactly the right difficulty level for each and every student. While these statement do hold truth they fail to contribute in that most teenagers are far less responsible than most teachers.

In conclusion, teachers should design summer projects rather than students making them because teachers understand the course better than the students and are better will including all needed information. The lack of experience and resources on the side of the students make teachers generally better at forming projects. While some think students should have more freedom on what topics they study, the teachers just understand the topics better.
