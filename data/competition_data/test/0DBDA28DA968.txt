Dear principal,

I would like to tell you that between the cell phone policies that you are reconsidering about are good and I will like you to know my opinion on which policy I would like to recommend to you. I recommend the first policy because there might be days when a student has an emergency and has to call for help or they might have a relative someplace else and they want to talk to each other. I also get that we have to turn off our phones during class to make sure that we are not texting or playing around with our phones. Instead off playing with our phones we should study and work hard in class to get a good education for our future. I also think that we should be allowed to use our phones during our free time or lunch to give us a time of our own because all day we work in every class giving everything we have to finish all our work or projects. That's all I have to say and I hope that you consider the policy I have recommended to you.
