Community service is something that is very important, just giving someone a hand can change their whole perspective on life.

The purpose of community service is to get out and make the world in which we live in a better place for everyone.

Doing something as simple as waving and asking how someone is doing can make someone's day worth while.

You will never know how much you can touch someone's heart with just a simple gesture.

It is important that everyone should do community service because it could have a positive impact on the person that is being helped as well as the person that is helping.

The feeling you get when you help someone with something is the greatest feeling in the world, there is nothing like it.

Helping an older person or being with an older person in a nursing home can be an amazing experience, you can learn about history from a standpoint of someone who was there and lived through it! That is a thing that not everyone gets to do in their life time.

Even being kind to a person that is having a bad day can make their life worth living.

If everyone would just care a little bit about each other you could save lives and the depression rate in our country could change drastically for the better.

Just think about saving someone's life, not everyone can say they have done that.

Our world has changed over the years, neighbors used to talk with each other daily just to see how they are doing, just to say hi, just to care for them.

Now all this country cares about is getting from point A to point B and in the process being rude toward others that are getting in their way.

Just think of how we could change things by just saying, " Hi, how are you?", this country could be the way it used to be.

And it wouldn't even be all that hard to do.

Community service changes lives, that is why it is important that everyone should do it more often then they care for only themselves.
