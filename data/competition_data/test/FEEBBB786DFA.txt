Dear, Principal

Community service shouldn't be required. To many kids wouldn't have the time. Its should be the child's and parents child whither the kid would or should have to do community services.

The reasons I say this is because most kids have a full schedule between school, homework, chores, church and outer family events. Many kids if they were required to do community service wouldn't go and fail or would go and not get there homework done many kids do a lot at home, and most kids wouldn't have the time.

If kids were required to go and do community serves they'd bring a negative altitude putting everyone in a bad mood. Making it miserable for the kids who actually want to be there. Many of my friends do like to do community serves they enjoy it and commit to it.

Not everyone is going to need tutoring and trash clean up, we all work together as it is to keep this community clean and safe as it is. Why put teenagers in a position in where they are not wanting to be there or are not wanted there?

This couldn't be child labor by the law since it's community service but to the teens us it would be just like it because we would be forced to work and we wouldn't be getting payed yes it would be for the community and to make out living environments a better place, but why force someone would could care less what actually happens? I know if i was forced to do community services and i dint want to id bring a negative altitude because as a kid you are forced to do things you do not like. Why add one more on.

Making children perform community service would be unfair and unreasonable to make us the teens do community service if we do not want to perform the task. I do not think you should decide to make all students perform community service it would take to much time away from homework ,sleep ,family, church ,and other important events.
