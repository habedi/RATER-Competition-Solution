To whom it may concern:

I am within the understanding that you, the principal of the school, have taken the time to ponder over the details of our fine educational establishment's policy regarding cellular devices. I have been informed that you are considering two separate policies: Policy one, which includes the usage of cellular devices at approved times throughout the day, and plan two, which prohibits all usage of devices of said nature. I would like to steer your final decision away from plan two, for reasons soon to come, and in turn bring you to the more reasonable and suitable plan number two.

Currently, our school has restricted any use of electronics, except those with the function of reading, and reading alone, such as the Kindle or the Nook. Cell phones are classified as restricted because of their tendency to divert the students attention from learning to socializing, more so then they currently do. Be that as it may, this is not the case during lunch periods or other free times, as there is no learning happening at these times. Students socialize during lunch and free periods and adding technology to this process would do nothing more than expand the social connection, which has no effects that could prove harmful to students. I, along with the vast majority of the student body find no point in removing phones from free periods, which leads many to believe that doing so is completely pointless. I understand, however, that an educational official of your caliber would not consider making such an impacting decision without a reason. Despite this, I doubt that your reasoning is good. Anytime I or a fellow classmate ask a teacher something along the lines of, "Why aren't we allowed to use our phones" (most often when we are caught with it), the answer is always returned, without fail, as, "Because they are distracting." The answer suffices, except when you apply it to free periods. Now a new question arises

- distracting from what? Not once have I witnessed a teacher answer this question and it is this lack of reasoning that frustrates students and inclines them to use their phones when they should not be, and it is also this lack of reasoning, that I build my case on. There is nothing wrong with using a cell phone during free periods, and if there is it would be in your best interest to publicize it, less you want to argue your point with no support.

In retrospect, it would be a much wiser decision to endorse plan number one because of the sheer difference in supportive reasoning between the two. Many would prefer the inauguration of a plan with benefits rather than the continuation of a nonsensical plan such as the one currently in use.

With truth and reconciliation,
