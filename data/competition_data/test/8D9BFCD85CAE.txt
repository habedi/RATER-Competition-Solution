Dear Principle,

I have been informed that you are a bit shaky on the decision to make community service a requirement to the student body or not. Well, I believe that it would be a splendid opportunity for the students to assist people and really just feel the joy of helping others. Also i think it would help students stay on the right track in their lives and not get dragged into drama and all the non since that goes on in schools these days. Plus i bet that the students will come to like the fact that they are really making a difference in our community. Think about it this way, the students of your school being on the front cover of the newspaper for cleaning up the beach. They could also volunteer at a nursing home and just help the older people around, talk to them, and just make them feel loved. I mean if i was in an older folks home and i didn't get visited very often and these really happy, smiley children came to visit me it would totally make my day. I really believe with all my knowledge that this idea of yours is going to be very beneficial to the community and to your student body!

Sincerely,
