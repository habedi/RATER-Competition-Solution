The Challenges that we have in our world of tecnology is that some of it is not good enough and that is ok because we are getting better. The challenges we face trying to go to Venus is that there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97% Carbon Dioxide is covering it in like a blanket which is very hard to get through. According to the author, " Often referred to as Earth's (twin,) Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." It would be nice to have another planet to go to in case of this one had gotten distroyed or in like population. We have faced many challenges in our technology now that trying to go to another planet like Venus in paticular, maybe in the future we could live there but not now, It would be nice to have another planet to go to if there was something bad to have happen to our planet now or maybe if we got to crowded in this world with the population.

The challenges we face trying to go there is that its is the second planet from the sun so it would be hot. Our technology is not good right now but soon it will be good enough to have successfully landed on Venus. The seasons like on Earth are months but on venus it might not be. Not a single spacecraft has landed or has survived a landing which is very scary. It has said in the article, that not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus for more that three decades. This is one of the challenging planets but soon in the end when we figure it out and we will celebrate. Also on our planets surface temperatures averages over 800 degrees Farenheit, but Venus atmospheric pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experience now on our own planet! There is no way that if our technology cant make it then there is no way that we are. Not even a second.

We cannot live there for so many reasons but soon we will have been able to figure it out successfuly landed on Venus. There is reasons why we cannot live there and here is some reasons why. Venus is the hottest planet and its the second planet from the sun. Mercery is the planet that is the closest to the sun but Venus is the second but yet it is the hottest. Its very hot but we probably would have no season because the Venus spins an orbits around us alot faster than we do. The carbon dioxide, acid, and even gas is scary poisons that can kill us in seconds. Also that we would have to worry about if we did go there. If none of our spaceships can go there and not survive then we are more than likely not to have survived by the time we reach the outer layer.

It would be nice to live there but there are so much bad that could happen to us. If we were to have figured it out then we are more and likely to surive if we could also figure out what we can do to keep us alive like maybe have a space suit on the whole time. We could totally go to one planet and have a greater chance of living then to be stuck on one and be trapped. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well be the only chance that we have. It is almost Earth-like planet in our solar system alone. Venus was probably once covered in largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Venus has a surface of rockey sefiment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountins, and even craters. Venus is also the nearest option for planetary visit, but the crucial visit of space travel to get some people there is going to take awhile. Is it an identical twin to us and it is the closests to size and even density.

It would be a good place to go and seek shelter if our world would have gotten distroyed. In the long run it would be really good to figure it out and actually have a spacecraft successfully land. There are its challenges but we as humans do not give up until we find the answers. We will have eventually be on Venus but it will take a long time considering that it has taken 3 decades and it might be longer to have sent out a spacecraft and it succesfully land. The reasons why we can't live there is many of reasons but we will soon fine out ways. Even NASA has an idea of what could work. It might be a really dumb way but in the end if it does work then we will have successfully be on Venus. Even if we are floating blimp like around 30 or so miles about the roiling Venusial landscape.
