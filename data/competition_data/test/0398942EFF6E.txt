Dear Principal,

I think you should put Policy 1 because no one is really bothering other people with their phones. Its the students responsibility if they loose their phone or if someone steals it. In addition, it depends on the student if they want to take advantage of their education or not. They are the ones who choose their future. So if their phone is a distraction for them for their education, then they should do something about it. During lunch periods, its all about free time from school, so they should use their phones. Also, if you put Policy 2, students would have to use them in case of an emergency. Furthermore, if you put Policy 1, then the students won't have to "want" to take their phones out during class because they can take their phones out during lunch periods and other free times. In simpler terms, the students would turn off their phones during class because they can use them in their free time during school. If you put Policy 2, then the students would continue to use their phones during class.
