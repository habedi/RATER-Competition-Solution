Dear TEACHER_NAME

I am writing to you to discuss the matter of whether students should or shouldn't do service in the community for school purposes. From what I have observed over the last couple days is that doing service in the community is a great way to build happiness, generosity, and love. Personally, I think everyone deserves to be happy in our community. By doing service our school will be helping out people who need it. We will be spreading happiness throughout our community. It's like a chain re-action, if one person gives happiness to someone then that person will spread happiness to another person and it just keeps going on until everyone is happy.

Students should have to do at least 3 units of service each quarter. A unit of service is where the student decides how much of there time they want to give up to someone who needs it? However much time you give will help. Every inch of service always counts. Like if we delivered food from the OTHER_NAME house to people who don't have enough money to buy food, those people would be so unbelievably grateful! These are only some of the reasons that our school should do service for the community. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
