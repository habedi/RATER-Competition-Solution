To whom it may concern,

Requiring at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities is wrong. Students can express themselves more freely if their life isn't just about schoolwork. Sometimes all a student needs is to take the pressure out of school or family by sports or other activities. Maybe a student has a C average even after you take away sports and any other activity.

Sports can also help someone get into shape. They allow us to exercise in a fun way. Also, it's not required to take, which takes the pressure of a grade away. Sports can also help us make new friends and may even provide us with a choice of a career. Either way, sports can benefit you and should not be requiring a certain grade average.

Other activities, like dance, cheer-leading, or photographer, can also benefit people. Some activities like dance can help us stay active while photography can help us socially. These activities give us a chance to hang out with friends and express ourselves in creative ways. Activities should also not be required by a certain grade average because they help us express ourselves in different ways.

Also, if the students feel strongly about their sport or activity, they might cheat to get the grade required for them to get back in. It might pressure them even more if you tell them they need a certain average. Taking away their activities and sports may also make them do worse in school because they are stressed out about grades.

These reasons show why I am against making students have a certain average to do sports or activities. Not letting students participate in activities and sports may stress they out. They will be less active and maybe even less social. You should not take aw
