Dear Principal,

I think the policy in which cell phones are allowed during free time is better than no cell phones at all. Even if you banned cell phones it wouldn't stop kids from bringing them to school. Kids like to keep in touch, which is why they have cell phones. Since they can't talk in class texting is more sneaky than writhing paper notes and throwing them around the classroom where the teachers are watching.

Its also a good time to call parents in free time if they are staying after school of they are riding home with a friend's parent. It feels less tense than asking a teacher to use your cell phone or using the school's phone. If kids are allowed to have their cell phones during free time there may be a chance they won't use their cell phone in class in return. Besides, if they aren't allowed to use their cell phones in school there is a chance they would use it in class and look cool doing it. It would just get other people trying to do it too. And if you are going to let cell phones in school, you have to enforce the rules better than with the 'no cell phones' rule. Give a big consequence if they decide to go against the rules, Like a lunch or an after school detention. Or maybe get their cell phone taken away and they can only get it back after class or school. Also you could probably send it to you, the principal's office where the can get it after school or by rules have a parent pick up the phone. If you enforce this rule you could make all the students sign a contract that they will only use their cell phones during lunch or free time or else they may have to face consequences such as the ones mentioned before. Tell them that this is not a freedom but a privilege.

I think you should allow cell phones to be in school but just at lunch or a free time. That way everyone gets what they want. Kids actually get the opportunity to actually use cell phones at school. If kids get more freedom, so do you. I think you will be very surprised how many students will agree and respect this rule. Kids want to use their cell phones so I'm pretty sure no one will be breaking this policy. You, the principal can be rest assured that kids are using their cell phones at a free time but not in class. And if there were anything to happen with this rule you can always have the right to remove this rule and ban cell phones in school once and for all.

Thank you,
