schools should let the teachers decide their summer projects. schools should let teachers do this because, the student bodies would learn more, also it would be on track with next years corricilam. and it would make students do the project.

The student bodies would learn more from their teachers picking the project. The teacher would pick the project on education that the kids need to learn. Also they would learn more because it would be structured and organized well. Teachers would make the projects fun, so the kids would want to do the project over the summer break and learn. Furthermore it would get them ready for the grade theyre going into.

Another reason teachers should pick the students projects for over summer break. Is that it would also be on track with next years corricaliam. So for the kids that want to study and know what they are gonna be learning next year, can have it all to prepare for their classes next year . It would help the kids and teachers learn how the kids are doing in different subjects. So when they come in on the first day the teachers can see where they are with their classes the teachers can see the areas where they are struggling.

The third reason is if a teacher designed the project then the students would do the project. The students would do the project if the teachers designed more than they would if the students had to design the project. The teachers projects would be more on topic the the students projects. Also the teachers would have deadlines in when you need to have certain areas or subjects done to keep student on track and learning. If the students designed the projects they would never learn, because they would pick the easiest projects to do the teachers would pick what they needed to learn and it would be structured and the students would be able to focus on the project better.

In conclusion teachers would be the best at designing the project because the kids would learn more then if the students designed the project. Also it would have all the lessons they need for the next years classes and it would make the students focus on the project more and learn more during the summer. Futhermore kids would learn better if teachers gave the summer projects.
