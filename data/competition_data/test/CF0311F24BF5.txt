Dear principle,

I really think this unfair to many students who try there best in school.

Students that have a "C" or above should be able to participate in sports . I think that having a "C" or above is average and that having a "D" or lower should not participate in sports because it is not passing the standard's . People who have "C" s and higher should be aloud to play sports because they are meeting the standards of the school . This new rule is not very helpful at keeping students fit because they are not aloud to do any sports because they have a "C" in there classes . If students with a grade of "C" were aloud to participate in sports then they would be more fit and know how to keep them self's healthy. They would also be trained to pay more attention in class because they have to pay a lot of attention when they are playing sports. Students with a grade of "C" may also not be very good at something they are learning and that could bring there grade down .If the student with a grade of "C" really wanted to play sports then he would have to try to do better but in school although he might be giving his 100%. Students that don't have any extra curricular activities could also became part of a gang give in to drugs and do many unhealthy things for there body and brains . This is why i think they should change the new policy they have made . Please keep in mind this letter because people who have "C" s may be trying there best in his/her class.

Sincerely, a student
