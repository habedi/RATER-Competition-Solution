Limiting car ussage lowers the polution rates. A quote from lisabeth Rosenthal's passge "

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

", "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Many people can go without personal cars and making smarter ways for transportation such as a bike, a bus, or carpooling with a friend to get to their destonation. A statment from the passage "

Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog ." "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifting smog..." Meaning less cars make the road safer by limiting the number of cars allowed to drive on that certain day.

Places are banning cars on the roads on certain days to limit the number of drivers and limiting the amout of polution. From the passage "

In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars ." it states "Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning."" By telling drivers they can only drive on certain days helps the environment and cutes back on smog and accidents.

The United States is also joining in on the "smart planning" movement by cutting back on the number of drivings on the road and number of cars owned by people. More people are taking the bus now rather than wasting and polution their gasoline. More people everywhere are taking bikes, walking, and carpooling with a friend to save money and gas. We now have electric cars where we can charge our cars in an outlet rather than filling up the tank with gasoilne.

It is better for you to walk or ride a bike to your destionation its smarter too. If you ride your bike, walk, take the bus, or carpool with a friend you are impaction greatly on the environment by reducing accidents and limiting smog. You can also save money on not taking your car everyday to work or school, taking the bus or carpooling can do alot.
