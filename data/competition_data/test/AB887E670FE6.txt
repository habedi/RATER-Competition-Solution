Dear principal,

You should do policy number two because if you do not allow students to have phones at all during school things will become easier.

Cell phone use is making the learning process more difficult for the teachers.

The students are texting during class.

Making them not pay attention.

The ring tone of the phone goes off during class it will disrupt the class. Students wont be able to do their homework because they will either be talking or texting on their cell phones.

When they are given a reading assignment the are talking on their cell phones.

If students use their cell phones all the time they wont be able to learn.

If you chose policy number one it will be frustrating for the teacher to teach class.

The kids will be sneaking their cell phones putting them on silent and hide them behind their books or every time the teacher turns around they hide it in their pockets.

Teenagers today are already abscessed with their cell phones so if you let them use their cell phones their grades will go down.

They use their phones for most of the day. If you let them use their phones at school they will probably use it every morning before school, in library, in class, in the bathroom, and in the after noon.

That is why you should pick policy number two.
