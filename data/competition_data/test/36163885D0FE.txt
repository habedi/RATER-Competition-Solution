A facial action coding system sounds very confusing. A software that can detect emotions. Could this be useful in the classroom? I say not yet. I think it could be valuable but not now because it is not devopled well enough yet.

The value of a teacher being right in front of you is not matchable. Many people learn different ways and a lot of them like a teacher teaching them instead of a computer. Kids, like myself, learn better when a teacher is making sure you stay on task. The idea of a computer being able to change its lesson based on your face and emotions sounds cool in theory but sadly the computer will not be able to keep the student on track and focused on school work.

Another issue with this technology is it has not been tested futher them just on a painting according to the article. The facial system needs to be tested further until they plan on rolling it out to online schools to be used in. So far all we know is it can detect a face on a painting very well but we do not know how well it would work on a student. The program could even read the students face wrong even if the student did not want that to happen. That could cause huge problems for the student when they like a lesson but the program read their face poorly and it changed the lesson.

In conclusion I think the technology is certainly cool and could seem usefull but I do not think they have researched about other uses as much as they could. Once the technology is perfected then it could be used in online classrooms but I do not see the uses for in a regular school yet.
