Yes, all students should perform community service to clean the community and to make it less dangerous and polluted. If the community was to be cleaned more, we would have more fresh and less dangerous air. If we made the community to stop being dangerous less people would die. There are many criminals out that the police have not found out about yet.

If many people would volunteer, other people that already have jobs would not need to or be forced to get a job someone already has. By volunteering, people that need jobs could help the community by picking up trash or helping serve food at special occasions.

Volunteering would get people into being active instead of watching tv all day.

The people who would volunteer could meet nicer people and have them help out with more community problems that other people would need help with in the world. Volunteers could help with supporting people by earning money for homeless.
