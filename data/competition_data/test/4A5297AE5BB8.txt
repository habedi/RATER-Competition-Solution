You are smile, but you only 80 percent happy, 15 percent board and 5 percent angry. Do you now how can i calculate you emotions? I use the some new computer software that can recognize emotions. that sounds really cool. and i think that technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a claaroom is valuable.

If a classroom computer could recognize students emotional. That will be really helpful for the class and for the student and teacher. Becasue if when student use the computer play video games or watch the video, the computer recongnize they are doing that, so that computer will tell the teacher, and the teacher will coming to stop what are you doing now, and then you will listen the class careful.

And if you during the class you becoming bored, the computer recongize that and will tell teacher that and if a lot of student being bored, the teacher will try to know why lot of student in his class is bored and the teacher will change that, make the class more fun for the student, that is a really good things for the student. When you during the class you fell something not understand,the computer will recognize that and tell the teacher, the teacher will coming to help you let you understand that, that software is reallt helpful during the class.

That is a really good software for the class room that is very useful. so that technology to read the emotioal expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.
