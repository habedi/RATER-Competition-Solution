Dear Principal,

I don't think that in order to do sports, you have to have a B grade average. Many students only have a C grade average, so many students that would like to participate in sports can not. I believe that it is highly unfair to make this a policy. Many students might not be able to get a B average for a reason, such as problems at home. They might have a disability and that inter fears with their school work and grades.

Some one might be Hypoglisimic, and when they don't eat, they don't function right, and they don't even know they are Hypoglisimic. So when their grade averages out, they have a C because of their condition.

You need to open your eyes and realize that there are people that can't help that they might have a reason for not doing so well in school. i do believe, however, that they do need a certain grade average. I just believe that it should stay at a C, but for the semester, they can have no more than two F' s on their report card and must have a physical done and completed before the tryout's. At least that way not only do they get to try out if they meet my suggested requirements, they can also try something new, or follow their dreams.

For me, I love playing Volleyball, and it is just so much fun for me and it makes me happy, but I am Hypoglisimic, and I also have low blood sugar, and that was affecting me in school. I had a C in my Language Arts class, because I was so hungry and couldn't concentrate properly. If the grades came out, I would have a C average, and wouldn't have been able to try out for Volleyball. And if I still didn't get my grade up by the time Track was going to start, I wouldn't be able to tryout then either. All because I was, and still am, Hypoglisimic.

Many people have a disability and don't even know it and it affects them in school. Many people also like or love to do sports, such as Volleyball, Track, Basketball, Football, etc., and they wont be able to tryout all because they have a C grade average, and it might be because they have a disability, and because of that, the sports and other activities are taken away from them.

Sometimes students have poor grades that give them a C grade average because it is the teachers fault. I say this from my own experience. I was out for a week and two days because i was very sick, and it took my Language Arts teacher several days to get my makeup work packet put together, and it wasn't because there was so much, she just wouldn't do it. My mother went down there and heard from the councilor herself. And the thing that happened with that same teacher, is that for that week and two days, she only gave me part of the packet, so i had a bunch of things still missing and it was from when i was out. We had an in class test that was done on the laptops she has in the class, and she never told me about it, and she wasn't putting in grades for papers that she graded herself and gave back to me. So for the first semester, i was failing her class or barley getting a C. So I had a C average for my actual grade.

It is not always the students fault for their grades, sometimes the teachers are just as much at fault. That, or it might just be the computers not getting the grades in when the teachers enter them. There are many reasons why a student, or many, would have a C grade average.

I don't believe you should make a policy to have students have a B grade average to participate in sports and other activities in school. There is people with disabilities, teachers not putting in grades, or the computer wont take them. If grades are put into the computer and the computer wont take them, then the entire grade gets messed up. The requirements I had listed before, I hope you take them into consideration before making your final decision.

Sincerely,
