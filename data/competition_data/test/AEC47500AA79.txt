Its not right for them to make us only have a grade B average for us to do any sports. a lot of kids work really hard on getting those grade C average and if you move it up to a B average people may just quite doing the sport they where in and not care about there grades and start getting an D average. People need stuff to motivate them in to doing what they love but if you start setting the standards too high they will feal pressured and just quit. we get enough pressure from are parents, friends, loved ones and from everyday life we don't need extra weight on are shoulders.

and what if you work really hard in all of your grades but you just slip in one subject and your grade turns out to be a C but all the rest of your grades are an B or above and just because of that one little grade you cant participate in that sport just because you got an C.

I can understand if you get a 60 in one subject and you cant participate in that sport because of that, it makes since because your failing and if you keep failing then you may have to repeat that grade and that's not good plus it looks bad on an collage application. But, a 70 is still passing and they shouldn't kick you out just for that.

I know that the schools are just probably trying to boast there grade averages but it may be less pressure on you but more on the students so don't take away the one thing that brings joy to the people, you can find another way to boast grades by not taking away anything.
