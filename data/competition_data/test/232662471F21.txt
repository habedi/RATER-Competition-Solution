One's feelings should not be used as some sience experiment. There are many people in the world who have feelings that they hide for persnal reasons, and for someone to get in someone else's head is not right. Emotions should not be calculated because it is an invasion of personal feelings, inner thoughts, and emotional expressions.

People have personal feelings that they dont want shared with everyone. In the article the author introduces a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to recognize human emotions. However, this is a complete invasion of personal feelings because everybody has the right to a closed mind. The author has also said that, "...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." Sometimes that's not always the case because people have inner thoughts as well tht they hide.

Another reason why emotions should not be calculated is because people have inner thoughts that they dont want shared as well. Through paragraph 5 it shows how people can see what other people are thinking based on their facial experessions, but that is not always true because some people hide their inner thoughts for the sake of others opinions and feelings. Inner thoughts should stay inner thoughts until the person thinking them is ready to share how they feel. The passage explains how most communication is non verbal, inlcluding emotional commmunication. Furthermore, this proves that if people cannot see certain emotions someone portrays to them than that someone doesnt want those emotions to be shown because it isnt that hard to pick certain emotions out by the way one is looking at you.

Lastly, people's emotions should not be calculated becasue it exposes their emotional expression. This article shows that people have a lot of expression and it can be determined with this Facial Coding machinery. People sometimes express emotions only to help another persons inner feelings. Using what the author has told about this system, for somebody to take a computer and actually go in your head to see what your actually feelings could not only expose yor emotional expression, but hurt someone else's feelings as well.

The invasion of personal feelings, inner thoughts, and emotional expression prove that emotions should not be calculated. People have the right to privacy, even if its only the mind, and this system reveals their secret emotions that should not have to be revealed through test.
