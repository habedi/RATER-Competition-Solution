Imagine having a car that drives itself. Not having yourself put your foot on the accelerator or even the break. Having the car steer itself also. Seems too unreal right? Having cars that drive them selves seems like a whole big mess. People these days are getting to lazy to get into a car and drive it yourself. My position on driverless cars are that I am against it. These cars should not be developed for humans.

These driverless cars of the "future" are not truly driverless. According to the text, there still has to be a driver in the car to drive it in situations like: pulling in and out of driveways, dealing with complicated traffic issues, and navigating through roadwork or accidents. Even though the car can steer, accelerate, and brake without the driver doing it. The car still needs to keep the human alert of such things like going around accidents or driving through zone work. The future generation of teens will not know how to drive a car properly with these new driverless cars. What kind of person would want a driverless car that still needs the help of a driver? According to Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, he says " We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way." The manufacturers want to have in-car entertainment. Driving should not be fun, it should taken more serious and with more caution. These in-car entertainment would be to distracting for the driver. Many new technology has had malfuntions. These new cars could break down, or even not let the human driver take over when it has to.

My position on driverless cars is that I am against it. Having a car that does all the work for you does not seem like a good idea. These cars should not be developed for humans to drive. The driverless cars seem too dangerous and to difficult to handle.
