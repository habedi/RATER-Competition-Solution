To the Principal:

Everyone loves to use the cell phone. Because it can connect us. We can talk to our friends. But now, a lot of students bring their cell phone to school. Some of them use the cell phone in the class. It was noisy. It makes students can't study.

So, I think you can't allow the student bring their cell phone at all. Because now, we can play the games, watch the video and listen the music, if the student bring the cell phone, they always play the cell phone and not study. The school is for studying, not for playing. And some student maybe will take away their cell phone. That is bad for the students.

Third, some students doesn't have money to buy the cell phone. It will makes they feel bad. And it maybe will makes the students buy the expensive cell phone to bring to school. I don't think it is good for the students.

If the student just play the cell phones. They aren't talk to anyone. They are not to make some friends. It just will make the students become cool and not like to make friends. Of course, we have to use the cell phone in the life. I think Principal can put some phone in the school. Let the student bring the money to use the phone will be better. Thank you for you spend time to read my letter.
