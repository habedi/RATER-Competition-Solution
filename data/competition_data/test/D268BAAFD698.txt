Dear principal,

I believe that students should have the right to participate in sports or other activities with a grade C average. That wrong to the student with a learning disability who are try hard to do well in school, and can maintain a grade C average. They might want to play sports. My opinion is that the students who do not try in school and have a bad behavior are the ones who should not play. They can maintain a grade B average, but they are hard to work with and rude to other students and/or adults. As principal, you probably know who those students are.

Some kids at school try harder than others to do right and get good grades, but their work always equal up to a C . It is unfair for those types of students to not try out for a sport they want because they can not get a high enough grade. They should have the privilege of being in sport or any other activities.

My opinion is that as principal you should not allow students with rude attitudes to play sports, even if the have a grade A average. Those are the students who should be punished. Lots of students a grade B or higher average think hey can stop doing work after time passes, while students with a lower grade still try.

You might believe that students with a grade higher than a C are the hardest workers, but a lot them is not. As a matter of fact, some of them prove to be the worst. Not all students with a grade of C or lower are bad students. So the ones that are good should be rewarded. It is only fair for them to be on sport teams or any other activities.

Some of the C average students are hoping that you change your mind. Can you please just punish the people who deserve to be punished. That is all that they ask
