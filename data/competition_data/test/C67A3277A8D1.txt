Many people use cars to get from one place to another,but however, many states around the world are having people not using cars. In other words, many states are car free states and this has changed many cultural changes in the sociey that the people live in. Not using any cars provides many beneficial factors to not only the enviroment but to the people too and here's why. Having car-free states reduces car emission and can provide healthier productive lives of exercise. This change to the world can inspire lots of people and open up the doors of nature's beauty to provide a peaceful way of living to the enviroment of the world.

We use cars everyday in our lives from going to resteraunts, jobs, homes, schools,ect. However, do we ever think that whenever we drive we are causing more pollution to spread from every mile we go? Cars are the number one leading pollution emission enviroment destroyers in the world. This pollution causes many close suburban areas with homes around to breathe in gas emission from cars. This is absolutely not healthy at all to many people. For example, in the article written by Robert Duffer in his title, "Paris bans driving due to smog." States that, "[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter (PM) per cubic meter..." That is more toxin to inhale that could possibly kill you! There are countries, for instance, like Germany that have some cities "car-free" as an experimental way to stop pollution emission and traffic jams causing loud noises to some close spaced suburban areas. Now, instead of using cars the people living in Germany are walking, riding bikes, or using trams to get from one place to another. So far, the people do not mind having any cars around and they even say they are happy and like the new change on where they live. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," says Heidrun Walter from the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, "Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." So whenever you first sit in a car think about what you are about to do and think about how you can benefit yourself and the world by not spreading pollution emission from cars.

Many people want to exercise, stay fit, and lose weight depending on what they want to do. Some people like to jog or run to go to there jobs as a productive way to not use there cars but to get out and exercise more. Many people around the world perfer not to use cars but instead use any-other means of transportation to either make themselves healthy or to not use any means of spreading pollution. In fact many people that live in big cities such as New York and San Francisco with more cars driving in the population. Have young people from 16-39 year olds that don't have a drivers license use other means of transportation to benefit themselves. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, "The End of Car Culture." States that, "They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends." People ages from 16-39 year olds are not caring about using cars or getting a drivers license but using any other means of transportation even if it is longer way to get to a destination. This is very beneficial for young people of 16-39 year olds to have healthy lives at a young age so they can live longer and they can feel good about themselves.

Can you see now why having no cars as the means of transportation is a good thing? Many people are having healthier lives and live on not using pollution but using other means of transportation. People in many states and countries are happy with this change for the better as new meaning of change in cultural experiences. Now, are you able to change just like the people living the "car-free" life around the world?
