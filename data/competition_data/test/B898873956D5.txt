Having cars is great for getting around efficiently but ther are some down sides to driving motor vehicles.  Some reasons are the way it affects our atmosphere and how it decreases our phisical activity.  This is why we need to cut back on driving motor vehicles.

My first reason is the way driving affects the atmosphere.  In Paris the government enforced rules stating that "motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine."  This is because the cars were emitting smog which is a gas that lingers in the air polluting it.  The smog was getting worse than Bejing, China "one of the most polluted cities in the world."

The second reason we need to cut back on driving motor vehicles is it is limiting our phisical activity.  In Bogota, Colombia they started a movement "a day without cars."  the were fining everybody with the exceptions of buses and taxis.  On this day a lot of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on this day.  "Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic."  Some effects of this movement were straight paved sidewalks and sports centers for people to enjoy.

In conclusion, if we cut back on driving motor vehicles we will have cleaner air and no smog and we will get more phisical activity by using other methods of getting around instead of using a motor vehicle.
