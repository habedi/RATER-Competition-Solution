Would giving a person the opportunity to create something benefit them in the future? Throughout a person's school life what they are allowed to work on is continuously dictated by the teachers and school's administration. One major aspect of school that is dictated by the teachers is the summer projects students are required to complete. By the summer project being a teacher created assignment, there are quite a few restrictions as to what the student is capable of doing. Due to this, the summer project should be a student-designed project in order to stimulate greater interest, allow more flexibility, and increase the responsibility of the student.

The first reason that the summer project should be a student-designed project is because it would stimulate greater interest into what they are able to work on. An example of this would be a student's yearly science fair project. By granting students the ability to control what they researcher their interest and desire to complete the project is increased. With increased interest also comes a higher possibility that the work done by the student will be completed on time as well as not be plagiarized. Not only will it motivate students to want to perform well while also putting in the effort that is required to pass, but it will also make it an enjoyable task to complete.

The next reason that summer projects should be student-designed is because it would provide more flexibility. This would be seen by allowing students the chance to set their own limits and/or restrictions.

Being able to set their own restrictions make it to where the students can finish the project more efficiently. Increased flexibility would also grant the student the opportunity to create their own work schedule. More control over their scheduling will help decrease the possibilities of being stressed and overworked, it could also present the opportunity to students to work alongside one of their peers in order to complete their chosen assignment. Most of all more flexibility could have a direct correlation to how enjoyable the completion of their assignment would be.

The third, and final, reason thatÂ students should design their own summer project is because it could increase the responsibility of the student. Many people argue that, during their school age, students require more guidance and are not capable of making their own decisions. By continuously imposing rules and restrictions on students they become incapable of maneuvering through assignments on their own. With that become unable to learn the best way for them to be able to complete assignments. Giving students the responsibility that they deserve and need will aid them in the future. When it comes to college, it could help them with working on different task on their own and coming up with efficient ways of completing said task. While in the work force, it will aid them in cognitive thinking and the ability to think on their own and not have to depend on their coworkers for the answers.

In order to stimulate greater interest, allow more flexibility, and increase the responsibility of the student, the summer project should be student-designed. Allowing students to design the summer project will not only benefit them, but the teachers as well. Both sides would gain from the encounter and will likely be able to use the information from the experience for future references. Most of all this could provide students with some clarity as to how the real world functions and the choices they may be required to make some day.
