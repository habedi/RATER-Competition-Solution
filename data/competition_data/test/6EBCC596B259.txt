Sometimes you need to go somewhere but just don't feel like driving. Or maybe you are going on a vacation but don't like to fly so instead you drive. Driving for hours at a time is no fun at all. That's why they've come up with the solution to that problem, driverless cars! You may only need to drive when the roads get bad, there is roadwork going on, or when you have came across an accident. This makes life much easier! Now you can relax, and not worry about the road near as much as you would be if you were driving the whole way.

Another problem with the cars we have today is the gas mileage. Most of the cars we have today have terrible gas mileage. With gas prices being around $2 or more you want to use the least amount of gas that you can. WIth driverless cars you may only use half of the gas that you've been using. Can you imagine that? If you get 20 miles to the gallon you may now get up to 40 miles per gallon! The article says," The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's...". If you're the person that doesn't like to fly but wants to go on vacation this car may be the best thing to take for the drive. Because you wouldn't use near as much gas as you originally would. And as I said before with gas prices how they are today, you want to save as much as you can!

Maybe you aren't going on a vacation but you choose not to drive and take the bus to work instead. If you work morning shift trying to load a bus with hundreds of other people around 4 or 5 in the morning is not fun. Not to mention there usually aren't enough seats so you may be left standing the whole ride to work. That doesn't make a very good start to your day. The owners of the bus(es) could have some driverless cars as well. Driverless cars would have way more flexibility than a bus or even a taxi. They may also even have more flexibility than most cars that we use today. The articles says," Offer far more flexibility...". This shows that driverless cars offer more flexibility than a regular car, bus or taxi. That means, that you day may not be ruined because you had to stand the whole ride to your job.

Another great thing about these driverless cars is that they don't take on more then they can handle. They alert the driver before they need to take over the wheel. Because, of course driverless cars can't do everything that us humans can do. So if you come across some roadwork or an accident your car may alert you that you need to take over until you get passed that. This isn't such a bad thing though. It's much better to have to take over the wheel then it is to crash because the car took on more then it could handle. The article says," They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues...". So the only time you'd have to drive is when your car feels its better for your safety if you take over the wheel.

The last great thing I'm going to tell you about driverless cars is that they give you plenty of warnings before you have to drive. Some people are saying that it would be boring to just sit there and wait for your turn to drive. But they are working on putting systems in the cars to where they can entertain you. However, the entertainment will shut off as soon as its your turn to drive again. The article says," Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be shut off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to a driver trying to text with a cell phone. So, you can be entertained but you can also be warned before you have to drive that way everyone is still safe!

In conclusion, driverless cars can be a great thing for us! They use half of the fuel that today's cars use. They have way more flexibility the today's buses, taxis, and even some cars. They don't take on more they can handle, instead they tell the driver to take over. Lastly, they entertain you but shut the entertainment off when it's your turn to drive so everyone is safe. So, driverless cars can be a great thing for us!
