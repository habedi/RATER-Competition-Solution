In many places, people drive cars. We know that driving a vehicle can lead to all kinds of pollution because of the fuel we use to power them. Because of this reason, people have decided to stop driving their cars, or take time off from driving them. Places such as Germany, America, and even Paris, France, have stopped using their vehicles as frequently.

In Vaubun, Germany, many have given up their cars and have deicded to walk to where they need to go. Their streets are completely "car free", except where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and some streets on one edge of the community. You are allowed to own a car, but you can only park at the edge of a development, but you have to buy a space for $40,000, along with your home. for this reason, 70 percent of the population does not own a car and 57 percent sold their car to move to Vaubun. Some families say they're much happier wtihout a car.

In Paris, France, a partial driving ban has been enforced. On some days, motorists with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or they would suffer a fine. Then the next day this would apply to people with an odd numbered car. Almost 4,000 people where fined and twenty-seven people had their cars impounded. This ban was enforced because of the amount of smog that is in Paris.

Pollution is a very bad issue, and people driving cars do not help at all. All of the driving is very bad and it needs to be stopped. Programs which stop people from driving cars is very helpful. The partial bans on cars and banning them completely will definetly help the world, the air, and humans too!
