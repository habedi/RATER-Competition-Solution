Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i do not agree with you about having at least a B average to play a sport.

I believe that students should at least have a C average because the sports they have keep them healthy and fit.

If you made it the way you want it, the students could end up obese or their grades might drop.

If they are to have at least a C average, they are still getting good grades and doing their homework.

Students rely on their sports to stay healthy and even though their grade are not a B average, but they are still trying and getting the work done.

I am going to be in three different types of sports in one year, cheering, color guard and volley ball. So as you see i also rely on sports but not only because they keep me fit and healthy but because i enjoy doing them.

Students all around the world are in different sports and even thought they might not have the best grades, you know that they are having fun and they enjoy doing what they do; But if you take their sports away, what are they suppose to do on their free time?

There might even be a lot more fighting and arguments because of all the free time on their hands.

If they already do their studying in a regular basis, are they suppose to just sit on the couch, eat food and watch television? Here that's what we call being lazy.

Students should have fun and its good for them to socialize.

If they are in sports, that could be a possible scholarship, even if they have a C average. You can see there progress in their school work if you let do their sports. A healthy body equals a healthy mind.

You shouldn't pressure students into doing their work and getting good grade because those students' grades can begin to decline and they might even transfer school to do what they love, I would.

Students need that endurance and a lot of strength to go through the rest of their life. So please listen to me, keep it at a C average and let students work up to a B average.

They would really appreciate that.

Like I said, students need and love their sports.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
