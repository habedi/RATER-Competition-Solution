The landform on Mars that looks like a face may seem like a momument created by aliens to some people, but it is actually just a mesa, which was uncovered by NASA's cameras on a cloudy day. An ancient alien civilization seems more than possible to some, but while it is a possibility, the landform on Mars is not an ancient civilization. Evidence of this is found on the image directly before the article, which shows the landform over time. More recent cameras have a better quality of capturing photos than previous ones, which is why NASA photographed the landform at different years. The landform on Mars is just a mesa, because it resembles natural rock formations on Earth and there is photo proof of it.

The face on Mars is just a mesa, because according to the article, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa -- landforms common around the American West." The article later states that the Martian landform resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho, which is a lava dome. The Martian landform is clearly a natural mesa, not an ancient civilization created by aliens, since it resembles occurances that are common in Earth's natural structure.

The Martian landform is a natural occuring rock formation, since there is photo proof of it and it looks identical to mesas, buttles, and lava domes on Earth. An ancient alien civilization may seem possible to some, and impossible to others, but the face on Mars is just a rock structure that is natural to the Martian landscape. All in all, the "alien civilization" is not an alien civilization after all, and is instead, a Martian mesa.
