Dear Principal,

I agree with policy 1 because you can interact with your peers more and talk about hanging out after school or talk about something private. I agree with number 1 again because if your having a bad day let that friend know by texting them. I also agree with them being turned off because people could cheat on tests and stuff, but if someone comes to the school with a gun you have your phone to call the police or your parents for help.

Like our school we have to have them off all day until we get outside, when most people have them on anyway. If you get caught with your hone here they take it for two school days then your parents have to come and get it. I think we should be able to have our phones during school hours in study halls or free time because we can get to know our peers more, which is good for our social life, so your don't die alone or go being depressed.

I hope you read this letter and enjoyed this letter. Thank you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
