I believe that use of the Facial Action Coding System could make immediate impacts in a classroom setting. The idea of being able to see someone's inner emotions could show lots of value for teachers in the class. This machine, after being tested in the classroom, could be used to make even more accurate and in-depth machines that could go even deeper. All it takes is it starting off.

There are many benefits to having a machine that is able to accurately find someone's emotions. The applications in the classroom would help make the day for a teacher run smoothly if there was trouble with a student, or if there was something upsetting a student you could use this device. The value of knowing what your students feel could help mold a curriculum that would be the most effective for their learning. Paragraph 6 mentions that classes could have computers that could detect these emotions, and change the way the lesson is and mold it to work for that specific student.

There is no reason that the FACS shouldn't be implemented into classes. The FACS is just a more accurate way of processing and recognizing someone's emotions and feelings. We, as humans, are always performing this calculation every day, as listed in paragraph 5. We cannot tell every emotion in someone's face, as they could be hiding their emotions behind a fake smile, or hiding sorrow or sadness behind a snarl. With the FACS knowing the emotions of a student in class who is struggling could maybe help the student and teacher find a way to stop the struggle. There is nothing wrong with knowing a student's emotions so a teacher can assist them if they are struggling.

This understanding of emotions and the creation of lessons that could help with those emotions could help graduation rates for schools go up, and help the GPA or work ethic of a student to increase. These benefits all could come from knowing students' emotions as long as the FACS is put into a school's classrooms.

Some may be worried that the FACS could be unaccurate and tell wrong emotions, but claims in paragragh 3 state that muscles in your face also dictate what emotion your feeling. These muscles can also indicate whether your smile is real and you are really happy, or if your smile is fake and that your feeling something different. Trained psychologists and others in their respected fields have contributed to the FACS to try and help create accurate assumptions based on the muscle usage in a person's face.

The evolution and effectiveness of the FACS could increase with the help of its use in the classroom, and the readings could become more accurate and more beneficial to the teacher and the student. The FACS could be used in almost anywhere, but I believe that it would have the biggest impact in the classroom. The effect it could have enourmous, and all it would take is one computer software.

The FACS should be put in classroom, not only to further the research needed to help develop the software more, but to help students who may struggle with lessons in class. The FACS's ability to read emotion will benefit student and teacher when the time comes, all it needs is to find its place in the classroom.
