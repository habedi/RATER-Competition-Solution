Schools often offer distance learning as an option for students for example homeschooling, do you believe these type of classes would benefit a child or not? In my opinion I believe this could effect children in many ways, but I believe theres more negative effects then their is good so I believe it wouldn't benefit a child. Some negative effects could for example be children not being able to really make friends and a children's mental health or emotional feelings being effected by these type of classes. Some children do want to be home schooled though, in fact many kids do and one of the biggest reasons of that happening is children getting picked on. Many things lead a parent to choose home school or online classes for their child but I believe this isn't the best idea.

My first reason that leads me to believe a child being home schooled or taking online classes wouldn't really benefit them is because it's hard for kids to make friends this way especially if they began taking these classes at a very young age. What led me to believe this is the fact that when a student is being home schooled their isn't really anybody else to interact with for example another student to speak to. Most of the time it's just a child and a teacher and since they wouldn't really get a chance to be exposed to other people how could they possibly build friendships. A child wouldn't really have a way to friend someone unless it was in a public place like a mall which would be much harder for a student to do because many people are shy. I believe if a child was going to a public school or even private school this wouldn't be an issue at all for the student because they would have plenty of people they could talk to and become friends with, it would make it much easier for the child.

A different type of effect this could have on a child that would be negative as well is, a childs mental health or emotional feelings getting effected by being home schooled. A student who is being home school doesn't really get a chance to interact with many people other then their teacher or their family. When something like this happens it tends to lead a person to feel lonely and could strongly upset them at times. It would be hard for them to go out to a public area as well it could possibly give them anxiety to do so, for example if a students mom takes them somewhere public it could make the child feel uncomfterable because they aren't really used to being around many people since they only interact with their family and teacher. I think distance learning would make a students daily life much harder then it would be if they would go to a school with other students, if a child went to a school where they could interact with other people this wouldn't be an issue kids would be able to speak to other students and not feel uncomfterable going out to a public location.

In many cases parents don't really have a choice though, their best option is to choose home school for their children's own good. In many cases students get picked on at their school which could lead to a child being depressed. In fact in many schools bullying is a big issue probably the biggest issue in public or private schools it happens all over the world. When a child is being bullied it makes them not even want to step foot into a school with other students because its gotten that bad for them. When this happens a child misses a lot of school because they are scared to return and their best option is being home schooled. Home schooling often works for children who are being bullied and makes them feel much more comfterable and safer in this type of environment. In this type of case it is best for a child to do what they feel more comfterable doing because if they continue going to a school where they are constantly getting bullied at, things could escalate and a child's depressions could sadly lead to suicide which has happened before. I believe this could sometimes be resolved by switching schools but it all comes down to what the student believes is best for them.

In conclusion I believe most of the time being home schooled isn't the best option for a student. I believe a child is much happier at a public environment where they can makes friends at. A child being home schooled doesn't really get a chance to make friends the way they would in a public or private school. A students mental health could be effected by being home schooled and it could also effect them in an emotional way as well because they could could feel lonely and be uncomfterable going to a public place since they only get a chance to interact with their family and teacher. In cases it is to a students benefit to be home schooled though for example if they are being bullied sometimes it's best for them to be home school so they don't feel like they are in danger of something happening to them.
