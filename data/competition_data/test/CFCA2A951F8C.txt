Some people can tell wheather someone is happy or sad. They can observe what their emotions is. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", shows how Leonardo da Vinci drew Mona Lisa. It also explains how technology called the (Facial Action Coding System) can identify human emotions. Here's the question, is the new technology(Facial Action Coding System) worth using it?

First of all, the new technology sounds cool and all that stuff, but how would this be used? Some advantages about the technology is that you can find out what the student's emotions are. For example, what if the student is not speaking when asked a question? That would be a good time to use the technology. Another advantage is to find out what a baby's emotion is, that way it'll be easier to take care of the baby.

Disadvantages about the technology is when and where will this be the best time to use this technology in the outside world? Would this technology work best in public? Probably not in my opinion, because why would people used this out in public? True it may help when people are in danger, but not using the technology proper, yeah, that's just a waste of money.

Another thing to mention is that this technology would only work in computers for right now. Students can detect other student's emotion with this technology. This would be a good use in group projects, but other than that it's basically useless. Not trying to be rude or anything, it's just that who has the time to use this technology? People are allow to use it but they'll probably not use it properly.

In conclusion, I think that the new techology(Facial Action Coding System), is pretty useless. Who has the time to use this? When or where can this be used? I know it identifies human emotions, but i already can tell other people's emotions by the look of their faces. That's why I don't think that the use of this technology is actually not worth of using it.
