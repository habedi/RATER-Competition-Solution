Phones and Driving: Credit Recovery Essay

Accidents can be the result of anything from being drunk to being a little tired. Yes, even being too tired behind the wheel can cause an accident. While there are an infinite numbers of ways accidents can be caused, but there is one way that is currently growing in popularity. That way is cell phone use while driving. Cell phones are already known as a possible distraction in most situations, but they have a great impact on the focus of anyone, and if not taken seriously it could have unwanted results. This is a very likely result no matter if they're an experienced driver or someone who is just beginning. The most common ways such accidents happen is by drivers trying to text, make phone calls, or use other applications on their phone while on the road. However, this problem could be solved very easily if drivers today used their smartphones blue tooth ability when possible, and otherwise refrain from using their phones. Cellphones should not be being used while anyone is on the road and driving no matter what

The issue of irresponsible driving by using a cell phone is more common than news stories today make it out to be. In the past it was more thoroughly addressed when cellphones first came out and the issue was new, but now people expect it and have lost any urgency to stop people from using their phones. Many people now think its ok. This is one of the worst things that could happen because the recurrence of these accidents is only grown from then. There are statistics that compare the accident cause rates from then and now. In 2013, a total of 1.2 million crashes occurred, and 341,000 involved text messages. Then in the first six months of 2018 alone a total of 18,770 deaths were recorded from texting and driving accidents. This makes it very clear of how serious this issue can become.

Although they're not as effective as hoped, many stats in the United States have established laws that will fine anyone who is seen using their cell phone and driving. Texting and driving is very much illegal today, but there is still a lot of accidents that occur. Most importantly, laws like this have little to no effect on whether the person fined will try and or do it again in the future. The government is taking more precaution for our safety. So why has it proven to be so difficult to take responsibility of our own safety.

The simple fact is that texting and driving is problem that should not exist. There are so many ways such accidents could have been prevented. Such as a using Bluetooth device, having the passenger text for you, and of course, just flat out not using a phone while driving at all.
