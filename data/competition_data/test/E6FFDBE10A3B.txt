Studying Venus is worth to study despite the dangers and can be a risk to anyone. Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Humans have sent many spacecrafts to land in Venus. Each pervious mission was unmanned. No spacecraft or spaceship has survived the landing for more than a few hours or even touched Venus in more than three decades. Many factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for us humans to study. It can put us in a huge risk.

More dangerously are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The temperatures are way different in Venus than Earth. The temperatures average over 800 fahrenheit. In Venus the atomopheric pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience here on Earth. Those conditions are extremely dangerous compare to what humans on Earth encounter.

Venus also has the most hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat Venusian geology and weater present more dangerously problems in Venus, such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lightning strikes. However, astronomers believe that Venus had once had rocky surfaces, mountains, valleys, and oceans.

Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth's levels. Not reliable conditions but survivable for humans. More importantly, researchers can't take rocks, gas, or any other objects from a specific distance due to the dense atmosphere. For that reason scientists interested in seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal even through-out the risks it can cause.

Anyone who would want to study Venus and it's geographic surface would have to be put at risk, even to just be a planetary visit. Our travels on Earth and beyond shouldn't be limited by dangers or doubts, but should be expanded to meet the almost the edges of imagination and completion.
