Dear State Senator(s), there's something wrong with the Electoral College. It's unfair to voters. The voters aren't really voting for the presidents. So what's the point of voting? The Electoral College is irrational. I agree with Bradford Plumer, the writer of source two, that Bob Dole is right: Abolish the Electoral College!

As stated in source two, paragraph ten, "Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." Voters can't control who their electors vote and could sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. It's not fair, and it would be better if presidents were elected by popular vote. More people would vote if it was that way. According to the article,

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , even Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agree on abolishing the Electoral College. So, we have them, and over 60 percent of voters who agree. When can the U.S. just elect presidents by popular vote?

Now, we could keep the Electoral College because looking at the article by Richard A. Posner, it avoids run-off elections. The article,

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , says that "There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.." You could use that reason for arguing, but here's it's weakness: What if the disaster factor happens again? When in 1960, a state sended two slates of electors to Congress.

It's already been agreed that the electoral college is outdated. The U.S. should change it's method of electing President because, it's unfair, over half of the voters don't like the electoral college, and the disaster factor can't happen again. Why are we using a process for electing president that most of the voters don't like?
