On May 21, 2016, Christina Mays had been told by her doctor, that she would be expecting her first child. Excited and anxious she decided to text her husband the good news. David Mays was delighted about the news and responded with a sweet message. It is not clear whether Christina saw that sweet message before her car slammed into the back of a truck while merging onto the highway. From the lack of response, David became worried. He attempted to call Christina and left several messages requesting to hear her beautiful voice. But to no avail he could not reach her. David knew something horrible had happened. Christina, a beautiful twenty-year-old was dead. Police ultimately deemed texting the cause of her fatal car crash.

Although the police found evidence that texting and driving caused her untimely death; the likelihood of a car crash increases drastically with the occurrence of distracted driving.

Distracted driving occurs anytime a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel or sometimes just simply being a teen carrying too many passengers.

Distracted driving is a huge problem, although it is not due to cell phones alone, they are a huge contributor. Taking your eyes off the road, even for a second, can be risky. Because operating a cellphone takes the drivers attention off the road, long enough for them to veer into other lanes of on-coming traffic. Because of this, it only takes a split second for this type of distracted driving to become a fatality. For this reason, it is necessary for drivers to focus on driving only and leave their cellphones in their pockets.

Secondly, text messaging requires you to visually and manually use sometimes both of your hands; it is by far the most frightening distraction used by not just teens, but adults as well. Most vehicles are considered a weapon. Consequently, they can cause extreme damages during a crash. This is why it is never safe to take your hands off the wheel, even to answer a call. As a result of this, some states have chosen to pass laws prohibiting motorist form using their cellular devices while operating a motor vehicle.

Lastly, most of us realize that social media rules the land. In this day in age, if it's not recorded it didn't happen. Seeing that teen drivers lack experience while driving. Consequently, means that they require more focus than experienced drivers. Therefore, carrying too many passengers while trying to operate a cellphone is hazardous to all parties involved, including innocent bystanders. Studies have shown that too many passengers can be a huge distraction, especially while using a cell phone.

In conclusion, texting and any type of distracted driving seems to be a social issue and will possibly take individuals awhile to change or completely stop. Hopefully people will understand sooner than later, that multitasking while driving is dangerous for all.
