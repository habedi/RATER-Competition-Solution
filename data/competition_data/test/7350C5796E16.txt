Dear Principal,

I have begun to notice some of my friends are beginning to do community service. I've also know that you are thinking that its not such a bad idea for every student to perform some sort of community help. I do agree and disagree with this but there may be some issues to having every student some community work .

I personally believe that no student should be forced to have to do community service but can if they please. I say this knowing that some kids have other activities that take place through out their days which may intervene with there community service jobs. For athletes or people that have something after school or before school daily and has no spare time to work in the community. I also think that its unfair to make someone do something they don't feel they should have to do because if they wanted to do it they would have signed up for on their own rather then to be told they must do it.

I also think that its a good idea because it gives us a chance to help our community. It also gives us a chance to get away from the usual and try to make a change throughout our neighborhoods or anything in our environment. Also we will be doing our parts by getting an education and helping others for our community. I also think it would make us look like a better as a community, school, and district because we are helping out everyone and working together.

This decision is for you to decide whether or not we as students will have to or wont have to do community service. We as a community need to do our parts and so do you and if that's what it takes then we need to work together. I know that some may agree and others may not but I believe both ways and so do others.

Sincerely your student,
