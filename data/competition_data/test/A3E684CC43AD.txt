I think that in our constantly changing society that technology has become apart of our everyday lives. Almost everywhere you go you will see some sort of smart device whether that being a smart phone, a smart watch, or a smart doorbell. Technology has changed and grown significantly over the last couple of years, but school is the same as it was a hundred years ago. Students are still mindlessly sitting in chairs for hours listening to lectures about things they don't understand or care about. Technology is in almost every aspect of our lives; our homes, our cars, our doorbells, and even in our fridges, so why not use it in education. I think that students should have a say in the way they are taught so if students want to attend class from home and are willing to do the work why not. I think that students should be able to attend classes from home because they would be able to learn more and get a personalized education and they would have more free time to just be kids.

I think that a lot of students in schools aren't learning anything because one they can't learn in the environment that they are in and two they don't learn the way the teacher teaches. If a teacher has about 150 students they will probably teach to each of those students the same lesson the same way. Half of those students probably didn't understand the lesson the teacher just taught maybe because the teacher taught it to fast or maybe because she explained it in a way that didn't make sense to the student. If you have a teacher who's teaching style doesn't relate to the way you learn what do you do? You ask for help, but some students are afraid to. If student were able to work at home they could talk to the teacher one on one and ask for help without being afraid and the teacher could learn about how that student learns best and possibly teach them better.

There are 24 hours in a day. From nine in the morning to four in the afternoon students are at school, that leaves 17 hours in which it is recommended that students get eight hours of sleep. That leaves nine hours not including the commute to and from school and the time you get up so you can eat breakfast, get dressed, and all the other things you need to do before you leave the house. So lets say students have about seven hours of free time to do with what they will, but now imagine if they could go to class from home. They wouldn't have to worry about traveling or getting up super early to make it to school on time. They could just wake up and open their laptops ready to do their school work that would give maybe nine hours of free time if not more. In that time they could do so much not just learn more but just have the time to relax and do what they want to do. I don't think students get enough time to just relax and chill out with there busy schedules, so I think that having school at home would give students an opportunity they never had before that would benefit everyone.

Some people say that if we let students attend class form home students wouldn't get their assignments done and would take advantage of this opportunity and do things they shouldn't. Yes I do think this would happen if there aren't rules in place so that if that does happen the people that didn't do the work will be punished not everyone by taking away an opportunity. There are always people who will take advantage of the system that is there to help people but don't let them ruin it for everyone.

I think that this would be a great opportunity for a lot of students and would change the classroom experience. Although some people say that if students attended classes from home they wouldn't do their work and wouldn't learn anything. I think that students would benefit from attending classes from home because they could learn more and have a personalized education and would have more free time. Schools should make attending class from home an option in there curriculum and reevaluate the education system as a whole.
