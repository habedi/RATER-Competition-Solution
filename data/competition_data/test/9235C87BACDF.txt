Dear Principle,

Your idea about all students having to do community service is a wonderful idea. Now of days people just throw stuff on the ground thinking its not a big deal, but it is. If all people do is just throw garbage on the streets it will make the Earth look like a garbage dump. It is also bad for our environment. Animals eating it thinking its food and choking to death. Then if people throw it into the water the fish die from it. If students get involved it'll make the world or there town cleaner. then plants, and animals won't die from the waste that comes from the garbage. if you want students to do community service I'm okay with this idea. I'm sure all the other students would be fine with this to.

I also have another idea on getting them to do so. give the assignments as homework. Each day you assign the assignment make this the only homework you give them so they would do it. By doing this it'll give them something to do that doesn't require having to think. It'll also make them like recycling and helping the environment.

In conclusion, I believe making students do community service is a good idea.

Sincerely,

Your fellow student
