Ok, now how would you like to have a car that drives itself? I'm talking soon, like next 5-10 years. Sounds great, sounds real futuristic, but I just know those things can't be successful anytime soon. Personally, I would love to ride in a driverless car one day but that's a huge risk to take.

To start off with, a driverless car does sound prety cool. I mean it coulld introduce so many oppurtunities for the world that we've never seen yet. A driverless car could be the start of something new. Like Google cofounder Serge Brin believes, such cars could change the world fundamentally.

In counterclaim to that, THERE WILL NEVER BE A COMPLETELY DRIVERLESS CAR! Well, at least that's how I see it. I mean a driverless car, I know it's 2016, but that's going past the limits. It's all pure imagination if someone believes a driverless car will be accepted into the streets of the world.

There's only one HUGE reason I say it won't happen though... A driverless car will never be safe enough to count on. I mean be real, would you ride in a plane wth no pilot with only computed sensors telling you what's going on around your plane? What's going to happen if one of those sensors on the car don't react one time? Like I know everyone has had a surprise mishap with a computer-generated system before. Think if your car caught a virus or something or just was being used too much, your on the road, then our car starts going crazy and drives off the road. Who's fault will it be? What if someone gets hurt because of your car, not you or the car's manufacturer, but your car?

In conclusion to all this, I think it's a brilliant idea to have. It definitely presents many arguments, but I wouldn't be in a driverless car even if it was my only choice. I wouldn't want my life in the hands of a technological device or machine or whatever it'd be called.
