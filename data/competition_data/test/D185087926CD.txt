Dear principal

I think policy 1 is better because students may have to call someone for an emergence or call there parent to pick them up after school. But students have to know that they have to have there phones off so when they have a free time they can use it, because if the teacher see a phone out in class and a student is using it the teacher can take it away and give it to the principal and they are not going to have a phone to text there friends during free time or at home. So principal i think policy 1 is better for the students.

If i choose policy 2 we wont have a phone to tell our parents were we are or were we going to wait for them so policy 1 is better so we can tell them were we are and tell them what time we going to get out. Principal i choose policy 1 because it will make me happy and the other kids to and the other kids will choose policy 1 because they don't want to leave there phones at home and not text there friends during free time
