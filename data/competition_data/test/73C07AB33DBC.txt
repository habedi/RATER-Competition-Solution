To Principal,

I think its a great idea to for people to do community service . Its a great thing to do to keep our countries and states clean and keep the environment clean. Its also good labor work for people to do, they will get a great workout from it.

It also helps build up muscle, and its better to do that instead of being at home or at the movies or the mall sitting around being lazy all day not doing anything. But in other peoples view they might think that we make them do it because we don't want to go outside or want to get dirty or be out in the sun all day. It would also be a good idea to require students to do it because they can learn new things from it and so that people and students can learn how it feels to work and what people have to do each day to keep food on the tables and pay bills for their kids and how hard you have to work to get paid. So they can get a real job experience for that day and see how they might change after they do community service or how they might feel learning how hard people have to work to keep their families in shape and keep them in a good home that they are comfortable in. So they can get a real reality job experience. But whatever happens their going to have to do it some day or another cause once they grow up their going to be on there own and are going to have to pay bills and taxes and to keep food on the table for their families. That's my opinion but people might not like it or think its dumb, but like I said it would be for their own good and actually learn something useful at a young teen age.
