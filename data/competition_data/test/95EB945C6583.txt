A world of less pollution, less costly wages, reduced congestion on the roads, healthier ways to venture around, and less stress and danger. That would be a world with limiting car usage. May not seem like a rational idea but when you see all the good that could come out of the reduction of cars on the streets it could change your way of thinking.

A city in Germany by the name of Vauban, 70 percent of their families do not desire to have cars. Over half of the percentage of people had sold their cars just to move here. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way". Those were the words of a women by the name of Heidrun Walter who is a mother of two and is also a media trainer she finds bicycles and sound of children running about is a much more tolerant tone then the sound of a motor rolling by. The enviromentalists from the Enviromental Protection Agency favors the idea of car reduction. They stand for cars being limited would reduce pollution and be more friendly the mother earth. From the reduction of cars on the roads the congestion percent soared down a plump number of 60 percent. That's truely a magnificent amount.

I strongly believe that limitng the car usage would reduce death rates, reduce smog, put people in less tense moods keeping them more happy, and lastly reduce moeny going to greenhouse gas wages. More places worldwide should limit relying so much on cars, to allow us to function in daily life without them.
