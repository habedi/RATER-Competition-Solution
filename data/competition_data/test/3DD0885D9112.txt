Today's world contains greater technology than ever before, and it continues to become more advanced. Just one example of this technology is emotion recognition technology in which a computer can identify one's emotions from only his face. For example, Thomas Huang used this Facial Action Coding System to read the emotions of Mona Lisa, a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Experts are beginning to realize that this technology, Facial Action Coding System, could result in great advancements in the classroom. But will it really have great benefits in the classroom? I believe that there could be some tremendous problems with this new technology; but if it is used properly, it could have far greater results. Although there are some dangers involved, the Facial Action Coding System has great potential value for the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System could become a valuable tool someday in classrooms around the globe. But before looking at the great value that this tool could potentially bring, we must look at the harm that it could cause. One-on-one individual contact is vital to a child's education. Whether at home or in a classroom, a student needs an individual present in order to best teach him the concepts necessary for learning. If the computer begins to replace the teacher, then this Facial Action Coding System is no longer a benefit to the student, but rather a harm. On the bright side, however, the Facial Action Coding System does bring large benefits. Most importantly, it engages the student. Doctor Huang, innovator of this Facial Action Coding System said that, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." It would then recognize that it needed to better explain the topic or rather grab the learner's attention. This could greatly benefit the academic world. Students could be taught individually, at their own pace, and possibly even in their own way. Those more advanced could move on to more advanced subjects, while those struggling could receive the help they need.

Facial Action Coding System, a wonder to us all, could greatly affect today's world, but it must be used with wisdom. It does not replace the teacher, but rather aids the teacher in teaching. Teachers are still tremendously needed for our students, and their personal mentoring is still of priceless value. Yet, along with these great blessings, the Facial Action Coding System could be added to better improve our academic world. The world needs educated men and women, and this Facial Action Coding System, innovated by Professor Thomas Huang, could be the exact element needed better educate our students, and make for a brighter future.
