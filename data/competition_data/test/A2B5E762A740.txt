Dear Principal,

I believe that students who have a C should be able to go out for any sport they choose. I've heard that a C is average. They have spent most of the day in school and i think they should have a little free time. I know they should raise their grade a little bit but they can also stay for detentions so they wont have to miss their football game or other stuff that they like to do. Its not fair to the students who have a C that are very good at a sport than those who have an A or B that are bad at sports.

Students are going to argue and argue until they can play their sports so if you would be kindly to take this policy off. I lot of students would appreciate it so they wouldn't keep arguing. Maybe some of these student who have a C can grow up to be a professional soccer or football player or any other professional sport. They have dreams too you know just like you when you were little. Didn't you have dreams to become a principal. So why don't you let them play so they can accomplish their dream just like you did. I appreciate you taking your time to read this letter. Many student would treat you nicer and friendlier. You would be doing them a huge favor and maybe they could do you a favor by trying their best to get an A or a B. much for being our principal and for all the other friendly stuff you did for us.

Thank you very much and i hope you would change this policy so we can all be happy

Sincerely,
