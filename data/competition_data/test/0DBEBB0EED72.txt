Dear Mr. Principal,

From what I understand you are deciding on whether to make it a requirement for all students to perform a community service. I believe that community service is a great task. Currently the school and the janitors at this school are far under-appreciated and I believe that it is time for our students here to appreciate them.

I think that if our students help keep our school and our community clean they will really appreciate everything that the janitors and everyone else who keep our community clean.

There is so much good that can come from the students helping around the neighborhood. Students will improve their social skills and learn respect.

While the students are helping at places such as the nursing home, or the soup drives I firmly believe that every aspect of the student's character including their self- esteem.

Thank you for your time,

A Concerned Student
