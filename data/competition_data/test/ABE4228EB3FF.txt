I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you could explore alot of things.

The reason I think people should participate in this program is because you get to go on vacations and you almost get to explore around the world. You also are crossing the Atlantic Ocean and also going to China. It also seems like a fun activity because in paragraph nine it says that Luke was grateful for the opportunity. In paragraph five it also says that he toured and excavated castle's while he was on his way to China. You had to do a little work to because its says in paragraph seven during the crossings it kept Luke busy and he had to check the animals every hour. I also believe it is alot of traveling because in the introduction it says that Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 16 times. In paragraph nine it also talks about how he felt much more than just an adventure for Luke. In paragraph four its says that they knew he was a cattle-boat trip but they told him just to keep doing it for his service.

There is also many other different things to do if you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy and I think Luke really enjoyed it because in paragraph seven it says that Luke was happy to be alive. Also on Luke's second trip he served as a night watchman but he couldn't work for a couple of days because he cracked his ribs.

That is why I think people should patrticipate in the program because it sounds fun and enjoyable and you could also join with your friends.
