I think that policy 1 is the best choice depending on the school. Elementary schools shouldn't allow the use of a cell phone during free time because the students may not be able to handle using a phone in a proper manner. Middle school and high school students on the other hand are young adults and should be able to handle using a phone with out disrupting another student. There should be limits though like no getting on the internet with your phone, no calls depending on where the student is at that time. At middle school and high school, kids don't really get the kind of free time that adults think they do and its because there is nothing to do, no games, nothing. There might be a couple of friends to talk to but that's it. There are some kids that have no friends in that specific class that they get free time in. So there should be something else to do other than sit down and watch everyone else talk with their friends. And as long as they keep their phones of in class they should be able to use it during free time. So that's why I thing that policy 1 is the best way to go.
