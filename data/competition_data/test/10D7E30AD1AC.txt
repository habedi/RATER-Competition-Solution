Although, some may say its invassive to have this type of technology in the classroom, many experts belive it would be revlotionary to have this in the classroom. This wouldn't only be good for the teachers, it would also be great for the students.

Just imagine you're sitting in your class and the teacher is going on about something that your not that interested in. Sudenly they change the subject to something that you're actually excited about. The passage states "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored-Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". This would be great for the students because it would cause them to actually enjoy wants going on and the teacher will be able to taylor the lesson to their perferce. It would be even better for the teachers because it would only tell them that the students are bored, it will be able to inform the teacher if they are going too fast or too slow. The teachers will be able to make that adjument on the fly. Which could lead to better test scores and so on.

On the other side of the story, some students and teachers may veiw this Facial Action Coding System too invasive. Not everyone wants to get read like a book. Some students could've been in a bad mood so they walked in class witha bored or upset facial expression. Which can to the teacher trying to fix something that they have nothing to do with.
