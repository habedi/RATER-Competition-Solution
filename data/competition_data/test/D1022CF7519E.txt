The Face of the Alien on Mars

Have you ever wonderd what the face on Mars is? I have and I'm here to tell you about what I know about this face or piece of land on Mars. Would you discrice the land to be something the alien's made. Well working with NASA has tought me some things. And I will tell you what this face on Mars is now let's get started.

We found out that the face is just a landmark of Mars it's not a face. The way the cloud's were facing and the shadowing made it look like a face. And Now that we know it's not something another race made we don't have to worry as much. We also know that we took that photo in 1976 and again in 1998. We have inproved our cameras by a good amount since the last time we took it. Then when we took it in 2001 the image was much clearer and we could see the photo.

From the text it say's that we took 3 photo's of the site as year's went on. In fact we didn't have high-resolution or 3D image's back then. So we didn't really have the technology back then and now we do. Sending another robot take's year's to get to Mars and time, taking photo's that is another problem. Now that we have better technology for this we can take better picture's.

To explain this the cameras that we had back then really didn't have good pixle resulution. So we really couldn't get a good picture to capture this exciting moment of history. Plus we can now get excited about our trip to Mars later on. And we know what to expect a little bit. They said that we would take off to Mars in 2020 or around that time. And we need trained and willing people to take on the mission.

Now to sum this all up into one paragraph, ok let's see if i can do it. The face of the Alien on Mars really is a landmark not really a alien. By the look of the picture, the weather during the shot of the photo had dust and other partical's that were in the way. And the shadow's made it look like it was a face. And when we attempt to reach Mars in 2020 we know what to expect when the day come's. I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed typing it. Hope that you learned something from this. And I hope you have a good day and I will see you in the next one.
