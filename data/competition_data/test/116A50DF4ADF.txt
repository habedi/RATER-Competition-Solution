B or C average?

Having a B Average for Sports? Why in the world would our principal want to change having to have a C average to a B? If we change it to a B average some of our best athletes may be lost. None of the high schools do it nor college so why would we? We are just a middle school, it is hard 4 kids to get good grades. As long as you have a C average then you could still pass high school and play sports. Some kids just have a dream of playing professional sports so i think its fair for them because its not like they're not trying.

Another reason i think this is a bad debate is because, why would u want to do it? To make our school pride go down by our stars going out? Is it to ruin a kids dream or heart? I know we're suppose to be called a student-athlete but is getting a 2.0 not a good student? Well its average right? I hope and know that our principal wont change it.
