The term student athlete has the word student first. I believe that they should have a grade average of at least a B. The students must realize that there work will take them further than there athletic ability. If someone truly wants to succeed in life they can't just rely on their ability to play a sport.

A student athlete has the word student in it first and there's a reason for it. If a student wants to participate in a sport they must excel in academics first. The athlete should earn the right to be playing before they actually do. They can't just ease through school and think that they'll be ok.

Most athletes don't make it on their ability to play a game and will excel in something else. The student should realize it is only just a game and they should focus on other things than just that game. When a person goes to college it is based on their grades on an act or an sat as well as their grade point average.

There are many reasons why a student athlete needs to excel at his academics. They need to be ready for life after the game. A student should actually try in school instead of just coasting through school with grades that will let him pass for athletics. The teachers are here to teach you and if they don't want to try they shouldn't be allowed to play.
