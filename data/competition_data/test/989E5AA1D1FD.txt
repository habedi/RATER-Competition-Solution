I strongly disagree they sound not use a computer to express how people feel, I think if a person wants you to know how they feel they will tell you. As the passive provides, "Empathy ( feeling someone ele's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions" (Nick D'Alto). This showes the readers that really anyone can change there emotions and make you think they feel this way because we have the ability to change just how we feel, we have self control over it. people can creat a facial expression like how they do in acting when they computure reads your face. So if i person wants to express how they feel wth other they will tell you, but you dont need technolgy to have a person tell u how they feel." For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face" ( Nick D'Alto). This showing that a human eye can detect the emotion by a facial expression." Imagin a computer that knows when you're happy or sad" ( Nick D'Alto) First off that would be creepy but, most important can a computure change the way you feel by telling you how you feel? Wouldnt you know how you feel? " A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confusted or bored," DR . HUnang predicts. If you look at a students face you can tell by they way there face expression is that they are confused or bored. Plus you in school most likley your bored. If a student is confused they are also able to ask any questions. Most students feel stupid when they as what something is or what it means, but not asking doesnt help. So you can truly tell how people feel.
