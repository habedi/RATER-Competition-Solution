Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that students should be involved in community service because then it gives other schools good examples on how great our school is. And it also sets a good example. If we do community service then we are helping our environment and grow big as a society. We will be helping the earth and stop pollution.

If all students perform it then the more help there will be to help out. My idea is to have groups of people every week to stay after school and do community service. Students can pick out the people they would like to work with and turn a sheet in for what team they are on and what grade and then the teachers will set out who goes with who, depending on the number of how big the group is then it will all be sorted out.

That's one way of doing it and then the other thing that might interrupt that is if they are in after school activities then those kids wont have to do it but when their activity is over with for the year then they will have to be in the week they are called in to doing community service.

And every Friday instead of having advisory we can try and clean up the community, like, picking up bottles, paper, cans, and any kind of garbage that might be on the ground.

Like I said before this can make a big difference in the world and make not just students but every one to actually care about how our environment looks and feels like.

Just like my mom always tells me "If you want you're room to be clean all you need to do is clean it up."

I always think about that saying that my mom tells me when i think about cleaning the environment.

But i really do think that you should follow this idea it might take along time but its all worth it if you're helping something be strong again.
