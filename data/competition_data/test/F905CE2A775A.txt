Dear Principal,

I think cell phones are an issue in school because sometimes there doesn't seem to be all that much learning going on. I believe that our school should use Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all. Students come to school to learn, not fiddle around with their phones.

Cell phones are just too distracting. While they are useful at times, like calling a parent after school or for emergencies, students shouldn't be messing around with them all the time. If kids were allowed to have phones they would be texting a friend in study hall, instead of using that time to be doing homework or studying. Plus not all students would follow that rule- some would be texting in class to their buddy who is in lunch or something. Imagine all the trouble it would cause. How are we to learn anything with the distraction of cell phones?

So even though cell phones prove useful at times, they can also be a problem and ruin our learning environment. So, which shall it be? Cell phones? No cell phones? I think learning would greatly improve if we got rid of cell phones in school once and for all.
