Do you guys like getting home and relaxing after a day at school? Do you like hanging out with your friends after school? Or do you like staying after school to do an extracurricular? I disagree with the decision because they might have homework, they wanna get home to be with there family, and they might have a sports practice or game.

If you have homework I would rather be at home doing it instead doing an after school activity. What happens if you have a study guide for homework and it's due the next day you wanna get started on it right away and not stay after school. An example was when I was in 6th and I had 2 study guides to do but I had to go to a club I was in but I decided to skip my club and do my study guides.

If i have a family member come over I rarely ever see I won't stay for the extracurricular activity. Would you rather go home and see your family or stay after for an activity? An example was when I was in elementary school and my great grandmother came to town and I had a club after school and I decided to skip because I rarely see my great grandma.

If you play sports you probably love it if you have an extracurricular activity you won't be able to go to practice or you could miss a game. I have sporting events all the time if I have practice or a game I won't go to the extracurricular activity. An example was this year in 8th grade I had a after school appointment with my science teacher but I also had a really important basketball game I told my teacher I couldn't make it and i'll make it up and she was fine with it so I went to the game.

In conclusion I disagree with the principal because nobody should have to do something they don't wanna do. I disagree with the decision because they might have homework, they wanna get home to be with there family, and they might have a sports practice or game.
