I think the principle is doing a good thing but there are some disadvantages to that because i don't even have a B average. It would help students by making them try harder to exceed a B average. It would also help discipline kids because your taking their most favorite thing away to make the achieve their least favorite which is school. Its also a good thing because a lot of kids don't do their homework due to being busy with extracurricular activities such as sports. I know these thing because these are problems I have.

There are many pros and cons of this topic. Some pros are that it will encourage students who play sports to get good grades and keep them there. Also it might help kids in the future to know that you have to get through the hard stuff to get to the fun stuff. "When the tuff gets going the going gets tuff" this a good quote that relates to this topic. Because as you grow up things only get harder so you mine as well start now. I wish my principle would make this a rule because then i would try my hardest because not only is school my life sports is.

But there are many cons to this topic such as not everybody who plays sports is as academically gifted as people who only focus on school. I'm not saying its impossible for some people to get and maintain a B average but it would more difficult for others. Some people were raised to play sports some were raised to be good in school or even both. I was raised to do both because i love sports but i also strive for excellence in school which is more important than anything in the world to me.

If my principle changed the rule for sports that you have to have at least B average, i think it would make my school a better school because people love to play sports which means they would try as hard as possible to maintain a B average. It would make be a better person because right now i don't have a B average but if that's what have to have to play sports I believe I could do it because both school and sports are my life.
