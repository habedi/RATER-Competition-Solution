The author have lots of facts and I think he needs to add his ideas so people can see what he thinks. I think Venus is cool but I didn't know that it was that close to the planet Earth. I also feel like people dont find facts fun because people dont want to know all the fact. And I can see this could happen in like in 2040 or longer and if I would be alive I would not because it would be alote of money to go to a planet and I would miss the planet Earth.

Yes the author did support this idea but he could add more of his ideas because I dont really understand if you could live on it because how would you get food, water, pets and have fun on Venus. And people would also be mostlikey dupest and fat because people are not going to go outside to go play and you cant talk to enyone. And if the spacecraft was unmanned and for good reason then I dont think this is not going to happen eny time soon.
