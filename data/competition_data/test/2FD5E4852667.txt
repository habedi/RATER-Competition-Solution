What I think about the facial action coding system enables computers to identify humans emotions is weired i wouldn't want that on my computer or phone or for other people. I wouldn't want that because it seems like someome is looking at what you are doing pretty much like a stacker and i think that is weired. I think we shouldn't have that because what if someone is hacking that program and gets to my phone or computer that means they could see what we look like and what we are doing. It says using videos imagery the new emotion-recognition software track these movements in a real face. So what I think is that they will have access to our camera and they could see our face and how we feel and that is weired. So i thin we should NOT have that because you never know what else the can get access to.
