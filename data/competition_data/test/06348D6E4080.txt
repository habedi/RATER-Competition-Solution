Dear Principal,

I think that the new policy is unfair to the students who love to play sports but can't get a "B" average.

I know some of those people who have a hard time and I know that they are trying really hard.

They are really disappointed with the new policy and are sad because they won't be able to play sports anymore.

I can also understand why you decided to make this policy because a lot of people are focusing more on sports than their school work.

Sports are an extracurricular activity and you should have good grades to be able to do them.

School is more important than sports because most people aren't going to be a professional athlete.

I can see that you are trying to influence them to do better in school but some of them just don't have the attitude to want to try hard at school.

They think that they can't do it, so some of them will just quit trying all together.

Another problem with this is that there are a lot of people who don't have a "B" average.

This is a small school and there might not be enough people to have a sport team.

This would disappoint me because I have an "A" average and I want to be able to play on this team.

There are some people who like to watch the games but won't be able to if there isn't a team.

Since a "C" is still a passing grade in our school, you could make it where you have to have a "C" average or above to play sports.

This way kids still have to have a good grade to play sports, but this grade is easier to achieve.

Whatever you decide I will respect your final decision.

From,
