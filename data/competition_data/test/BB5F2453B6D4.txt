Okay so you're saying that aliens created this face on Mars?

Well let me tell you why you are wrong.

First of all, there are no such things as aliens, and if there were aliens they would have already done something to Earth and humans.

This Face of Mars was made natural.

As we already know Mother Nature can do things like this.

In fact, we see natural landforms everywhere.

The passage states,"Global Survey space craft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."

Juat becuase you find something interesting on a different planet doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

The Man on the Moon for example it wasn't made by aliens, and nobody says it was, so then why should The Face on Mars be any different?

In one of the pitures in the passage it shows the "famous Face" and then you can see a hill next to the face.

It doesn't look like anything but a small hump, but its pretty much the same thing as the face, it's made of the same thing, but it doesn't have a face.

Now this why you should know that alliens did not creat the Face on Mars.
