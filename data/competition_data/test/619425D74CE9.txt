The Face, a discovery on Mars. It was dicovered on 1976 and it was complicated to predict what it actually was. It was explored when NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible land places for the ship Viking 2.

When it was revealed to be a natural landform, not everyone was happy with it. The Face should be considered a natural landform.

I claim that it's a natural landform because it can be found on this earth. It wouldn't be a natural landform if it was not possible to find it anywhere. To confirmed it's identity, Mars global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997 after 18 years of the discovery. Jim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's MGS stated, "We felt is was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as could get a good shot at it." This senteces here shows how important is was to identify the Face.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. After they snapped photos of the Face, it was later revealed to be a natural landform. There was no alien monument after taking a look at the pictures. According to the text, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,7). Many people disagreed that is wasn't a natural landform, but an alien.

The camera used to take the picture wasn't an ordinary camera. It was the aboslute best camera at that time and it zoom in three times bigger than the pixel size. Some might argue that it could be hidden by a haze or mistaken, but it was looked over for the second time and it was confirmed to be a natural landform twice. If you were to use the camera that they used, you can identify any objects such as an airplane or Eygpt pyramid on Mars.

Overall, the Face is a natural landform. The landform is common around American West. Garvin stated, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." It's comparing a real landform to the Face. The Face today can be considered a natural landform.
