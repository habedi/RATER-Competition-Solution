People actually thought that the face on the planet was a sign that there was still life on that planet or an alien monument , and that the NASA was trying to hide the photos alot of people couldn't wait to see the photo of the face .

In NASA we thought that it was created by an alien , because thats what people thought , they thought it was bona fide evidence of life on mars because why would an face just appear out of nowhere it had to be an reason for it . so people thought that it was somebody on that planet or an alien . But people never really thought that it can just be and nartual landform we know that sounds weird because , out of all things why would an face just appear so that had people thinking of weird or different ways it formed or got there .

In all reality that it was just an natural landform some people didn't thought we were lying and just trying to hide how it really got there . Defenders of the NASA budget wished that there was an ancient civililzation on mars so we could really know how it got there . But nobody knew so we had to do more resreach , just to find ou that the face was not an alien or a signal to something like life still on the planet it was just a natrually landform but not everyone was satisfied becasue that was a weird landform . they said that the alien markings were hidden by haze .

When they took a picture with the special camera that shows every little detail .

The picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa , they said thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars .

The NASA and all the other groups thought that it was an alien mounument or a sign of life on that planet they never really thought of a natrually land form because it was weird that a face had came out of nowhere on a planet , they had took alot of pictures people thought that nasa was hiding the pictures . they did alot of research just to find out that the face was a natrually land form we already knew , they didnt cause they thought it was weird that a face just pops out of nowhere so everybody thought it was something different but in reality it was just a natrually landform that everybody thought it was something different .
