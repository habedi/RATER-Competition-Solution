Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I really believe policy number one is really the best because students know they cant use the phone during school so they decide to use it during class, lunch, or free periods. I think that if we tell the students ok you guys can use your phone only during lunch and free periods. if you tell them that they would be that's cool. but tell them as long as you guys have them off during class time. they will think well that's cool and have there phones turned off. but if you say no and say no cell phones allowed do you really think they will listen think about it if you do let them they will listen if you don't let them they will not listen to you at all i like the idea of policy one its great for us students. if you do agree with me please send me a letter back or just call me into your office thank you.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
