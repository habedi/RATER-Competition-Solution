Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I totally agree with your new rule on having a grade B average in order to participate in school sports. It was a very responsible decision, and I'm really happy that at least one person in our school has some sense (just kidding)!

Many students at SCHOOL_NAME tend to focus more on sports than they do on their own school work. I witness it myself; kids are talking about the weekend's football game rather than what our teacher is trying to teach us. Since they care so much about their extracurricular activities/sports, they often get C's in most classes instead of A's and/or B's.

Raising the grade average for sports really encourages kids to focus on school work, and realize that school should be one of their top priorities.

Keeping a B grade average is actually quite simple, but many students think that it would be a lot easier to focus solely on sports activities rather than to juggle both school and sports. What a distorted view, right? Sports teams require commitment, and commitment can be messed up when kids are stuck in detention, retaking a previously failed test, etc.

Also, kids in this school don't realize that sports are a privilege and a luxury rather than just a regular activity for their school. Students shouldn't be allowed to participate in sports if they can't have self-control and say, "I think I'll skip practice today and work on homework/study instead."

So in conclusion, TEACHER_NAME, I definitely agree with the idea to raise the C average requirement for sports to a B average requirement for sports. I mean, what have we got to lose?

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME

8th Grade
