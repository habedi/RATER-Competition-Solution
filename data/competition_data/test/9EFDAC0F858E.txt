Dear Principal,

The issue of whether community service should be required has been brought to my attention.

Although some student think this could take up the time they have to do the things they need and want to do, others think it should be mandatory.

I would have to side with those who think it shouldn't be required.

If you're going to do community service for people, it shouldn't be forced, it should be something that you choose to do.

I think that our school should have a few days of a certain month that we have to do community service, but only to show students that it can be fun and they can volunteer where they want to work and who they want to work with.

Volunteering is something that should be done out of the goodness of your heart, but if students are exposed to different types of it, they may be more likely to go out and help people, not because their forced to, but because they want to.

Students should have some say in where they volunteer and who its with so I think that there should be a sheet that they fill out saying where we would like to work and a list of the three people you would enjoy working with the most.

Every Friday in April should be a community service day where students choose out of a few choices where they would like to work.

They should be grouped with other students who would also like to volunteer at the same place.

As well as exposing kids to different places to volunteer, this will also give them a chance to be with other kids they may not see all the time.

It could be a great opportunity for students and teachers alike.

The students help out where help is needed and it gives teachers a chance to catch up on and grade things that they may be a bit behind on.

If students are given this exposure to community service and all its benefits, they will be more likely to go out and volunteer on their own.

Only a few times a month per year should students be asked to do community service and the rest should be when they decide to do it on their own time which, I hope, will be fairly often!

Thank you for listening to my concerns!

Sincerely,
