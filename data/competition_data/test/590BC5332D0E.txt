I don't think I should be working with a bunch of cracked ribs guys. Oh shut up you are just tring to get out of work,said Jon. Luke spoke back saying,no I Iike this job. Theres no way you actilly like this job,theres just no way. As this arguement went on Rob was silantly siting there,not getting involved but then Luke asked him for backup. Luke is right, how would you feel Jon if someone was yelling at you for getting hurt,said Rob. Shut up,Rob don't you agree with me that it is not fair. Not fair? The mans ribs are shatered.

Shatered? His ribs were touched. Luke yelled at him if he wanted his ribs touched by him. Then Jon backed out scard but he did'ent give up. The reason Jon is doing it is because he thinks that Luke purpesly broke his ribs. You see Jon did'ent have a choice to come here because he was forced by his mom. His mom sent him because he would not move out of there house and she wanted him gone.

Jon dicided that he would go talk to the captin about it. The weird thing though is he did'ent tell them that are else they would come too. So he went to the captin telling him lies. The captin got really upset and went to talk to Luke. The captin was very angry now and he was just about to push Luke over bored but he did'ent because he would go to jail. When he reached Luke he yelled at him. Luke asked why. Wy are you yelling at me captin? You know exacily why I am yelling at you Luke. No I really don't.

I am yelling at you because you purpusely broke your ribs. Where did you get that from captin. Jon told me that he herd you say that to yourself. Look Jon told you lies because even if I did do that I don't talk to myself. You don't, yelled the captin. No,said Luke. Great now I have to talk to Jon. Im comeing too,said Luke. So they went to talk to Jon. They found him in the lounge. They walked up to him and started to talk.

The captin told him that he had giving false infomation. Jon talked back and said he is lieing and he really did do it on purpose. The captin ignored it. So Jon told them his story. The reason I thought he purposely did it was because I thought all the people here were forced to do this too. Luke told him that he joined with his friend because they thought it would be fun so they did it. After they did it once Luke wanted to do it again because he liked it so much. After they told each others storys they settiled there argument and became best friends.
