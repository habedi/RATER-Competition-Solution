Lives of many are lost prematurely because of drivers who make the wrong decision and choose to text and drive. How many more lives have to be lost in order for people to understand that a text can wait?

According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, distractions are one of the main "critical errors" that lead to teens crashing. Teenagers who are new to driving don't have as much knowledge as an experienced driver. Taking their eyes off the road and checking their phones is a common and dangerous mistake that many make. Most adolescents know the consequences of being distracted while driving. As reported by Edgar Snyder and Associates, 56% of teen drivers admit to talking on the phone while driving, and 13% admitted to texting and driving. Being behind the wheel is a big responsibility. The driver not only has to think about being safe they have to think about avoiding any fatal injuries to themselves and/or others.
