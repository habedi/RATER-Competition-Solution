After some thought, my principal has decided that all students must be involved in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or be in the student council. I disagree with his decision because students should be able to choose what to do with their time, and students could have other important affairs or activities in their personal life.

Students should be able to handle the responsibility of managing what they do after school, and in their own time. For example, if students were busy with homework or clubs, they would have almost no free time after school. Time put aside to relax or have fun is just as important as doing school work. Additionally, extracurricular activities are generally optional, so students should have the choice whether to participate or not. While encouraging involvement in extra activities is good, there are other ways to increase participation than forcing students to do so, like putting up fliers or increasing interest.

In addition to this, I believe students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity because they could have important affairs in their personal life. Having to take care of a younger sibling, for example, or working at a part-time job. Even a sick family member is a possible reason to turn down an extracurricular activity, among others. Everyone has different circumstances; hence, it would be inconsiderate and nearly prudish to decide that every student must participate in an extracurricular activity.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principal's decision that students are required to participate in an after-school activity as it would be unfair to the students.. If students do not want to participate, they should not be forced, and we should be able to choose what to do with our time. In addition to this, students could have other things to do in their personal time than that related to school. Therefore, I oppose the principal's decision.Â
