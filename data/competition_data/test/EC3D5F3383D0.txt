I completely disagree with our principal's decision. Students should never be forced to do activities, they sign up for them because they want to. Some students have responsibilities after school and dont have time to stay. Some students also dont have enough money so if the activities have a entrance fee or they go on field trips often then that would not be helping their families. The students would be more stressed and tired during the school day as well. I do not believe students should be forced to do extracurricular activities.

When clubs go on field trips they usually cost money. Some families barely have enough money to put food on the table and having to pay for field trips or club entrance fees won't help their situation. If the student can't afford to go on the field trip then they will have to stay at the school and that will make them feel left out. If the students are not forced to join a club then they won't have to pay for entrance fees or to go on field trips. They also won't feel as left out and alone at school.

When extracurricular activities are made mandatory it can put a lot of pressure and stress on students. Most kids have chores and homework to do when they get home from school. When you pile up homework, chores and clubs it can be extremely stressful and tiring. Students will fall asleep more often in class and their grades will plummet, which in turn will make them stress more and make things worse. without them having to do clubs students will have less to worry about.

Some students may also be excluded by the other club members. If a student has trouble understanding something that all the other club members understand they might be made fun and bullied. If students who are not interested in any of the clubs have to join one, then they may just pick one at random and sometimes they may be unqualified for the club they choose. Other members of the club who chose it and are qualified for it may believe they are better than the student who isn't prepared for it and may start bullying them. This can lead to the student becoming aggressive, angry, sad and even depressed.

In conclusion I believe our principal's decision is wrong to force extracurricular activities on students. It can have terrible side effects on their emotional state and mental health. It can also have bad effects on their families financial state. If the students get bad grades and fall asleep in class then the schools image will be tainted as well. It will not be seen as a good school but rather as a schoolÂ that puts too much pressure and work on it's students.
