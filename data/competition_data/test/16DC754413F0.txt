Facial emotional expression technology. This is the new technology of today and is very much needed now ot say if i'm for or against it is another situationn. I mean using it might be cool to help people with depression and suicidall thoughts but using it without heir or their parent permission is not ok. So other than that I am pretty ok with this new tech. In the artical Dr. Huang tells us that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal", now tht to me says alot and thats because not every emotion has a real purpose but we do as human beings need them.

This artical also gave you some education as well. Tell us some of the parts of our bodies that help with our emotions like, " frontalis par lateralis muscle (above the eye) raises your eyebrows to show that you surprised". I like articals like that it shows you facts and opinions as well as educational things that you should know.
