Dear Principal,

Throughout the United States of America, pollution, homeless people, and many more everyday conflicts that can be modified and diminished are faced in nearly every city and town. If there is a way to reconstruct the society of our country, then why not do it? Well is would be an outstanding achievement, but it would require a lot of time and work. Therefore, it would cut time from sports, education, music, and spending time with friends and family. In this case I believe that students should not be forced into community service to help make our nation a better place.

To start this idea off, many students are already lugging themselves to help form a better civilization. The United States is not a catastrophe, and many other countries have corrupt governments and humans living on streets and in their cars. I believe that the nation's idea of setting up homes for our citizens is already an enhancement for our magnificent nation. Many adults rather are looking for jobs in our nation. Perhaps, if adults were payed for their labor, it would increase employment rate and make our kingdom a better place to live.

Students who are willing to perform in community services should definitely have the privileges to do as they wish. For example, I play tennis three to four times a week, play golf, play the piano, the drums, and know French. I perform these activities, not only for my pleasure, but also to make a nice beginning for my near future. I also am a member of the California Junior Scholarship Federation. I help our society in dealing with people in need, cleaning up our environment, and much more. If I were to take some time off from my activities and put time into helping our community, it would make this world a better place, but it would also clip the ends off of my goals.

All in all, they are definitely many conflicts that people in America face daily, but once again, other areas in our world face conflicts that are mush major. To my opinion, students should not be forced to do community service.
