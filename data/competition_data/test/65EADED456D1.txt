To principal:

I think policy 2 is a better policy. Most kids these days have cell phones and most of them bring them to school. Kids will usually bring them with them to class and lunch. Teachers try to stop kids from doing this but they can't stop every kid. Most kids bring their phones to school so they can text other kids during school, and then other kids bring their phones so they can text their parents or call them after school so they can tell if they are going to a friends house or if they won't be home from the bus. Kids want to use their cell phones in school, but they shouldn't have them during class time but they should be allowed to use them during free times such as lunch. I have an MP3 player on my phone so I bring it so I can listen to music on the bus and when I'm walking home from school. Teachers are usually pretty mad when they either A: Hear a phone go off or B: They see a kid with a phone during class time. Some kids will bring their phones to class but turn them off instead of putting them in their locker so they don't get stolen which might not go over so well with their parents, because most parents would be pretty mad if a kids phone was taken during school. All in all I think policy 2 which says that kids would be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during free time as long as they are turned off during class time is the better choice.
