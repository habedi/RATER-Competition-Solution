Hi im Luke and I joined the Seagong Cowboy program before. Its really fun we get to go on trips and really have fun. You can go on how many trips you can, but

I went on 9 trips in the Seagong Cowboy pogram. Baseally all you do is help people and go on trips. You help people by helping with there animals,unloaded the animals.

They also have some fun time too. I found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We cowboys played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time. Like i said its really fun.

The Seagong Cowboy program it open up the world to me, Im really grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs,and that awreness stayed with me leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years. It can do the same to you if you just try.
