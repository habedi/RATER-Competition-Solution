I do not think that the use of this technology in a classroom is valuable. I think the use of this technology is pointless and a waste of money, in a classroom atleast.

One reason I do not agree with the use of this computer software in a classroom is because the software doesn't understand everything that we are feeling inside. People don't always put on a face when they are feeling some type of emotion, rather they can just sit there expressionless and still feel angry, sad, or happy. I do not think this software is advanced or accurate enough to tell what we're feeling.

Another reason I find this software useless in a classroom is about learning cirriculum in the classroom. In the article it said that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,". How is the software supposed to know what we are learning, how we are supposed to learn about it, and how would the software modify the lesson to make it less confusing or more interesting? I think the software would be less useful than an actual human being teacher, because a teacher can explain and help you with something when you're confused, and not have to worry about modifying the lesson which could cause everyone to be at a different level of understanind of the lesson.

My final reason I do not agree with the use of this technology in a classroom is about the cost, and is it even nessasary? Since this software is new and advanced for facial coding, I would assume it would be very expensive. The use of this system to me, is just a waste of money, and is basically making teachers less useful and interactive with their students. A teacher is the one who should make decisions on how to teach a lesson or how to help a student, rather than a computer software that doesn't know what a person is thinking just because of their facial expression.

In conclusion I do not agree with using this technology in a classroom to help students with their learning. This software may be useful in other situations, but to me, in a classroom it is useless along with a waste of the schools money.
