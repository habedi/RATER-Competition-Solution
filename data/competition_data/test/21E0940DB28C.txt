Dear principal

I would like to inform you about which policy i think the school should have. I will explain to you why we should have that policy an why not. I will start by telling you about policy 1 first then policy 2.

I think policy 1 is a pretty good policy because it allows us students to carry around our phones an let us use then at sometimes of the day. I also think it is a pretty good policy because if we have our phones an something terrible happens we can call some one so they can help. Even if all those things are great i think some students will try to take advantage of the school policy. I also think some students wont even listen to the school policy.

I think policy 2 is a great policy because their are a lot of students that like to use their phone during class an this policy makes sure they don't. I also think its a great policy because teachers wont have to worry if someone has a phone. Even if its a great policy sometimes us students made need then just in case we need them if we stay for a after school program. Plus some students made need them just in case if they need something.

Those are my reasons why I think these policies are ok and not ok but if I was you I would chose the one you think you wont have problems with.

Your student STUDENT_NAME
