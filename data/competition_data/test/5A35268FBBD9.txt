Somethings are difficult to explain because you can never be sure. There scientific explanations for different things already, but some are harder to explain. There is a picture that was taken by NASA's spacecraft Viking 1 that shows a shadowy likeness of a human face on the Red Planet known as Mars. There has been many discussions to what it could be some believe it was created by alien life and others think it's a natural landform. There has been different date collected to supported these claims. I'm a scientist at NASA that has been researching this topic and I believe it's a natural landform.

When people don't have an explanation for something they beginning to make things up. When it came this picture they asumed aliens. Since it's on Mars it's difficult to think otherwise. Also many things like the internet and magazines wanted publicity, so they changed the story to be more interesting and give the people what they wanted. I can see why they would think that because there really wasn't much to explain what it really was.

The Face on Mars was something people couldn't explain right a way before being sure what it was. Since it was in Space things like meteroids could have been a part of forming the Face. People tend to make conclusions to quick and not think it through very well.

The "Face on Mars" was talked about alot and it's quite breathtaking. The picture they captured of a "face" is just a natural landform. When people sat in the Jet Propulsion Lab and they saw the image, it was just formed by shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. It was natural formed. Over the years many things have occured that have changed many things that occur in the world around us. Technology is so advanced that we are able to send satelites up into space to help us and to see what else is out there. They send spacecrafts and rovers up into space on Mars and on the Moon. It's just another Matian mesa common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia and saw more clear pictures of the "Face on Mars" they saw and it showed no alien monumentment. There were no signs that it could have been created by aliens. In the year 2001 they captured an even better picture that allowed them to fully see the Face and collected more data on it. What the picture actually showed was the Martian equivalent of a landform common around the American West. Scientist at NASA say it looks similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. That proved once agian that it's a natural landform. There could many explanations to what formed it.

There is always going to be thing we can't explain or control, but with new technology and advancements in our world more of those unexplainable things won't be. We are the new generations and we can accomplish so much. We are always going to be discovering new things and have new things to explain. There is so much more beyond this plantet and all the other ones. Things out in outerspace may remane a mystery for quite some time, but not forever. We are close to making a breakthrough. Who knows what lays ahead in the future, but I can't wait to find out.
