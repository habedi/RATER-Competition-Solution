"Driverless Cars Are Coming" discusses the idea of regular automobiles and automobiles that are able to be controlled remotely by themselves. It states that companies such as Google have had self driven automobiles since 2009 and have continued to work on them. The arguements stands on which of the two are better for the overall socitey. From my standpoint I believe that regular automobiles from today's day and age are the best for everyone. I belive that self driven automobiles are much more of a safe choice to go with out of the two.

We have come so far as humans to go from developing forks and knives to cars that can drive themselves. I believe this is a big accomplishment in mankind but I also belive that it's not practical and safe to do so. Cars driven by themselves will cause so many issues for drivng if they were ever brought on to roads and streets. So many things would have to be adjusted in order for the veichles to be able to be on public roads and highways. Driverless cars would change everything we know about the automobile and it's inner workings.

Laws would be changed immensely and in a multitude of different ways. Mechanics would be of no use to us driverless cars. They would have to learn go back to school and learn a whole new way to operate on these cars. Many glitches could happen within these cars and end up causing accidents and many fatalities to drivers.

Driverless cars are not way to go in terms of veichles. Cars driven by people is the only way we can keep control of what's going on within the highway and on the road itself. Driverless cars would cause more deaths and injuries within automobile accidents. We must stay with cars driven by people.
