I do not participate in the sports and not very many activities so this does not really affect me. But this is still not very fair because the students grades are C's. The students do like the sports and activities but it is too hard for them to reach grades above a C. The students should be able to decide whether they need C's or B's and they will most likely choose C's.

This change could help bring the students grades up but it also might not. If the change were to happen there is a 50% chance that the students will try to get B's. But there is a chance the students wont even try to get the B's. The students might decide to not even try to get grades unless the policy stays at the C grade average.

The students will dislike the new policy very much so it is a good idea not to change it. If a majority of the students that try out for the sports, and the students that enter the activities already have B's then i would say go ahead and change the policy. but if a majority has C's the i would keep it the same.

You, the principal, should try out the new policy for a month and if grades start going up to B's for the sports and activities keep the new policy, but if grades don't go up or they start going down change it back to the original policy. There should be a vote for the new policy and on the ballot the choices should be "try the new policy for a month" "make the new policy perminent" or "not have the policy"
