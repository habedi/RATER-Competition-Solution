Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that the students continue learning during their break. There is an ongoing debate on whether or not students should design their summer projects or if the teachers should. Many people believe that summer projects should be student designed but this is not correct. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be designed by the teachers not the students.

There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be designed by teachers. Teachers are better at designing things than students. All teachers design projects, activities, and work do do during the year for the students. The teachers get paid to do this it is their job. Normally if someone is paid to do something than they should be good at it. Teachers are also a lot more organized than the students mainly because the students are younger and aren't very good at organizing. Not only are students not the best at organizing but, they are also doing the project why should they design it too. The teacher once again gets paid to design all projects and activities not the students. Plus this would cause the students to be extremely stressed about not only doing the project but designing it as well. So the teachers should do the project because the teachers are also grading this summer project. If the teacher designs it can make it easier for them to grade the project and on top of that they will also know how to grade it.

There are additional reasons why summer projects should be designed by the teachers. The teacher always knows what is best for the student. Teachers are normally older than the students which makes the teachers know much more information than the student simply because they have been able to collect more knowledge then than student. This could mean the student will not know exactly what they will need to continue to learn over their break. Only the teacher knows exactly what the student will learn in the up coming year. Besides the student will most likely not know what to do the project on because most students forgets what they have learned after a certain amount of time. On the other had the teacher knows exactly what the student needs to remember and know. The teachers is the one teaching the student what they need to know in the first place. Lastly, the teacher has been a student before they know what to do to help and teach the student everything they need to know.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be designed by the teachers not the students. The reason this is true is because, teachers knows what is best for the student, teachers are the ones grading the summer project, and students don't know what they need to continue to learn. Many people believe that summer projects should be designed by students but this is not correct. In conclusion, it is best for the teachers to design summer projects not the students.
