Dear principal, cell phones are a very good thing to have at school just because if there was an emergency and a student needed to call their parent or guardian, they wouldn't have to worry. you shouldn't ban phones. i personally think that would make it worse, and here's why.

say at one point someone had to wait for the bus in a very unfriendly and kind of scary neighborhood, and the next thing you know is that child is trying to grab their phone because some stranger is coming over. then they realize that their principal banned them from school, so they couldn't call for help. we here on the news all the time of kids being stolen. for instance, the other day i just heard of 2 people trying to get two girls in their van. there is some very weird people in this world.

another reason is because, you have to cut the kids some slack letting them use their phones on lunches and break, i think, is a good idea. and i really hope you like that idea too. because face it, i' m pretty sure kids will end up taking their phones to school. and i know some parents who make their kids take their phones to school, just in case something may happen.

all I'm saying is that letting kids bring their phones to school wont be so bad as long as you have ground rules. which you do, so i really don't think its going to be a problem. if you let them only have it on during breaks, and not class, it will all work out in the end. trust me.

sincerely,
