Dear principal,

I believe that policy 2 works better because students will not be so tempted to text during class and disrupt others while they are working. And so that while testing days they wont be able to cheat off of each other. Also, kids won't follow the rule turn off there cell phones during class. And if they need to call someone they could use the school phone. So there isn't a real reason why cell phones should be at school. Cell phones are just a distraction during the day. Think if you were taking a test and all you could hear was the kid next to you texting for the answers. What do you think?

Isn't it a distraction to you and everyone around the kid? Well in my opinion that is just annoying. And think about when they are walking down the hall. They are texting and looking at there phone then they run into someone or they could trip and injure themselves and others. And if they and using there phone down the stairs they would trip and injure everyone on the way down. And that's why you should pick policy 2.

Sincerely, student
