How many times a day do you think you send a text message? Think about that then think about the messages that you sent that actually matter. In my opinion I think students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch or free time because it could be an emergency. and you might throw that statement against me by saying that it's nothing the school can't handle but it could very well be a private matter the student is embarrassed about.

Sometimes students are scared of sharing private things with adults in school thus they have a cell phone to contact a parent of legal guardian to help them with whatever has gone wrong. My point isn't that every time you pick up your cell phone to contact an adult it means it's an emergency; my point is that everyone deserves their privacy without an adult at school's help.

I understand and am fully aware that students may abuse these privileges for their own entertainment and pleasure however adults are still in charge and have every right to rid the student of their cell phone. Personally I don't care about using my cell phone in school unless it's a rare occasion in which I would like to contact a parent. I do not need to text my friends while I am at school because I know I will see them later and they're probably in the next classroom over anyways.

Another reason why I would want to have a cell phone privilege during lunch and/or free time is because of transportation purposes. For example, my sister recently got her drivers licence and now drives me to school every morning but I am never sure if she will be there to pick me up after school. Or even if a student has an appointment and it got canceled they would needed to contact a parent. Here at SCHOOL_NAME

we use notes to get a message from a parent to a student; but there are kids running the notes so we don't always receive them.

In conclusion I understand why you wouldn't want students to have such privileges because there's always the one goof ball who has to mess it up for everyone else but you have to understand my point too. There could be a private emergency or maybe a transportation difficulty. What I really want to say is let kids have their cell phones when they need them and take them away when they don't. I only hope you understand my thoughts and reasonings and I appreciate your time.
