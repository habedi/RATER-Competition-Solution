Extracurricular activities are as important as normal classes. Almost every school gives students the ability to join an after school club. Most people do not like the idea of clubs in schools. Except I think that in every school, all students should participate in an after school club.

One reason why clubs can be beneficial is because they can teach you something crucial. In clubs like TSA and FBLA majority of the club is about one topic They all have one thing in common though. They teach you characteristics like leadership and teamwork, which can be important in life.

Another reason why everyone should attend a extracurricular activity is because it can lead you to your future career. Let us say that you want to be a professional sports player in the future. You can find club mainly about the sport you want to get good at. Then you can attend the club and invest time in improving at the sport.

Some arguments people might say to go against about making everyone take an after school activity is that after school clubs can take free timeÂ from you. You can attend a club that is not as lengthy as other clubs. For example TSA, TSA is mostly going to competitions and trying to win them. Most competitions can take up to 10 hours! Some people might enjoy going to tournaments, but others might not. They can just participate in a club that does not take as much time.

Another argument some people might say is that there might not be a club that a person might like. Let us say that you are interested in board games, and you want to spend time playing board games with other people. Then you notice that there is not a club mainly about board games. Then you can suggest that club to one of the teachers or maybe a principle. Then they might add a club about board games so people who are interested in board games can have fun with others.

All school members should attend an extracurricular activity. If the club is something small like a coloring club, or a club about sports. There is a club for everyone and anyone. If our school had all students to vote if everyone should participate in a club, I would not hesitate.
