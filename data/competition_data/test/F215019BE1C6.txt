Did you know that Generic_Name has decided that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity? Isn't that great? Well unfortunately most students don't think so. Believe it or not most kids would rather sit at home and watch TV or play Minecraft rather than take such a great opportunity to participate in something new. I agree with this new decision, that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular though, because students will have a chance to involve themselves in a community, they will get to expand they're horizons and learn new things, and transportation won't be inconvenient for parents.

To start with, students will get to involve themselves in something other than social media and school. Most students don't spend their time doing much more than eating, sleeping, coming to school, doing homework, posting something, eating, and scrolling through they're feed again. Obviously this is an unhealthy routine to keep, especially for young growing minds who need to be more engaged. Therefore participating in something else in addition to your daily life will be highly beneficial. Students will then not only participate in something more healthy but they will also become part of a community. Being a part of a community can be healthy and fun. You gain support and encouragement in a safe environment and meet new people. Granted meeting new people and making new friends one should find no trouble doing. When you join something new you meet new people with similar interests, and having similar interests you have a common ground to start a new friendship easily! Joining a club or participating in an extra curricular activity is wonderful because you can detach from your phone and other work for a while and enjoy being part of a community and making new friends.

Another great part of participating in something new is learning something new. Doing something different is a great way to learn new things. As you expand you area's of interest you also expand your skill set. One of the most important things you can learn while in a community is communication. Communication is extremely important in your daily life whether it's with your friends, family, teachers, employees, your boss, or the nice man who lives two houses down from you. Communication is needed and used everywhere. One can also learn many other important life skills. Let's say you decide to join a sport, you begin learning team building skills, or maybe you serve on the student council, you learn leadership and how to be a good role model. These are great life skills. It's good to learn new life skills such as these and expand your horizons at a young age to later assist you in life.

However as great as this all is parents are still unsure about the new rule, as they have concerns about transportation. Most adults work late, with inflexible hours and have no way to arrange a ride for their child. Well rest assured parents, there is no reason to worry because the school provides your child safe transportation for when he or she is done. Schools have late buses to account for those who stay after school to participate in an extra curricular activity. Parents have no reason to fret as the school has them completely covered as they provide late buses so we can all get home safely and our hard working parents can relax. So although it may seem a problem, parents should absolutely not have to worry about transportation, for the school has made transportation easy thanks to late buses.

Generic_Name's new decision is one i strongly agree with, because students will involve themselves in a community, while learning new things, and transportation is made easy for parents as well. Everyone should try something new and grab this opportunity to achieve all the great things I mentioned. After hearing my position I would hope more students will follow this new rule with an open mind and enjoy expanding they're horizons as much as I will!
