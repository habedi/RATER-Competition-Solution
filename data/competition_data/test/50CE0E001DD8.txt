Twent five years ago a spacecraft was taking photos of Mars, while it was circiling they caught a picture of a face on Mars. The photo went viral and people had their own explination. Some people thought it was aliens, some people thought it was natural.

Since there is no sign of life on Mars, it had to be something natural. There are things called Martian Mesa. A Martian Mesa is very common, it's shadows around Cydonia, but this shadow happen to like like a face. People started to believe that there was life on Mars but that wasn't what was going on. If there was life on Mars there would be signs other than a shadow, we've done pictures of Mars before, why would something show up now?

There were no aliens or life on Mars. NASA took a picture of the face again with a camera that was ten times sharper than the original, which reveales that there is no aliens on Mars, it was just a natural landform. People disagree but Cydonia is hard to target, it's hard work. And Cydonia is very common, it's natural shadowing on Mars and most likely other places too. Some people still have their disbelief, but research has shown it to be a natural landform that is very common around Cydonia.
