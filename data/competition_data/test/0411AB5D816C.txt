Where I stand on this issue is that these cares should not be made because mankind is already lazy enough as is. I remember fro a song called In The Year 2525 the writer of the song is saying that in the future you wont need your eyes because nobody will look at you, and that you wont need your arms or your legs because some mechine is doing that for you. As is evidant with these test that it is mostly going all digital which I am also against. Yes i do agree it would help us in the the long run finacialy, as said in the first paragraph. And yes it does still require the driver to navigate through sticky situations, but the fact still remain that indepentant cars are not to be trusted by my standing point.

These cars do require constant maininace for upgrades and updates on existing roads and new roads to be put in its data base, which is just too epensive to be put to practical use as said in the third paragraph. These cars and be pregramed to do bad things just as if someone was driveing the car and can cause great issuesas i say about paragraph four.

So about this issue about if driverless cars should be out for everyone to use , I will have to say no, they should not make these cars. These cars can screw up at any time, parden my language. They cost too much and they can be programed to drive like an accual person is behind the wheel and can drive the passangers to their deaths.
