I think our principal should let us bring our cell phones to school, so I'm going with policy number one. I think we should be able to bring them because something might be going on with a teacher and the student might need to tell their parents. So the school won't have any problems with the students . If we bring our phones why would that be a problem? That would have nothing to do with the teachers. Teenagers need their phones in case of emergencies. I need my phone because my mom and dad need to know what's going on with me. I have track practice after school and I go to tutoring for math and science because my grades are my number one priority. I have to get into a good college. If we turn our phones off during classes it wouldn't be a distraction and we couldn't do anything with them and if the student doesn't turn their phone off their phone should be taken away until their parents come and get it. We shouldn't have to pay fifteen dollars to get our own phone back, that's just another way to get the students' money.
