Personally I think that the idea of only allowing students with a B average to participate in sports or other various activities is a good idea.

If students really want to be included in these activities, then that may motivate them to keep their grades up and have more self motivation also.

If students were allowed to participate with an C average then they may get the idea that their grades don't really matter as much.

Also it is good to give the students that do maintain a B average or higher a reward, by allowing them to participate in extra activities. This would give them more self motivation by knowing that they get rewarded for doing well in school. On the down side of this change, some students that do have a C average may try hard but their get discouraged because they do try but their grades still have not improved as they would have liked them to.

Another thing is that not all B average students may want to participate in activities and sports. Instead there may B some C average students that may want to be apart of certain activities but are not able to because of their low grade averages. As a B average student myself I know of some C average students that would like to participate in activities and they do try hard to improve their grades but the average is still the same.

If this change were to take place at University Prep I think that it would bring down school spirit more than it is down now. Although our University Prep is a high achieving school some students are falling behind but do try their best. Putting a certain average on students to qualify for activities
