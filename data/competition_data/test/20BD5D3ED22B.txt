The brightest point of light in the night sky, the our sister planet, or sometimes called the " Evening Star", thay all are as know as Venus.

The author has a good information by reffering from the National Aeronautics and Spave Administration (NASA). According from the article, "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending human to study Venus." It shows that all of those information sound believable because NASA is the famous organization and a lot of people trust in them.

The author creates an imagination to explain how dangerous it is. For example, the author says "Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin." That show how dangerous it is and it is easier for the reader to understand about it.

The Venus seems to be an Earth's twin "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." It can tell that Venus has some features that are similar to Earth.

Even though the Venus has something dangerous, it still has something that are anologous to those on Earth. Which mean Venus has value as well.
