"All students must complete at least one extracurricular activity this year." Principal PROPER_NAME said over the intercom. PROPER_NAME said to himself,"What is an extracurricular activity?" He was lonely and all he did was munch on food after school. He needed an activity to do after school because he was always full of boredom. PROPER_NAME trudged up to the school club board to choose a club. Something caught his eye that he had never thought of trying, he could become a wrestler and have his own sport that he could be good at instead of eating. He started the sport and loved it then two years later he became the reigning state champ in his heavyweight class. Students in schools should participate in at least one extracurricular activity each year because it helps them find what they can be good at, it helps some kids make new friends, and sports that they provide for you can help you stay fit.

To begin, the main reason that it is good to do an extracurricular activity after school is that a student can find out what they could become good at if they tried and their talents that they have. For example, it should be required for students to do a sport so that maybe the school team could use some more talent or need one extra person to step up so that the team can play competitively against other schools. It would make the team better and more talented because it would be harder to make for some kids. If a kid does not make the team they can learn from it and try something different. Some kids need a sport so that if they are like PROPER_NAME they can find what they can become good at good at.

Secondly, some kids don't have friends or could use some more friends. The students with little friends can do an extracurricular activity and become new friends with the kids that need friends. Extracurricular activities can help some students become more social so that they are not be quiet all the time. Parents of some kids work very late nights and they would have nobody watching their kids after school, this would be an advantage to having extracurricular activities as well. Some parents of kids cannot afford for their kid to do a sport but the good thing about extracurricular clubs and sports is that they are free and the parents would not have to buy anything for their kid to play a sport or be in a club. There are many varieties of clubs to choose from and all a kid has to do is find the club that would fit for them just right.

Lastly, some students that are not in shape and need to become physically fit. Sports can help you want to stay in shape and not just eat and eat all the time they can gain habits of eating healthier so that when they eat and eat they can make sur they are eating healthy. If you do track you run a lot at practices and if you do basketball you run up and down the court a lot this can all help you lose weight if you are out of shape. Being physically fit can prevent yourself from getting diabetes later in life, and it can also give you many advantages in life. Additionally, if you want to run a marathon when you get older and that is a personal goal for yourself, you won't be able to run a marathon if you are fat and out of shape. Being able to achieve some of your physical goals doesn't happen over night so this is why you should have to be forced to sign up for these extracurricular activities like a sport to achieve some of your goals.

In conclusion, everyone in schools should be required to do an extracurricular activity and find what they like and what talents they have through what extracurricular activities are offered at your school."I finally found what I am good at and I am not fat anymore!" PROPER_NAME  said." Thank you Principal Warner for making me do an extracurricular activity, now I know what I am good at and the talent I have!" Some extracurricular activities would look good on your resume for a job and would help you become successful in life. Doing something other than school is not a bad thing it will only help you and could with school as well. Students in schools should participate in at least one extracurricular activity each year because it helps them find what they can be good at, it helps some kids make new friends, and sports that they provide for you can help you stay fit.
