Alright, so this facial emotional technology that's supposed to know your emotion based on your facial expressions is wack. The articles says something about how being able to read student's emotions in class is valuable.

The article states that the computer will read a students emotion and modify the lesson if they seem bored or confused. Okay so if the student is confused there needs to be a more simple way to put the lesson. How will the computer decide wich way is more simple. what if its more simple way is actually more confusing. Or lets say the student is bored, we have the same problem. There isnt much a computer can do to make it more fun. I mean can you even make it more fun besides just wording it differently? It isnt an effective way to do it and even harder for a computer to do so. Its far easier for a human instructor to word the lesson differently than a computer because the computer lacks the real connection that a person can have with you.

Then theres is chance that the students emotion isnt even related to the lesson, but may be from the outside. Maybe they got mad at someone, a loved one died, a breakup maybe, or even thiers parents got divoreced. Not only would it be hard for a computer to determine the emotion is caused by an outside force but even to figure a way to help. The technology may even be wasted on helping students when there could be better use for it.

The article doesnt give you much evidence as to wether this would help besides saying it will modify the lesson. How, in what way?

Not only would it be difficult to do this, but would it even be effective? So maybe it is a little effective and the computer can put some things on screen to make you happy, but if it isnt that effective then there is no good uses for it and no one will use it. If you are creating something that can add value or help people in some way, it cant just be barely effective or even just a little. The cost of making this, testing it, and everything else going into the program, and for it to just kind of work is not an effective way to help people or even get them to consider to use it because it will just waste their time more than anything.

At the end of the day we humans have too complex emotions to create something to not only recongnize our emotions (which is the easier part), but to help us when feeling negative emotions.
