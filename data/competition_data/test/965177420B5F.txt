First to me this technology is not valuable. Why you may ask well its because technology is trying to take away what humans are use for. An example is that when we first go to school a teacher greets us why, would a student/parents want to be greeted by a eletronic.

Next is you can't really trust electronics because they can malfuction or even catch some sort of virus meaning that it can go haywire and mess everything up. Also another example is that this technology called Facial Action Coding System will have the right to record/ take photo of you. To me I don't think parents will not allow this technology to record or snap pictures of there kids. In this article it states'' Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at devloping better way for humans and computers to communicate. For me I don't want to be able to communicate with my electronic unless I'm on the phone with someone. Like right now they just launch out the new Iphone X where you can unlock it with your face if it was me I will not buy it because so many things can go wrong. In conclusion this technology is not needed we don't want it and I probably won't be the only one to think this.
