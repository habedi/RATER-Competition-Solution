To the principle,

Well what i think of this idea is that a "C" average is not bad it is well, average. why I think that is because some people get mostly "C" and "B". Also I think this would be a bad idea because getting a "B" in an advanced class will be hard and the student will end up dropping the class. Also having this will hurt the school reputation if smart people only play and they are not good, and this will also bring embarrassment to the coach. Also the student will think not to send the child to the same school, the old student will have bad memories or something of that nature. Also the student will not get liked if he missed an important game, and will become depressed, which will get his parents either involved or worried and he could end up with a psychiatrist.

So pretty much this could end up disastrous with the students, the parents, and just about a lot of things so if this happens the school would be horrible and everyone will hate it and there probably won't be more future students. So please don't change the policy because it could ruin us and the school. So thank you in advance.

Sincerely,
