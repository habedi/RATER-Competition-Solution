The author does not do a good job supporting this idea. The author has did not put what would benifit humans if we where going to travel to Venus. There are about 3 paragraphs that are full of bad things that could happen to a person on Venus. The other paragraphs do not fully explain why it would be worthy of trying to study Venus.

The author put a lot of bad things in his/her text about going to Venus. In paragraph 3 is states "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on out own planet. The state also states in paragraph 6 that "peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photogra[hy and videography ineffective.

The author does put some good things about studying Venus. In paragraph 4 it states "Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." From this state meant studying Venus could help us found out more about its past. The text also states in paragraph 6 that "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of the Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." This is one of the few ways that a human could explore Venus.

The author had stated some good thing but yet with every good thing that he/she had stated there was always a bad. The author also did not do a good job of stating why humans need to study Venus. The author states in paragraph 8 that it is good for human curiosity. That to me is not a good enough reason to send a person to this planet with all the risk that they will have.
