Dear Principal,

I think that policy one I believe is the best policy, because I think it is fair that students should be able to have their cell phones out when they are not in class. They should be able to, because the students aren't in class where they learn, so why shouldn't they be able to have their cell phones out during lunch periods and other free times. I think having cell phones out during lunch time and other free times is fair enough for the teachers and students. Some schools won't let students have their cell phones at school at all. I think is ridiculous that they won't let their students have their cell phones out at lunch time or any other free time. What of there is a emergency? I think, students should be able to have their cell phones out at school at all times in guess of a emergency. Lunch time and any other free time is not when somebody teaches you stuff so why, can't the students have them at lunch time and other free times? Plus, students having their cell phones out at lunch time and other free times at school does not affect students from learning stuff in class, at school. That is why, I agree with policy one better than policy two for any school in the whole wide world. I think that policy one is the best policy a whole lot.
