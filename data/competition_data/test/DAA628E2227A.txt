Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that students should have cell phones during school for 3 reasons. one reason is to inform their parents if something has happened. Also, sometimes other students wants to talk to another student from a different table but they can't get up. Finally, because the parents can tell the parents if something has occurred.

Students should be able to use their phones to inform their parents about some issue that happened recently. Also, sometimes the kid can tell their parents if someone is annoying them and is tempted to fight them, they can tell their parents the situation and the parents can give the student some advise or go and get them before things get out of hand. The parents can also tell the students that their parents are wondering if they can go in for a meeting and they wanted to talk to the teachers.

Many times us students want to go and talk to our other friends about something that happened to them but cant because they cant get up from their seat. The student can send them a text so that they can remain seated and not break the rules. Also you might have a brother or sister and you wanted to tell them something but you cant.

The parents can tell the students that someone past away and you're really close to that person. Your parents can also tell you that they are on their way to pick you up from
