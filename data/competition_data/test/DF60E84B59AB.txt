I think that Luke should get back in the Seagoing Cowboys program,because then he can see the sea, and he like's to take care of the animals he get's different types of job's while he's there the problem is that he craked some ribs, so he wont be able to get back in the program for a while if it wasnt for his friend he wouldn't have been in the program at all I think that Luke really likes his job he gets to see the world as he is going around the world if I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I would want to stay because it would be fun to be able to visit new type's of places most of the time i would want to help the animals! because I would have to check up on them like every hour just like Luke he didn't know he was going to be in the program but they just told him what to do unitl he get's back he he just got done with high school and now he has to deal with the seas it seems like he wants to go back home so he can finsh his two job's and then he could go to collage either way i tink that he was a good guy in the Seagoing Cowboys progarm
