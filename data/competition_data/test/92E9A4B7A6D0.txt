Students Should Not Be Forced to Attend Extracurriculars.

There are many people who think that students should have to do an extracurricular activity. However, this is not a great idea. Though there are many beneficial reasons to do so, they get in the way of the students wishes or makes the day a more inconvenient for parents. Extracurriculars should not be forced on students because the students should have full freedom as to how they wish to spend their day, it makes the day more inconvenient for many busy parents, and it can distract from schoolwork and homework.

Though it can be said that extracurricular activities would make the students more active and would teach them valueable life lessons, the decision of whether to include these should come from the students or the parents. Students should be able to have freedom as to how to spend their days. Nobody in the United States is forcing working adults to do community service in order to help their community, so we shouldn't be making students have to do extracurriculars. Sometimes parents can make their children go into extracurriculars despite their child's wishes, but that is more of a family-based decision, and the school should not have anything to do with this.

Many parents who work at home or have businesses of their own, such as a freelance business, might have trouble clearing out the time necessary to pick up their children. This is especially true when you have students that live far away from the school. Most extracurriculars won't be able to have busses to go to and from them, because schools cannot afford this expence. This puts the responsibility of picking or dropping off the student at their extracurriculars on the parents instead of the school. The students should only be attending extra-curriculars only if the parents are fine with them doing so. Finally, It could be said that these parents could simply clear out a piece of their schedule to take their kids to their extra-curriculars, but for some parents who run busy businesses of their own it may actually cost them to have to clear out that time.

Extracurriculars make the day more exciting and less mundane for some students, but what if the same thing could bore or distract the students? Along with the fact that extracurriculars would make the day more exciting for some students, it offers more things to be distracted with, as students might be distracted from schoolwork or homework because of an extracurricular they did not wish to attend. Also, if the main reason why the student didn't choose an extracurricular activity to attend was because they didn't like any of the choices, it may actually make the student's day less fun. Therefore, making them less willing to do more intensive schoolwork. There are many people, which didn't attend extracurriculars before, who may have struggled to finish their homework on time, and forcing these people to attend extra-curriculars basically makes it more difficult to it on time. Students who have already attended afterschool activities, who will not be affected, voluntarily attend these and know how to plan out their schedule, but many students have not had this experience before.

It could be said that extracurriculars could make the year better for the students in the long run, but we should not be forcing students to be attending extracurriculars. Forcing students to attend extracurriculars limits how they wish to spend their day, it makes the day much more inconvenient for many parents, and it also could worsen school performance for some. Students are no different than any other citizen. Thus, the school should not play a part in how the student wants to spend his or her free-time. Parents may not be willing to drive their child to and from extracurriculars every day, and it may make the day much more inconvenient to them. Plus, the child should only be able to attend extracurriculars if the parents are fine with it. Extracurriculars also get in the way of the student's schoolwork and homework. It distracts them from school and could worsen performance in some students. From all of this, it would be a terrible idea to force student to have to do extracurricular activities. Would you want to be forced to do community service? The same applies to your family.
