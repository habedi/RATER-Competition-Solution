Dear Senator,

Change. Think back to when you were a child and how much you have changed since then. You are now a grown man, you are the senator of Florida. Change. Think of your wife your kids have they changed? Change. From time to time everyone, and everything needs some change. Changing the Electoral Vote to a popular vote would be one of these "for the better" changes. This is because of a few things.

"Each candidate running for President in the state has his or her own group of electors." (Office of the Federal Register 5) This means that these candidates all have electors on their side when they walk in. But by changing the electoral vote to a popular vote shows how committed, selfless, and enthusiastic the candidates are about their jobs. Having the popular vote replace the electoral vote gives more authority and input from the people of the United States.

Richard Nicon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole all agreed on abolishing the electoral vote because "...voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."(Office of the Federal Register 10) This happened again recently during the presidential election between Clinton and Obama. Clinton won the popularity vote and Obama won the electoral vote. This means that more people voted for Bill Clinton but the electoral college decided to vote for Obama instead.
