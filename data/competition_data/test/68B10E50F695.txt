The policy on changing the rule for playing sports unless u have a B average is crazy.

U should be able to play if u have a C average or above. But if u or below a C u should not play till u pull the grade up if u pull your grade up u should be able to play any sport u want to play basketball, football, baseball, or even softball it don't matter as long as u keep your grade up to a C, B, or A average. On other thing if u or in the band and one of your students have a bad grade tell them to pull it up if not they will have to quiet and can't do no activities until they pull it up. If your on the baseball team u should have at least above a C average to play if u don't they should not play 2 games until they pull their grades up. But for a football player u should have above a C to play if not they will to sit on the bench till they pull it up. But for girls they have to stay out of trouble and keep their grades up to be in sports or activities such as band softball any sport for girls. The policy should be changed to a C average
