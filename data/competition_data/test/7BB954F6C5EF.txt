What school summer projects have you ever done? How much do you think they have helped you? School summer projects have the capability to prepare students for a class and help students succeed. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student-designed because they will help students learn the material, students will perform better in the class, and students will retain the material for a longer time.

School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students learn. If school projects are student-designed students will learn the required information for the class easier. Furthermore, this allows them to understand the material in greater depth, rather than if the projects were teacher-designed. Teachers should already understand the information for the class. This means, that if projects were teacher-designed it would not help the teachers anymore, because they are not the people completing the projects, and students will not benefit as much because the projects are not geared towards them.

School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students perform better in the class. To get good grades in the class, students answer questions based on their unit of learning. Therefore, if students understand the material they will perform better on the tests. Student-designed projects help the students understand the material, so students will perform better on tests. Also, students who do better on the tests will enjoy the class more than students who do not do well on the tests. Students will also be happier with themselves if they have a good grade in the class.

School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students retain the material for a longer time. Summer projects that are student-designed will not only help students understand the material for one test, but they will remember the material for the length of the course and possible even longer. Student-designed summer projects will help students retain the material for the rest of the course and any future courses that are related to the first course they took. This could also affect the workplace. Students who are taking a course related to their current job or a job that they are looking for in the future will have the material retained that will help them. This means that they have the ability to do well in their job, and they will make a good living for themselves and their family.

Student-designed summer projects help students, the people who need it, to learn the material, rather than teachers, who should already know the material. Because students understand the material, they will perform better on tests and will be enjoy the class more and be happier with themselves. Also, students will retain the material for a longer period of time. That will make it easier for students in the rest of the course, and related courses they might take in the future, and current and future employment. Because student-designed summer projects help students learn the material, make students perform better on tests, and students retain the material for longer periods of time, schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student-designed.
