Dear principal,

Many people in our school probably think that cell phones use should always be aloud. For me it's different , I think that cell phone use should only be aloud when students have a free period or a lunch period. This should be aloud because students may need to use there's cell phones for important things like , if there is a intruder in the school students might want to call there parents and let them know.

Students should not be able to use cell phones during school because they can be distracting & disturbing.

Cell phones are very addictive. Students may use there cell phones all day when they are at home. School is a place for learning not using your cell phones. Teachers get very annoyed when students phones go off. During school hours I think cell phones use should be limited at the time you can use them . For example, lets say we are sitting in English class & a students phone goes off. To you , the students who are also trying to do there work and the teacher it can get very annoying & very disruptive.

Students should be aloud to use there cell phones during free

& lunch periods because they aren't disrupting anyone when there cell phone goes off. Many students text their parents during school & other kids in their lunch period. Students may need to text their parents during class but they just have to wait until they get a free period .

In conclusion, in my mind students should be able to use their cell phones during free periods or lunch. Other students may think they should be able to use there cell phones during all school hours. Why do other people think that ? People can get hurt by the people who are texting in the halls & not paying attention. That is why i think students should not b e able to use cell phones during class time
