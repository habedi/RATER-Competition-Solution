Have you ever wanted to get hit by a car that had a driver that wasn't driving? I can explain where that idea had came from.

There is a new car coming out that can assit you on driving. But would you really want to take that chance.

Here are simply a few ways why I would apose this idea. The chance of getting destracted while having something to assit you on the car. The other reason why

I would oppose this idea again is because the liabilitity of the acciendent. And the last reason would be just too many distractions all around and risk everything around when you can just drive normally. Also known as being lazy.

First, the thing on with this driverless thing is crazy. They are so many things that can get in your ways and mess you up. All it takes is a couple of seconds to end up in a wreck. and all of that can be avoid by just simiply driver yourself around.

Second, with all that drama with the driverless thing. There would a lot of complaining about it. And say if someone got an injury by one of these driverless cars that google has came out with. Whose fault would it be the driver or the manufacture that made the car. Who will ever known because people would lie to save themselves and also get a lawsuit on the people who made the car. and tha would save a lot of time and money if they would have just stuck to the regular car.

Last but not least the people who make the car will have a ton of lawsuits on their desks. To save all this time they should just keep the cars the same and work on preventing those cars even safer before they decide on doing something else. this is what i would call pure lazieness. In my opinoin we should not what to take the chance of injurying someone.

In conclusion, they are unlimited reasons why we should not have these driverless cars. So suport this answer and we will save money and have a safer enviroment. And really just rethink about the whole idea. But going with my instincts to help the people who do not know about it.
