In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus author talks about how studying Venus is worth the trouble. One reason the auther might think this is because Venus is so much like earth it was even nicknaned Earths twin.

People belive that Venus is like earth because they are close to the same sice and they are close toghther in our solar system. The author states that "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system." also the author states that "long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth." The author talks abou how NASA has a plan for humans to study Venus. She says that thay will build something that will alow them to float above the surface so they dont have to be on the surface of Venus. Even tho they wount be able to completely explore Venus thay will be closer than ever. This is why the author belives Venus is worth studying and how NASA planns to do it

The aouthor makes very good points on why she thinks we should study Venus. Even tho Venus is the second planet from the sun which means its one of the hottest, it is the most like earth. "Today it still has some fetures like earth." The fact that Venus is so much likeb earth is one reason to study the planet.
