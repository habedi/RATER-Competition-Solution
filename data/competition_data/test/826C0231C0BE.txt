Dear Principal,

I am just aware that you are planning on changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I believe you should put this change in action! I believe it will make the students work harder and become more responsible.

Below are the reasons.

Before starting sports, most students have a decent grade, but after a about two weeks in sports, when you compare their grade you notice its like they have been slacking. Their grades just go down the drain ! After beginning sports, most children start to think that there is no life after sports. They believe once they have grown they will automatically become a pro star, or a professional athlete. Students begin to care less about their grades and focus on their sports. After all you can get yourself into a good college if you have a good background in sports! At least that's what most of them believe. Although some coaches try to keep an eye their grades, it is not that easy.

I think it would be much better to put this into action and let students know that being in a school sport or an activity is a privilege, not a right. And i believe that more students will straighten up and begin to care more about their education if they actually want to participate in sports.

Your Student,
