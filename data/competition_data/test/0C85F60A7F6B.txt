Venus, a giant ball of carbon dioxide, hot surfaces, no life, but said to be Earth's twin. If we're learning so much about the dangers of Venus then why even begin to consider to approach it in any way. Why not push it to the back of the line and continue to study Mars, a place where you can actually step foot on it's surface. Although Venus is shown to be extremley dangerous and risk taking, scientists can't seem to let it slip through the cracks.

Venus is made of about 97% carbon dioxide, has an atmosheric pressure of 90 times greater than Earth, and is considered dangerous but has yet proved to be worthy of studying. The author states, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." Venus has also been hypothesized that years ago it was likely that Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have even supported many different kinds of life. So despite the challenges the author sumarizes that because it resembles so closely to Earth it wouldn't make sence not to study it and try to rehinder all of the information they can from Venus.

So even though there are several factors that take play in the study of Venus it doesn't seem by the authors statements that they're stopping anytime soon. They will continue to advance their technology until they are able to explore it to the fullest.
