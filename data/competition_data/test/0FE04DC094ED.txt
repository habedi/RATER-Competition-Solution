Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Usually, these projects are made by teachers, but students should be able to make their own projects. These projects should be student-designed because students will time their time and do it, be creative with the project, and they will be excited about it and learn something new.

As students make their own summer projects, they will take their time and do it. They will choose the topic they want and start planning to make sure everything will look right. They wont feel the need to get it done so quickly. Students will want their projects to look like nice. I had these two friends who were in two different classrooms. The first teacher made the summer project and the second teacher let their students make their own project. The one friend who had the teacher that made the project, she felt like since it was already planned out, that she didnt feel that it was necessary to do it at that moment and she ended up doing it the day before it was due. The second friend who made her own project, she took her time and did it. She planned it out. She finished the project a month early. However, some students who do make their own projects end up doing it a week before its due, but that's better than having it do it a day before. Students will feel that making their own project is better.

With students making their own projects, they'll be creative with it. They'll let their creativity side come out. Students won't feel bored. Since they're designing it, they will have fun with it. They won't feel the need to procrastinate. Students will want to make the project look perfect. My cousin, who had a teacher that let them make their own project, made her project look so colorful and beautiful. She took her time with it. She told me that she didn't rush and that she wanted it to look nice. She told me that before she was never really creative until she did her project. She felt that when doing this project, she was very creative. It surprised her. So, making a student design their summer projects, it shows them how creative they are.

Students will be excited to make their own projects. They'll pick a topic their passionate about. They will learn more about their topic. They'll teach themselves. They will retain new knowledge. They won't be bored. In 7th grade, my teacher gave us a project to do over the summer. It wasn't fun. It was boring. I didn't learn anything new. It was the same thing, I learned in class. It made me not want to do it. So, I forgot about the project the whole summer and I ended up doing it on the first day of school. It was rushed, but I didn't care because it didn't interest me. If I were to do a project that I was going to make, It will make me feel excited about it. It will make me want to do it. I will have picked something I didn't know about and from that I will have learned something new. I would want to finish it and see the outcome of it. By the student designing the project, they will be excited and learn something new.

Overall, students designing their own projects is better than the teacher designing it because students will do it and take their time on it, will be creative, and be excited about it and learn something new. They won't feel bored and won't procrastinate. They won't do it a day before it's due. They'll plan and take their time. They'll feel proud about their work. So, schools should have students design their summer projects because they will continue to learn during their break.
