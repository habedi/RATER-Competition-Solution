Dear TEACHER_NAME

I know that you have considered two policies regarding the cell phones and the students. And I know it must be a tough decision considering the emergency's that happen in the everyday life. It will either let the students have their cell phones during school and turned off or not bringing one at all. Well I think that the best policy will be letting us bring a cell phone and turning it off during class but letting us use it during lunch hours or other free times.

Now i know you must be thinking that this is a terrible idea but if you really think about it, it all makes a lot of sense. Just imagine that all of a sudden there's a big lockdown and none of the teachers have access a phone but luckily, a student has a cell phone and is able to contact the police. Wouldn't that be a life saver?

Cell phones are very useful in a lot of scenarios.

Now i know you thinking 'What about during class? Would students secretly want to use their cell phones to text their other classmates?' Of course some students will try to do this but that is why teachers need to be very attentive to their students and what they are doing. If a student gets caught using a cell phone, the teacher takes it away and a parent has to come pick it up. If the parent doesn't come, then there will be a phone call home explaining why the cell phone was taken away from the student. I hope you do consider my request about the cell phones and why we should keep them in school I think it will be very useful in most occasions for everyone.
