Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. she is allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time my possion is that its a not a good idea to use phones while in free time and lunch periods because people will give out maybe test answers, make drama out of something and call people who are in different schools that don't have the same rules ass use.

Additionally people maybe well give out answers to a big test. by this i mean the answers might be wrong and people are copying what the person text them. the teacher might of change each test for each period. People are going to get mad at the person who give the answers to them. for example my sister friend text her the math quiz answers and she got caught and fail the test she told me " never let someone bring you down with them its a big deal."

People would make drama over something little. to help my answer what i mean is people would get there phones stolen. People would say someone did it and get them suspended and it may not be them.

they probably would fight over a phone that looks better then there. there's this one time my friend RELATIVE_NAME that got into a big problem over a phone she said " i would never use my phone in school property again".

Furthermore people who text other people from other schools might get there phone taken always. all schools don't have the same rules. they would get mad at the person for making a mistake like that. People just don't get the point that they need to pay attention to class and worry about school. school is only 9 hours and that's it you could have the rest of the time to text. i used to get in trouble a lot and get my phone taken always. till this one day my mom said "you have all day to text get your grades up."

Looking back one can see that your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. she is allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time wether its people will give out maybe test answers, make drama out of something or call people who are in different schools that don't have the same rules ass use. now if you excuse me i have to listen to my teacher and get a good grade in my test.
