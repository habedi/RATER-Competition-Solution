BAM!!!!. Knowing that you crashed your new driverless car due to a technical failure, must suck. Driverless cars should be a dream not a goal. I am against the development of these cars, Its dangerous!.These cars require lots of attention because you never know your car could crash at any time.

The main reason why I am against driverless cars is because the danger it could cause. technology always fails at one point in life and using it on cars could cost a life. As said in paragraph 9, " If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?". Driverless cars requires lots of attention even though they're "Driverless". These cars arent smart enough to recognize signs or advanced problems, paragraph 8 states "Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?",

Driverless cars coming soon, What? before even thinking about driverless cars think about the money it will cost to upgrade roads !. These cars will not work off-road unless they want to put more more in these extras roads. In paragraph 3 it says,",but they require massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical. Building these car will also require lots of money to biuld and buy.

Thinking of getting a driverless car in your near future? I don't think so. Risk yourself and your money if you want to be in a situation of life or death. Driverless cars should be a dream not a goal . I am strongly against the development of these cars.
