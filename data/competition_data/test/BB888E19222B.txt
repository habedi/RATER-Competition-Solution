Giving young students freedom in how to do school work and throughout the day will benefit everyone greatly.

Students work better in a comfortable environment and school is most of the time not that area for students. It is at home or maybe a coffee shop where students get most of the homework assigned, accomplished. Most students already do homework every day at home and probably have a system to how to get it done. Making sure young students can work at peak performance should be a priority to schools, while this might not be the case with the overload of work most students are assigned each week. Teachers don't understand that many students have after school activities that are required. Most kids do not have the time to sit down and do three hours of homework day in and day out. And if the students take online courses the school day could be shorter, giving more freedom to finish a large portion of the homework assigned day to day. By giving students online classes or assigned work while out of school or during school will benefit the school and more importantly the student by giving freedom, self control and time management skills are taught to students, through themselves.

Students above the age of sixteen often have a job or play a sport. When a student has a job or plays a sport it gives very little free time to that person. Which means when an overload of work is assigned or big tests in the same week are happening the student becomes very stressed out. Often the student will be staying up late past midnight just to finish the work from all of the classes. Schools are teaching students to get very little sleep and be stressed out and walking one eggshells throughout Highschool. By the time students gets to college most of these kids are worn out and exhausted which is why college is the biggest hot spot for drug and alcohol abuse. By giving the students online classes or video chats it gives the student more freedom and the kids will feel more comfortable in the environment. This will lead to grade improvements and also teaches these young students how to effectively manage time throughout the day as well as teaches self control. Students might even find more free time throughout the day if working effectively with the time given to the student. It would be beneficial to the people who have jobs to not have to come home to homework late at night and get less sleep. Online school even for short periods of time would help the kids who are extreme introverts and can not function at peak performance while at school because it is so stressful and packed full of kids. Students should be the top priority of schools and the teachers within those schools but the kids in Highschool are being worn out and are exhausted from the workload that schools think is necessary.

While some students will continue to not pay attention and just not care in general within time these students will see the effect of it. This will happen inside school and out of school there is no way for schools to prevent students from not caring and not paying attention. Some students do benefit from a teacher watching and making sure work is being completed, but it would teach the students self control and how to work by themselves without needing a guide. These young students won't always have someone to make sure that work is being completed, the person has to be motivated not the teacher motivating the person.

In conclusion students will benefit from online courses. By giving students online classes or assigned work while out of school or during school will benefit the school and more importantly the student by giving freedom, self control and time management skills are taught to students, through themselves. Online courses could lead to a smaller school day leaving more freedom for the students. This would give the student more time to work or finish homework so that the student does not have to be up late working and getting no sleep.
