Dear Principal:

I think that students should be required to perform community service. The reason that I think students should be required to perform community service is students lived in this city too so, I think that they need to do something for their city. For example: recycling is not the hard thing to do. Student can tell their friends to recycle to help the environment. Student can uses the paper in a correct, but not wasting the paper. For what I know the paper are made out of trees and tree help human a lot for their health. Trees give oxygen to human. Student can also help by throwing the garbage in the garbage can. Even if they see it on the street they can pick it up and throw it in the garbage. As a human being we can do a lot of things to help the environment. We can plant more tree instead of cut down the trees. Students are the people that have educated so, they should know what the right things to do. Students today, they should know how lucky they are. People back then, they can't go to school without money so, most of the people didn't go to school. Instead of going to school they have to work to help their parents. Today, in the United States we have public school everywhere. All the kids in the United States are require to go to school. To be honest in my country we don't have public school like in America. All the poor kids in my country didn't go to school like they suppose to. They have to work to get the money to help their parents.

I think to do the community service is not the hard thing to do. Nothing you can't do if you try. Nobody born as a winner or a loser you decided what yourself will be or can be. I think students today, are wasting too much stuff. I think they should stop wasting all of that stuffs for nothing. They should save all the things that they has and use it widely. Everything is bought by money nothing in this world is for free. There are so many things that students can do or as the human being we can do. In school you can help your friends with what you know and they don't. I was helping my friends with their work, when they don't understand something I always feel welcome to help them.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
