Dear Principle,

I agree with policy #1. I believe that students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods because it's not like were in class. Were just eating food for 30 minutes. And the same with other free times, it's not like we're learning or supposed to be learning anything.

I've always wondered if this policy would ever be a option to the school and i hope it is because i'm really sure kids would love to be able to use their cell phones during their lunch period and other free times. And i don't think kids would abuse it and think they can use their phones whenever they want. they would respect the rule of only using it at certain times and if they didn't their would be a consequence like always. But I think it kind of is ridiculous that were not allowed to take out our cell phone while at our lunch period or other free times, i really don't see the need why we can't. As long as the students aren't using the cell phone in a way that it's not supposed to be used, i think it will go great. Or if you deside that we can't do that, maybe a week or two a month we can pay a dollar or two too use or cell phones during lunch & free times. The school would make a lot of money by doing that. I really wish you would consider doing this for us kids, and I'm sure you will not regret it.

Sincerely,
