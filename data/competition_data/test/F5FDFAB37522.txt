Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am a proud student attending SCHOOL_NAME. I have recently been notified about your plan to possibly require all students to do some sort of community service.

Well, you would be stupid if you didn't require it. As a child that has always been involved with community service I think it is the best way to help others and experience another world.

Students should learn to help others and help the world. This could change a lot of peoples views on life. It could make them realize they can be a good person and help out in a good way to the community. Most kids need something like this to make them feel good about themselves and they could have fun doing it at the same time!

Maybe you could make it a requirement that you must receive 15 hours or another amount of community service by the end of 8th grade, in order to go to 9th grade. It might just work in our communities favor!

I have many ideas for community service but here are three and I will start at something pretty simple. A day on Long Beach Island's famous beaches picking up all of the garbage. It is outright disgusting to see cigarette buds on the ground.

That would help bring people to LBI.

The next idea I have for community service is a little bit more interesting.

Holding a buffet for homeless people so that they can enjoy a nice meal for once. Just because they don't have can't afford a home or a car doesn't mean that they can't enjoy a nice meal. They deserve it probably more then you and me.

Another community service idea is having a carnival here at the school to raise money for a certain charity or group.

I believe many people would attend and we could raise a lot of money for someone or a bunch of people. That would really help, quite frankly any amount of community service would help so I really hope you take my letter into your thoughts and approve of making community service a requirement.

Thank you,
