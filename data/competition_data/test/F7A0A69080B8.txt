Dear principal,

Our students have done service on their own time they have done it make our world better or more efficient. The students here don't need to do community service it takes to much time away from home or activities outside of school.

Some children need some time alone to not get frustrated or upset. All students need some time to ourselves. I think you could put some kids who are always a mess or get into trouble a lot into a program like this but you don't have to put the school up to this task .I think maybe one day out of the year might be fine but don't do it as daily or weekly activity

I would ask what the parents think and the ones who say yes you can do it then do it for those kids. Maybe it might make them useful after all.

So take some time to think and make a decision it might be good or it may not. just make a decision that you think will most benefit the school and you .

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
