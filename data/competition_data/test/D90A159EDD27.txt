Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should be required to do community service. It makes students better people to be around, increases productivity, and the work needs to be done. Think of the last time you saw adults doing community service. this is mostly because adults didn't learn to do it as students, and now they don't feel like taking time to do it now. Students should be required to complete community service.

People who do community service tend to be more content with what they have because they see what it's not to have a lot of things as well. When you go on a missions trip, you sometimes see disaster victims firsthand. As you see more people who don't have what you have, you tend to become more thankful for what you do have, instead of wishful for what you don't. Plus, since you don't get paid for community service, it helps you to appreciate volunteers more. Most students could benefit from community service in this way.

Students who do community service would become more productive. When you try to jam in something else into someone else's schedule, they make time to do it. Students would be able to complete tasks more quickly, maximizing class time. Teachers would get more done in class, and students would have less homework. Students could benefit from community service in this way.

Community service needs to be done by someone. Most people look down on people who do community service because they "Don't have anything better to do". They usually just put aside what they have to do. Plus, people who skip out sometimes say "I'm too busy to do community service." Well, if we learned as students to take time out of our day to do it, maybe as adults we would be more willing to do it as well.

Students should need to do community service. It makes students more pleasant, increases productivity, and someone has to do it. Maybe if we taught students to do it now, they would continue when they got older. Think of the problems we could solve if everyone just volunteered. That's why students should be required to do community service.
