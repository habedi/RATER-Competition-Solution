The article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" the author gives many good reasons as to why driverless cars are the next big thing. Driverless cars will have driver alert features to them but the question is will they function correctly and not fail us causing an even bigger mitsake? According to cofounder Sergey Brin drdiverless cars are the next big thing for the future. It is no longer flying cars it is now driverless cars. Brin is a believer that a driverless car will fundamently change the world. As exciting and wonderful a driverless car sounds its is not a good idea. Technology brings many new wonders and fasinations, but the technology that will be used for a driverless car will eventually fail the driver.

A driverless car seems very intresting and many good ideas and opinions are being published to the public but will the true story about driverless cars ever make it through to the public? No because the manufactuer will always find something good to say about the car whenever the public says something negative. A driverless car will be another mistake to our generation of new ideas. The author of the article said in paragraph 7, " They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. " Then later it also stated, " This means the human driver must remain alert. " The human driver needs to remain alert at all times because we will never know when the driverless car will need human assistance. Leading to the fact the already the car hasnt been made but they already know that the car will need human skills at times. Already the cars technology cannot be trusted. As the human driver you will get distracted or may fall asleep. You may not even know the car is going to need assistance at times and before you know it your at risk for a crash the driverless car haas caused. Drivers will also rely to much on their car because they will thik it is so up to date on technology that it wont fail the driver. The human driver may go out to a party one night and get drunk. The human driver won't care because the car will take them back home safe and sound as they were told. Will it really though? Along the way the technology may stop working and before you know it the drunk driver will be behind the wheel not only putting himself in danger but everybody else on the road.

Some other issues with the car may also occur. For example the driver alert functions may stop working out of nowhere. In the acrticle it stated, " GM has devloped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in dnager. " The vibrating chair may stop functioning correctly and the driver will not know. The driver may not also know how to properly use it and may put the car in a mode that isnt supposed to be in at the moment. Who still reads the instructions? That is a very low number and many people just jump straight into using the object. Drivers will be to excited and they will just jump into the roads and not know how to properly use it. They will have to read the instructions while on the road and then what will happen? The driver may come up with a situation where the car needs human assistance and the driver won't know what is happening and they will start to freak out and just get themselves and the car all worked up. The driverless car will bring up accident rates higher. One of the many rates we as a country are trying to minimize as much as possible.

If the driverless car was to crash and cause a death to somebody who is just walking down the street or in another car, who will be most likely blamed for the cause it won't be the manufacturers. It will be the human drivers fault and be charged with many things that maybe wasnt evenn the drivers fault. For example the cars technology might fail, technology will not always be up to date, then the car goes out of countrol and the driver may not know what to do then the driver will have all the issues on his hands.

There are planty more reasons as to why a driverless car will just be another mistake of our generationbut those are a few. Would you want to put your child or somebody you love out in the roads risking somebody to put them in danger just because the human driver does not know how to use a driverless car? We as a country are trying to bring down death rates and a driverless car will just make the rates higher. Rates as in accident rates and death rates. Rates that we should be trying to minimize as much as possible. Driverless cars should not be part of our generations future.
