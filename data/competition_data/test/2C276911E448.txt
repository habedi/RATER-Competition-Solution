Summer projects must be designed by teachers or the whole thing will be pointless. It is said there are many contraversial points that would lead folks to not taking a side on whether students should design summer projects, or if teachers should. However, projects need to be designed and assigned by teachers because it will set the standard of validation, express uniqueness and diversity, and reduce chances of cheating.

First, having summer projects designed by teachers sets the tone on what the outcome should look like and how well a student must do. This prevents student's from simply waiting until the last week of summer and sloppily making a project that is eventually accepted by a teacher. Also, this action will assure the continued process of students learning while on summer break. The whole point of summer projects is so the students keep their minds fresh and ready for the next year, and If the students design the projects, that may not happen.

Next up, teachers will find expressions of uniqueness and diversity in the results they recieve from the students. Every kid is different, and a teacher should be able to recognize that kids best interests and strongest characteristics. With that being known, teachers can design and assign summer projects accordingly. With every kid either working on a project that includes something they are comfortable with, or something they might need to work on more to be successful. This also reveals the different mindsets and creative skills a classroom holds, while a student designed project may just be basic and super boring.

Last, the amount of cheating is bound to decrease when projects are designed by students. If a kid designed his own project over a span of a couple months, there's a big possibility he may cheat. These kids may also "accidentally" choose the same topic to work on all summer. There are endless possibilities and ways for a students to get away with the easy way out. Which is why, when a teacher assigns different topics and types of projects to a wide variety of students, it reduces cheating. This ultimately does help the students learn how to try new things, even if they aren't familier with it.

Although this may be true, many believe that when teachers assign and or design summer projects for students, it will come out boring and no fun. People also believe it won't bring out the creative side in a student. But, the understanding of a student being creative and crafty is how they handle something that is thrown at them. The creativeness that lies in a student is how they can transform something out of their interest into something they can enjoy. Teacher designed projects bring out the capability of a kid and what that kid can truly do.

All in all, summer projects are genuinely more productive and useful when designed by a teacher. It gives the students a chance to be creative and show unique skills, reduces the amount of unloyal actions such as cheating and working together, and it sets the standard for a student to meet. To all teachers who will read this, I advise you to keep the power in your hands. Bring out that student's inner strengths and challenge that student. One day, that student will thank you for not letting them take the easy way out.
