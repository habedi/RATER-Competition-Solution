Dear , Principal

I don't think its fair for kids , only who have a B average to participate in school activities. All kids should be able to play no matter what grades they have. Most kids already have a sport that they play and they should be allowed to play , not just because they have a C average. Maybe some kids try really hard and they just cannot get higher then a C average. Kids should still be allowed to participate in there school activities with a C average.

I don't think its fair for kids , only who have a B average to participate in school activities. Most of the kids with a B average don't want to participate in those school activities. Most of the kids with a C average want to participate but they don't get the opportunity to participate in there school activities.

Every student should have the opportunity to participate in there school activities no matter what grades they get , they should be allowed to participate.

All kids should be able to play no matter what grades they have. Every kid should get the chance to be allowed to try out for a sport they want to play. May students are very talented but they don't get the chance to show how good they are because they don't have the opportunity to.
