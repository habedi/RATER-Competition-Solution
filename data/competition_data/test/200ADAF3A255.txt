Dear principal:

I think that you should consider policy #1 because you may never know what may happen to a student in case of an emergency. What if the kid is asthmatic and in the middle of a class session, the student catches an asthma attack? I think that you as a principal should allow the students to bring their phones to school just as long as they don't use it during the class while a teacher or professor is teaching a lesson. But since you are the principal of the school, I think that you should bring up a meeting with the teachers of the school first and let them know about the school policy and what it is that is going on. Afterwards, I think that you should bring up the topic to the students and let them know about the school policy but leaving them off with a warning. If they brake the school policy, then you have the right to go for policy #2, not allowing them to bring their phones to school. If u were able to read this letter, just send me a letter or a text replying back to me letting me know about what you think about my opinion and how it will benefit the school or affect it. Hope you can understand us the stu point of view. Thank you and have a great day!

Sincerely, your student
