Many schools have grade rules. We used to have a grade above a C average. Which was not a hard grade to sustain. You could do minimum work to get the grades to keep it above a C average and if you didn't keep that grade you couldn't play sports or other scholastic activities. Many people may think change the C average to A b averaged is a bad thing but i personally think it is a good thing.

There are many ways you could look at the change in what your grade average must be to stay in your scholastic activities. One way you could look at it is there are many Positives to it. For instance school is a Place for learning not playing sports or other activities. They are extra for you on top of your schooling. And schooling must come first before anything else. By changing it to a B average the Kids that were doing the minimum amount of work they could do for the grade of a C average Now have to do more work. Which will help them through life. Many of the kids that wouldn't take school seriously they were just there to play sports and figured they didn't really have to learn they could just grow up and become a professional athlete or anything of that nature now they have to work and learn to be in the sports. As may some of the kids become professional athletes of some sort the other ones that did minimum work and may not find a job as an athlete just lost there whole schooling career will now not have a job. But by you making them learn and get good grade you gave them a Back up on there life. If the first plan doesn't work now they at least have a good education that will help them find a good place to work.

Some of the kids may say that making them have a grade of a b average is stupid and is hard to obtain. Many Kids are capable of have a grade of that if they would just try. That the problem they don't try or the would have a B average already. I honestly cant see Any Negatives for me. Yes it will be more work to obtain a B average but you a perfectly capable. It may be hard for some kids that have trouble in school. And i am sure that you would be willing to work with them and help them figure out a solution. But many of the kids that have a problem of the grade average being raised from a C to a B just don't want to work hard in school. They feel they should just be able to come to school relax hang out with friends and do minimum work to keep them on the sports team. They don't realize the disadvantages to there choices. They wouldn't have realized them till they are much older and are unable to find a job because they cant do the skills other people learned in 7th grade. But by you making them obtain a B average to do scholastic activities you made them realize school is more then just coming doing minimum work and playing sports but its learning life skills and looking out for your future .

Changing the rule from having a C average to a B average may seem like a lot of kids are not for it, but in the long run they will be thankful you did it. They will realize that you did it so the would know how to do stuff later in life then just do extra sports activities.

So don't let people tell you anything different. Changing the grade policy was the best thing you could have done for the student body of our school.
