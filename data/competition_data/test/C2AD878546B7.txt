Cars have become an extravigant part of our daily lives, to helping us with transportation or just taking us out for a ride out in the city. They have made their ways into our world.. But are they truly helping us and our enviornment.?

Out in Vauban, Germany- Residents of an upscale community, and other grand cities all around the world have given up one of mankinds best teleportation invention: You guessed it... their auto-mobiles.

In one of the excerpts from

"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."

the city of Vauban's streets they have officially gone "car-free" - except for some of the main thoroughfare, in which the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not whatsoever own any cars at all, and 57 percent of the residents here have sold their car just to move here. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." she quotes. Middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. That, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are now responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 52 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. "All of our development since World war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change." said an official of Transportation America, David Goldberg. In tghe United States, the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promorting "car reduced" communitites, and legislators are starting to act cautiously.

Other cities are also starting to take after Vauban. After many days of near- record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving banm to clear the air of the global city and are trying to have a smog free city.

In the excerpt

"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."

by Andrew Selsky. Bogota, Colombia has taken noticed also an has a program that's set to spread to other countries as well as theirs. It was the third staright year in which they have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day without cars in their capital city of 7 million people. Their goal for doing this event for a day is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog as well. As for the United States of America some people have take a toll for this ambitious goal in other countries that has left many researchers ponderwing a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving? Researchers say in American Behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewwer licenses as each year goes by. But as of April 2013 the economy has been able to risen and now many people can start buying new cars. Part of the reason why driving sessions were decreasing was because residents could not afford cars, and unem[ployment were't going to work. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downtuern and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. Only the next few years will be telling how our enviornmental world will be.

As for this, depriving cars out of the road can lead to a free smog envionrment where more people can be healthier and think smart about their world, and it might just actually help keep the planet clean and other ideas like getting rid of cars for good. Only we can lead how our future generations will view this world, so why not benefit earth instead of destroying it...?
