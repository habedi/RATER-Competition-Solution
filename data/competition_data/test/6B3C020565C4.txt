To the Principal,

I know you are having problems choosing policies for with students having their cell phones. I can help to come to a solution, that's better for your school, and your students. If you pick one of the policies, then I hope you made the right decision.

Cell phone usage is common for this generation of youth. I honestly say that I have a cell phone. And If i were you Mr./Mrs. Principle, then i would have to choose policy one. Because if the students want their cell phones, then they should have at some kind happiness to where they can use them during lunch, or other free times, instead of not having them at all. As far as that, I believe it is good for the school, and the students. I like the idea for students not having there cell phones on during class. Because it can go off anytime, and it will disturb other students learning. If students don't choose to follow this rule, you can give them some kind of consequence.

I believe policy one is also good , because it might be a emergency at the school and other students might be using the school's phone, and they can just pull out their phone, and can call their parents or whomever their legal guardian . Emergencies like a fire, tornado, flood, earthquake, or somebody up to no good on the school grounds.

I hope I helped you really well, and you can make a good decision based on what I've told you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
