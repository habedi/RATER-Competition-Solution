Every summer students are assigned projects that can be boring and hard to complete. A large number of the schools that require students to complete these projects have teachers design them. Some believe teachers designing summer projects is the best option for students; however, this is not true. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed.

There are multiple reasons summer projects should be student-designed. Every student has a different way they spend their summer break. An option that could benefit students would be one catering towards their events throughout their summer vacation. Students having a project about what they specifically participated in over the break could make the project more authentic. Many students have different summer vacation schedules. Some students may relax in their bedroom and play video games all summer; on the other hand, there are students who live for the summer. Students who live for the summer could perhaps visit: beaches, amusement parks, music festivals, perhaps even other countries. Along with what students do in their free time many teens start summer jobs which can also take up a good amount of time. A student-designed project would be easier on students because it'd work in their favor as well as be completed on their schedule. Each individual student has a different way of completing work. Certain teacher-designed projects may not be catered towards a students preferredÂ method of working. Some students may like to write essays or create posters, while some may like to make video montages or create other types of projects. Student-designed projects would give students the best opportunity to create something showing off how they like to work.

There are additional reasons why summer projects should be designed by students. If students designed their own projects they'd be more motivated to finish them. Since students would make their own project's the work would be more engaging and exciting. A goal one makes for themselves is wanted to be achieved more than a goal set by others. A student-designed summer project would be easier to complete. Teacher-designed assignments can often be confusing or difficult, driving students away from completing these assignments. However, if a student designs their project they'll know how and what to include making it easier to complete. Students have young, developing, as well as creative brains. Their minds would allow them to design their own projects, leaving the door open for unique work to be done. Creative projects being done in the summer turn on both sides of a students mind having logical and artistic work be done. If students engage both sides of their brain throughout summer break it puts them in a good spot to return to their school in the fall.

Although some may disagree, summer break projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects allow students to show:creativity, time management and the ability to work with busy schedules, self-motivation to complete their assignments, along with other benefits. Still some believe summer projects should be teacher-designed; however, this is not true. Summer projects being student-designed would be beneficial to students and open up many possibilities for their work to be its best over the break.
