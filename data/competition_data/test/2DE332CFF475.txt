Dear Mr. Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, and the reason for my letter is to persuade you to not follow through with the sports rule such as the grades. For example, requiring all b' s and above to be able to play in a sport or after school activity. I do believe that it is a very wrong thing to do and is un fair. I do believe this is because the average for a student such as my and age and others is a c, and by you requiring something higher then such is just plain un constitutional. I also feel that by doing this you are making people look down upon them selves as stupid, because some people who try there best can only get a d or e and they might be really good at sports ,but by you requiring such a high grade you are taking away some of there rights. Also, by you making such a decision you are increasing obesity. For example , if the average of the students grades are a c by you requiring a b ,since that isn't the majority that means only a small amount of people are getting active and healthy and in shape there for proving my point of obesity. Also, its not very fair that a majority doesn't get to do this either there fore that also proves my point of being un constitutional. So in conclusion please don't follow through with this horrible decision.
