The "Unmasking the Face on Mars" is just a natural landform and not a face made by aliens. The reason for me saying this is because it states that it is a Mesa. According to the text it was formed by a huge rock that formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. I also say that each picture being taken could of had a better quality camera or maybe could've had a different angle that makes it look like a face is there. As it said in the text the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds just to see that it was a face. The clouds could have given shadows that made it looked like there was a face imprint. The face could've been just another Martian mesa, in the text it says mesas are common around Cydonia. NASA decided to make this public which made more people believe this is real . All this was made so people could believe there is life on Mars, after scientist had believed there was life on Mars. Once they decide to take more pictures years later ,they found out it was just a natural landform.
