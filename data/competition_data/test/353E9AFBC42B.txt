Dear principal,

I think that community service is a great learning process learning how to treat you whole community. I think of it to be a extra course to learn how to help the environment as a whole also to make are home a healthier and safer place for us to live in.

If you are driving down the highways you see so much trash that is dangerous for animal all around us I think that it is sad that people think that it is fine to throw trash anywhere the want. For example I went to the outer banks for thanksgiving this past year. I was walking along the beach and saw trash everywhere mind you this was my last day there at the beach to relax and have fun. But when I saw how much trash was all over the beach I decided to start picking trash up and to help the environment. The reason I did this was not because I love animals so much but to see what happens to the animals like the plastic can holder thing that hold 6 cans around a bird that neck because he thought it was food ,or that birds think little stirefoam and plastic pieces is food and they soon die from the plastic that ends up in side them to me that's not right for animal to die because of what we leave behind.

There are many examples of how this can work or how we can help like:

* Pick trash up around school grounds

* When your on vacation pick trash up u see even if its not yours

* Really anywhere you see trash senserialy,
