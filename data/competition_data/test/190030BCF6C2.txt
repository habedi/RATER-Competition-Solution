There is not a good reason to put these Coding Systems into classrooms. The coding systems probably cost a lot of money and it would distract the students from focusing in the classroom. These Coding Systems aren't educational, they're used for the fun and enjoyment. So what's the point of puting these in classrooms? The Coding Systems won't teach them anything, it will just distract them.

The only way they could be beneficial is to study the muscles that're in your face. But studying this topic would only last for not even a month. They would be used once a year. So why have them when you'll only use them once a year?

There is something that can be used that is simpler and not as expensive to study this. There are still textbooks and certain handouts teachers can use to teach the students. That is how teachers are teaching now and students are already getting good grades so there isn't really a point of getting these Coding Systems.
