Dear Principle,

I don't think it is a good idea to not let kids exercise or play sports just because their average grade is lower than a B. It is obvious that some people have more brawn than brain and vice-versa. Me and many other students see it as an unfair decision and think that we should be able to play anyway. One person could get a scholarship because of their intellect while others might get something like a foot ball scholarship. It is very important to notice the differences between people even if the look alike.

I would like to know how came up with this idea, as it seems unjust to let this happen. Personally I don't play sports but I don't agree with this change and neither does the school board as they know that we need to have time to exercise and let our brains function properly, don't you agree. I would say if a child has a low grade than they may acquire a tutor to help them in specific class. But they may not be aloud to play sports if they cannot follow the rules or play fairly. I see this as a reasonable decision. I believe it would be in the schools best interest to put up a petition to see if your choice is allowed to be part of the school policy.
