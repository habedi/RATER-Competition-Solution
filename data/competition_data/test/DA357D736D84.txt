In the article the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represents. Studying Venus is a difficult challenge that NASA is trying to achieve. NASA is trying to create an aircraft that will last long in venus's environment conditions. They have a aircraft that is made out of silicon carbide that will last about 3 weeks.

and other scientist believe that venus was once like earth, they believed that there was once water and living oganisms. Due to the planet being so close to the sun, and the sun being as hot as it is the temperature of the planet is average 800 degrees fahrenheit. The planet now has a rocky sediment, valleys, mountians, and craters.

Also from the planet being so hot the aircrafts that had been made for venus wouldn't last very long. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experence on our own planet. The aircraft must be strong enought to support itself and not be crushed. "even a submariene accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans would be crushed and would liquefy many metals.

Not only is venus very hot and has a greater atmospheric pressure, the weather and natural diasters are dangerous. Venus often has "erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface."

Going to venus would be a very diffuicult for scientist to achieve. The aircraft that they built would only last about 3 weeks. The temperature on the planet is average 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atomic pressure is 90 times greater than is is on earth. The Weather on venus is also very dangerous.
