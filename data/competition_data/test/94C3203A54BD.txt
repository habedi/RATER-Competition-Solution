Dear Principle.

I think having the phone on free time is better then no phones at all because what if there is something wrong with someone in your family and you want to call your family and check on that person who is either sick or has a broken bone.

Also what if there is an emergency and your parent's have called u when your phone was off and left u a voice message and u got it when u turned your phone on and said someone in your family is either hert or died and they wanted to tell you as soon as posable so they don't want u mad at then when u get home because they didn't tell you or picked u up from school.

Another thing would be if u have an dentist appointment or and doctor appointment and your parents need to tell u they are going to pick you up from school early.

Another reason why i think we should have phones on our free time in school is what if your parents didn't want to call the school and have like the principle or the office secretaries tell you because maybe it was something that no body needed to know about but you and your family.
