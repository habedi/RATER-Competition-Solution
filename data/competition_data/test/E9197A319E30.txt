Do we depend to much on cars? the answer back in 2003 would have been yes.. yes we do, but as of recently car usage and production has slowed down considerably. In some countrys there are days were people dont use cars at all. Theres even a whole community/neighborhood thats placed a ban on all driving and car ownership.

Much of this change was caused by a need to reduce pollution rates and to cut down on green house gasses. And the change has helped places like paris and europe cut down on smog and other such pollutants. This will also help the ocean which has become largly devoid of the life that survived there afew years ago due to carbon pollution.

Yes we did use to many vehicals afew years ago. No we are not using so much anymore. Will this reverse global warming? who can tell? but we can at least try.
