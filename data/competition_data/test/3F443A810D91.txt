To Principal:

I think is not a good idea because, students wants to be in sports and activities , and all most of the students don't have a grade B .

I think it would be better if they have a grade C , because , in that way the students can be in sports, activities and they can study too.

I also think people can have sports so they can work out, and having a C

its good , because I think C is a good grade. Some moms wants a higher grade, but sometimes the sports distract us from studying. But i think if we really care about the sports we will be better on studying because its important to us. And if we are good at studying we can enjoy sports.

The grade B , its to high and also a C its good for enjoy sports. And in some classes we are going to have a better grade then C, but in other classes that maybe we are not good at, we don't get it or understand , or just because we don't like it , we are going to have a D but if we really care about sports , i think we can do better then a D , we can try our best and get a least a C .

And that's why I'm against of requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities.
