Today, they're many different technological advancements happening. Some of the advancements are things like cures for cancer, others are simple as online shopping. Schools are also taking advantage of this same technology by promoting online learning as part of there educational programs. School is a must in a persons life and is most times done in a public school. Public schools are very beneficial to one's life, for they help grow someones personality, character ,and a persons life goals as they grow. Online schooling is a option for students, but learning in a classroom environment at a public school is impossible to outperform. Their are simple reasons that prove this: they're key in formation of important social skills, formulate a persons personality, and help a person become well rounded.

Social skills ultimately help students tremendously in life and help them accomplish simple, everyday tasks. Public school is where people learn these skills and utilize them everyday. After high school, these skills become more evident when trying to find a job or career. It's been proven that employers don't hire for someones certifications, but they look at the level of complexity in a persons social skills. Many people argue the fact that a online education is better for the student, but in reality they dont have the opportunity to build their social skills as the public school Students accomplish easily. Along with building social skills, schools are a tremendous help with helping a student formulate their personality.

Personality is what makes everyone different and unique as a human being. Most students find their friends, and start to build bonds, in school, that will benefit one for the rest of their lives. Friends simply help a student be happier, perform better, and it pushes them to do there best no matter the circumstance. These friends teach one another lot about themselves, and help one anthoer to find there true inner self, their values, and sense of humor. These Qualities are almost impossible to find in a student that takes classes online because they simply cannot grasp friendship. This is mostly because of their lack of being around peers of the same age. Sadly, the online kids dont understand the full school experience either.

The total school experience is one you cant find anywhere else other than a public school. One learns about school spirit and pride: the pride of knowing your school has done well in a sporting event, or the spirit show on homecoming week. These are beneficial to the lives of students in a public school. The experience learned here does not stop at the end of one's schooling, for it can be translated for everyday life. it cant also be utilized to further your future in your career of choice. Online students miss this experience because when their class is done all they remember was being on the computer at home. most times they will only do what they have to do just to pass. The public school atmosphere can't be overcome by the people suffering because of their online schooling.

In conclusion, their are many life lessons that can be learned in public school that will benefit ones future. Simple day to day social skills, and friendships are valuable experience that cant be found anywhere other than public school. This shows that life isnt about the grades of test, but about the lessons learned. Experience is the best teacher that anyone could have because we learn as we obtain it. This shows that online schooling isn't a viable option for students that are serious about their education, and that want to succeed quickly in a career field.
