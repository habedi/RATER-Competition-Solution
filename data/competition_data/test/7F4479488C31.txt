Dear Principle,

I don't think that you need at least a B average to play a sport. Our grades don't and shouldn't effect our physical activities. Even if they did, you shouldn't need at least a B average because a lot of people aren't that smart. Not that many people would play sports and no one would be happy. If not that many people played sports, then the programs wouldn't make a lot of money. If they didn't make a lot of money or not a lot of people played then they would maybe have to close down, lowering the amount of money either the school or town gets. It would ruin everything.

I think that students should be able to play sports or activities and have a "D or above" average. This should be a policy because our grades don't have anything to do with our life outside of school. Sports are activities we do for fun. School is for becoming smarter in life. If the sport is in a town league, then the schools aren't involved, so neither should grades be. Kids should have the right to play and have fun, no matter how smart they are. If the sport is part of the school, then grades matter, but the policy should be a C average or higher. If the sport is part of the school, grades matter a little bit more than a town sport but it should only be if you're failing. If your failing then you'll need a lot of time to catch up and won't be able to play a sport. If your not failing, then you deserve to play a sport and have do what you want.
