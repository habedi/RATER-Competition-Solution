Dear Principal,

Cell phones should be allowed in schools, but only in the lunch periods and other free times. For certain reasons, some students forget work at home and they need there parent to bring it to school for them. If there parents are able to bring there work then the student wouldn't get a missing assignment or project. A reason why they shouldn't be allowed in classrooms is that they could cheat on a test.

Students feel more comfortable when they have there phone, I know that I feel more in touch with my parents and friends. Lets say there is a family emergency, or soccer practice got cancelled its a nice thing to know ahead of time so you can schedule out your homework, or after school plans. You cant stop students to not have there phones someone is going to use it. Even if schools try to enforce the "no cell phone rule" there will be students secretly using it.

Cell phones these days have the latest technology on them. You can check your email, grades that are online , and also the internet so its easy to look up an answer to a test . Cell phones are almost just like computers. They should DEFINATLY not be allowed in the classroom, me being a student and having to not use my cell phone is a struggle. Every student can go with out 6 hours without one though, and ever so often when your in the halls or at lunch you get to take a glace at your phone.

I vary with both sides of this argument. If you allow them to have it in the halls and lunchroom, the school would be more "loved" by the students that go to school there. Its also not a good thing for students to be cheating on tests. I think if you could have cell phones allowed but only for emrgency, or if your really need to use it, but should only be used in the halls or at lunch .In this case i agree with having students being allowed to have there cell phones, but are limited to where they can use them.
