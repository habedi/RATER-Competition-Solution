In today's society, people all over the world are practically glued to their phones. Compared to when cell phones first came out, technology has evolved into an important item that we carry. You can do everything from buying music, paying bills, buying gifts, even completing homework on a cell phone. Even though cell phones has become one of the most useful tools that we use, sometimes we need to know when to put it away. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it can lead to horrific accidents, the consequences could be expensive, and in the long term it effects everyone.

Cell phone usage is the number one cause of auto death and/or injury. "Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver." (National Center for Statistics and Analysis) 1 Even if you are not on your phone while driving, someone else could be and you could easily become a statistic. Teen drivers are more than likely to get into car accidents because of the constant use of the phone. We can bring the number of deaths down but putting our phone away.

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use your phone while driving. If you are caught on your phone while driving, you will receive a ticket. These tickets can cost between $50-$2,750 depending on the number of offenses and type or driver. According to drivinglaws. org, "Depending on the circumstances, a texting or cellphone violation could also lead to a reckless driving conviction. And if one of these violations results in the death of another person, vehicular homicide charges are a possibility." Although there are some expectations to using your phone such as reporting traffic accidents, medical emergencies, fires, criminal activity, or serious road hazards, it is safe to use your phone only for emergencies and nothing else.

I can honestly say that everyone that I know has been effected by a car accident. Although I never been in one, my sister has been in an awful car accident and it has affected her mentally and physically. She has scars on her head which affects her self-esteem, she gets nervous while driving sometimes, and at the time of the accident, she needed help eating and getting dressed which caused the whole family stress. Just imagine if you caused someone to die just because you had to send a text message. How would you live with that? Car accidents can cause PTSD, adjustment disorder, depression, driving phobia, neurological damage, and substance abuse. This can affect not only the person who was injured in the accident, but it can affect the driver who caused the accident.

It is never that serious to put your life or anyone else's life in dangers because of a text, call, or social media. It is not worth the money and stress to be on your phone and drive. There are stands made for your phone that you can use in the car that way your hands can be on the steering wheel at all times. There are also bluetooth headphones you can use so your hands can be on the steering wheel as well. In my opinion, the best option is to put the phone in the glow compartment, purse, arm rest, or wherever in the car you cannot reach. There are no positive outcomes from using your cell phone while driving, it can only lead to disasters.
