For years and years, the act of receiving an education has been offered to students through attending school. Recently, there has been a new trend called "distance learning." This type of education allows a student to obtain an education by way of online classes and video conferencing. Many do not support distance learning due to believing a student's social time will be limited. However, distance learning would benefit a student by allowing them to learn in a comfortable environment such as their room, encouraging more sleep by allowing them to pick their own school hours, and providing a healthy alternative to education when it comes to being sick or illnesses.

To begin with, often times the most dreaded parts of a student's school day are the huge crowds, slow-paced hallways, and loud noises. Students who suffer with anxiety or those who are always on edge can be intimidated by these factors. These minor infractions could potentially prevent the proper education for a student by either being a distraction or placing them in a situation they are not comfortable with. If school systems were to implement distance learning, students would be able to attend class from the comfort of their own bed or relaxing spot within their own home. Students who feel comfortable in their working environment are more likely to care and maintain the work they are required to participate in. For example, a student who has a fear of public speaking and presenting in front of a class may skip out on a presentation assignment in order to avoid an awkward speaking encounter. Although, with distance learning, the student instead could present their project through video conference with their teacher and receive the same grade as if they were physically in class. All in all, distance leaning benefits students by placing them in more comfortable school related situations.

Continuing on, sleep should be a key factor in every person's life. However, adequate sleep is what many students struggle with due to juggling excessive homework with after school activities and family time. For example, an involved student is given a strict daily schedule which often includes going to school from 8:30am-3:30pm and then attending a two hour event afterwards for a club or sport. By the time the student arrives home and finishes their homework, it can be extremely late into the evening allowing for minimal sleep. On the contrary, students involved with distance learning are granted permission to choose which hours they clock in and do their online work required for a class. Whether this means sleeping in and working throughout the afternoon, or waking up early in order to get to bed at a decent time that night, distance learning provides more flexible hours for students to complete their daily school assignments. Overall, responsible students who take advantage of the more relaxed school day hours through online school and distance learning should experience a benefit within their sleep schedule and habits.

Lastly, the number one priority of a school is to provide a safe learning environment for students attending. However, when the flu season or something similar comes around, schools can sometimes be some of the most dangerous places to attend. With massive amounts of students and germs, catching a cold or getting sick can often be inevitable. By participating in distance learning during a flu or cold outbreak, a student can acquire their daily information without the risk of getting sick from their peers. Distance learning also benefits students on the other end of the scale as well. For example, many students attend school while they are still ill in order to not miss tons of work. Even though these students have good intentions, they are essentially putting others in harms way by spreading their germs around the school. The sick student could instead stay home from school and make sure they do not miss any work by participating in distance learning. The student could have a personal conversation by video conferencing with their teacher and ask what they need to do in order to stay caught up and then have that work completed by the time they are healthy and ready to attend school again. In the end, distance learning benefits students by ensuring a healthy school environment and allowing students who are temporarily sick to keep up with their work all while in the comfort and care of their own home.

In conclusion, distance learning benefits students by allowing them to learn in a comfortable environment such as their room, encouraging more sleep by allowing them to pick their own school hours, and providing a healthy alternative to education when it comes to sickness. Students who participate in online school will experience higher grades due to distance learning being accommodating to every aspect of a student's life. Distance learning should be implemented in more schools throughout the world because it has many benefits that can help all different types of students.
