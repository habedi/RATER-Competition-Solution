I feel as if everybody should be in a club or on a sports team or at least just engaging themselves with something else instead of regular old school. I agree with my principal with making it so students have to participate in a least one extracurricular activity because, everybody needs something to do outside of school. You can join a club and meet new friends and new people, you can find things that you like to do that you never even knew you liked.

Every kid needs to be doing outside of school, i heavily suggest sports for kids, more importantly a team sport. Being on a team sport teaches you how to be a leader and a team player. At the same time you are getting great exercise that your body needs. Kids need to be kids and having them play sports is a great way to let them go and be kids. You learn a lot of valuable life lessons when you play a sport, some that might stick with you your whole life. Also kids doing something like playing sports or volunteering somewhere can help from get kids off the streets getting involved with drugs and committing crimes.

Besides sports and doing things outside of school, another great way to get into and extracurricular activity is joining a club. Joining a club could be beneficial for someone who has a hard time making new friends. If you join a club you might find yourself interested in something you never even knew that you liked. Say you have a hard time making new friends, if you join a clubs that has to do with something that you really like you are bound to find some new friends because you are surrounding yourself with other people who have the same interests that you do. Also more schools should have more variety of clubs and things to do after school to make school a more enjoyable place.

Another great thing about participating in extracurricular activities is that you can find new hobbies that you like that you never even heard of or that you've never tried. If your not sure if you should join that club or play that sport just do it, because if you don't and you realize what could've been a good experience is thrown away because you did not want to try anything new. It's okay to step out of your comfort zone every now and then. It may be fun or it may not, you just got to find yourself and what you like, experimenting with things is great for you. Don't second guess yourself, the more you second guess the more your talking yourself out of doing it.

In conclusion it should be schools jobs to make sure kids are putting themselves in clubs and sports etc. to succeed and have a better life. I highly agree with my principle making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity inside and outside of school, my principle needs a raise.
