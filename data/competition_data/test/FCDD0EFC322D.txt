Walking around in the rain, something most people wouldnt do often was brought together when a city banned cars for a day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

Cars are needed in daily life but limmiting their uses from now and then would help emprove the life expectancy of our Earth.

France has high levels of smog due to their use of diesel more then gasoline. These high levels would be lowered once the use of cars are limited. The use of driving can be limited in multiple was, such as the use of internet or cell phones. Whie these devices can only give you the feeling of talking to one another, it is a very great way to reduce emmision levels.
