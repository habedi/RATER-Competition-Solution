Dear TEACHER_NAME:

Imagine the world turning into an immense pile of trash. Community service is required in BETA Club, but I believe that every student in our school should take a stand and help our community by doing service hours. By doing service hours everyone in the school will be able to make new friends, find a way to occupy themselves, and keep our earth clean.

Community services allows many people to interact with others. Our school should require service hours to each and every student because everyone will be able to benefit from this. Whether it is assisting handicap children or picking up trash, the volunteers will be able to communicate with their surrounding. The students will have a friendly connection with everyone who is involved and will be able to complete tasks that are assigned to them. Meeting new people and helping out with our community is always a good feeling.

Finding a real job for teenagers under the age of fifteen is nearly impossible. Some students are able to work for what they strive for and I am determined to create a healthy and welcoming environment for our school. Some students who have a hard time in a certain class should be able to sign up for tutoring. Keeping students occupied with school work will help them in the future. It only takes about fifteen minutes to and hour to complete one community service, depending on the task that is assigned.

I encourage everyone to find a healthy hobby for our community, such has recycling to help keep our planet looking better than ever.

Our Earth is filled with trash on the ground and students who are lazy tend to leave their papers on the floor. The best thing to do is provide service hours for our school so it will look fresh and clean. We shouldn't have to have janitors coming into every classroom and hurting their backs just to clean up our mess. Junior high students should be more responsible and mature enough to pick up our own trash.

Community service is a fun way to help out with the community. I encourage you to require service hours to every student in the school. There is no negative results from this and it won't hurt to help other students with their homework or pick up trash to prevent a mess. Our earth will be clean, we'll be able to find a new friend, and it's a great way to keep us busy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
