Phones and Driving

Phones and techknowledgey have changed a lot through our time. We have had a major impact with phones from being able to call wherever your at and having having access to the internet on your phone. There have been positive and negative effects. One major negative effect is drivers being able to be on their phones while driving a car. Many people feel the need to get that last text off or need to get that quick phone call in at a red light. Sounds quick and simple but this is very dangerous. This is dangerous do to the fact that people can get into car wrecks due to the fact they are worrying about their phone at that moment.

People forget that the road is shared with other people and that it is shared with other people being on there phone. The National Safety Council have estimated 1.6 million car crashes due to phones and nearly 400,000 injured. This is caused by that one text you have to get off or picture that your friend posted you have to like. This isn't only caused by teens this is also caused by parents. But many people have to use there phone wherever there at. Such as businessmen and lawyers. Because of what they due they have be able to answer the phone wherever there at because of their job. But however this is hazardous because of the fact this is more riskier.

People have invented and a new way of answering the phone with a touch screen cars and voice hearing cars. Not only that there have been bluetooth headphones and car tripods. This has had a big impact on car crashes and helping people do stuff without having to grab their phones and loose attention of the road. A lot of hands free stuff is helping it to. Many laws have tightened up on this. If getting caught in certain states such as Georgia you will get in trouble. Under the age of 18 is prohibited for drivers with permits and class-d licence.

You have to be safe on the road because of the law and car crashes. Even if your not the one on your phone that doesn't mean the person behind you is not. Driving is dangerous and everyone should take precaution when driving. People will drive while being drunk or any other reason. Even with the laws that are not going to stop some people from doing it. As a society we should stop and take a chance to prevent anything harming to others because of the fact that we don't know who is all in the car.
