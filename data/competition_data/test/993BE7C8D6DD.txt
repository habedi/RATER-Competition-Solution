Have you ever wanted to go around the world or see it. Well now you can with the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to go all around the world and ride waves, and boats and see a hole nother adventue wanting to happen. You can also invite a friend to come on the trip, it well be a opportunity of a lifetime. You will have a blast if you join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You also won't have to worrie about the Pacific War, so you well be salf if you were travel.

If you are woundering where well you be going, you well going to 9 different countries. Now that sounds like fun but if you don't like traveling than I say don't join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you well be travel alot 9 countries and it takes time to get to those countries. It takes a month to get to China and two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

It also takes resonpablies, becasue you take care of animals. World War II just endend and we have to help out the countries that got ruin by World War II there 44 nations that joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation). Did I say you get to take care of hores, young cows and mules.

When you are apart of the Seagoing Cowboys you get to help out people and have fun doing it. You also get to travel to Greece. You can also go on a cattle-boat trip so like fun. so i hope you are thinking about
