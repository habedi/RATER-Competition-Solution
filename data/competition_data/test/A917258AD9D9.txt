Have your parents ever forced you to go out and do something because they say you're wasting your life away? If so then you probably also know that it is not fun or enjoyable at all when you're made to do it. So when you are obligated to join a club and or do an extracurricular activity it won't be something most people are exited to do because some people just might not have enough time on their hands, they may have no interest in the activities available, and when something like that is forced upon them they may lose interest in something that they would have loved or even pursued in the future.

First off the school doesn't know what every student does after school, and if they did that would be weird, so why should they make after school activities a requirement. A good majority of the students have things they do after school whether it be practice for city league sports, looking after their parents shop, and even the copious amounts of homework they may have been assigned. Some students just don't have the spare time to do these after school activities and making it required would just add onto the stress and imbalance of their schedule.

Another problem could be that the students have no interest in the options given to them or they offer no value to what the student wants to pursue in life. Because when five out of the seven options available are sports and you don't like sports or you want to do something that isn't related to sports like engineering then you got a problem. You wont get the skills you need for what you want to do and well your not interested.

Lastly it could cause them to lose interest in something that they otherwise would have loved to do. For example imagine that soccer is your favorite sport and you enjoy playing it a lot but it's not the only thing you enjoy, but because you like it, it gets shoved down your throat every day and your being forced to do it competitively so it went from something you enjoyed and did every so often to something you hate and never want to do again all because it was forced upon you.

In conclusion I don't think that schools should require after school activities because some students may not have the time to do them, they might not have an interest in whats offered, and they could get tired or bored with something they enjoy all because it was forced. Also if an after school activity is required from every student then it's not really after school anymore it just becomes an extension of school time.
