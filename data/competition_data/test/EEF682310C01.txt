When giving students free roam with projects they are more likely to complete it proving that, giving students student- designed projects is beneficial. Students want to learn but, they would rather learn about things that intrigue them rather than basic studies. So if teachers are going to assign a project for the summer, have it be a project that five students freedom.

School takes up the majority of the year, which means students have a heavy work load for most of the year. There is no lie in saying that school is stressful and can be very hard on some students. So a few months off of school gives them time to go out and have fun while learning more about themselves rather than school. Giving a student a teacher- designed and enforced project, is going to give students a bad attitude towards school. The project seems forced upon, no student is going to want to complete or feel motivated to complete an assignment that was pushed upon them.

A lot of students would take an average project and get it over with but, there is a big number of students who would never end up getting to it. Motivation is hard to grasp for a lot of students. These are the students who would look at a summer assignment and think ' I have so much time to get this done, I'll do it later' and then never think of it again, let alone complete it. Students motivation in the summer is especially low, they are in vacation mode which is for the most part, stess free. Giving students a teacher- designed project will give them little to no motivation in doing it but, giving them a student- designed project could give them the motivation to complete it.

If students are assigned student-designed projects they can experience something new for themselves while also learning. They have free roam to decide what interests them and what they want to learn. Nobody wants to use their free time to learn about something they don't care for, but they will if it's something they can be passionate about. Students not only get to learn something new but get to learn new things about themselves. Having to find something that interests them can give them new hobbies or passions that they can pursue.

All in all, It is more beneficial to give a student room to improve on their own and decide what they would like to do.Â
