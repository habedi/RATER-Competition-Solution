Do you think you could live without a car? In some cities across the world people dont even use cars. Being car free is a good idea because it reduces the level of polution in the enviroment and it saves resources.

To begin with, being car free would be better off because it reduces the level of polution. For example,"Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals" as stated by Robert Duffer in the article "Paris bans driving due to smog". Paris made a driving ban that fined different drivers on certain days going by their liscence plate numbers. This law caused the smog to clear just enough for the French to uplift the ban. Another example of where being car free reduced polution is in Bogata, Columbia. Where anually they'd go a day without cars. "Violators faaced $25 fines." quoted from Andrew Selsky's article, "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota". Business man Calos Aruro Plaza said on that day,"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Finally being car free is a good idea because it reduces the amount of pollution put into the air.

In conclusion, in order to reduce pollution and save resources more cities should think about being car-free.
