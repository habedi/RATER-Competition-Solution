Dear senator

Im am wrighting a letter to you In hopes that you will change the way we ineletion to change it to populart vote for the president of the united states. In election, for example, obama had received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3. this means to me thatif we like someone we can mostly end up having them our president. Flordia for the electoral votes given to each state. Flordia only have a 29 for electoral votes. Yes some people might say that is a lot but if we were to do it on populart votes it would be more fair to the other state. For example rode island on have 3 how is electoral votes fair for them? In 2000, when gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless obama who won that vote got 29 electoral votes.
