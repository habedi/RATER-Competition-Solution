Cell phones are one of the biggest new technologies, and a great way to communicate. From your phone you can access your email, make calls to people around the world or send a simple text message. You can also download music, and play games. But still the question is. Should kids be allowed to use them during school?

Yes, I believe that kids should be allowed to use their phones during lunch, or whatever free time they have. During class, not so much. If that was the case, kids would be cheating on homework, assignments and tests. Also, the kids would not be as focused on their schoolwork as they should be. But, during free time they should be allowed to have them. For example. Lets say that a kid has a basketball game after school and when he gets to school, he finds out he left his shoes at home. During the next free time or lunch he could make an urgent call to his mom or dad so he could get them before the game starts.

Also, kids need social time. It's what they do. Socialize. Some kids maybe have friends from other cities, or towns. Cell phones are a great way to talk to your friends if you don't see them on a daily basis. Lastly, students need to use cell phones. It's part of our lives here in the twenty-first century. Sometimes you just need a little down time to talk to someone, listen to music, or just play games. That's why I think cell phones should be allowed during lunch or free time.
