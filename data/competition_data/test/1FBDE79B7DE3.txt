Dear Principal,

I believe that students with a grade C average should be able to play school sports. This new policy is unwanted by most of the school, as a large amount of the students have a C average and would be unable to play sports.

The amount of students with C averages is proof they are having trouble with their schoolwork or in a particular class. A C average is also a passing grade, so they are not in trouble with their grades by any means. Students should not have their favorite sport taken away because they struggle in school. I believe that they should be given extra assistance, but taking away this beloved sport is not fair to the students.

The school sports team may also become limited without some of the C students. Many students have fantastic sports skills, but do not have a similar skill in school. This policy would stop many prospering athletes from helping the team to victory. This would also keep C average athletes from even trying out for the team, regardless of their skill or talent. This B average policy is unfair and detrimental to the majority of the students in the school. Also, allowing C average students to play sports will give them one more reason to favor school.
