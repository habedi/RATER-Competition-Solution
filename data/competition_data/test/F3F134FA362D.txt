Schools often assign summer projects to prepare students for the upcoming school year and to ensure learning is continued throughout summer break. Summer assignment are very beneficial to students in many ways. But, at times students fail to complete these assignments. Summer projects should be student-designed because it makes the work more interesting for the student, it helps with motivation, and it can work better with students' busy summer schedules.

Students are often given summer projects from teachers that include countless hours of reading a book or filling out worksheets. These mindless tasks are often overlooked by students and are done in a rush in order to get them over with. Student-designed summer projects are more interesting to students because of how personalized the project could be. Students can research the history of the Caribbean country they are visiting, or write a research paper about summer jobs. The possibilities are endless and the personalization will spark more interest in many students. The project will also be more interesting because it will require the students to use creativity. Schools tend to neglect the importance in creativity and uniqueness in students, and a student-designed project will help with that. Students can use their own creativity to create a unique project that will work for them and their summer. Having an interesting project is important for summer assignments.

Motivation is an important factor in summer projects. Students lack the motivation to do projects deigned by teachers because they seem boring and students would rather spend time doing other summer activities during their break. A student-designed project is less like homework and will give students more motivation to do it.

A personalized project will make students want to work on it. Summer is the time when students want to forget about school and homework and a student-designed project will distract students from the fact that it is a school project. The project will also be more exciting and unique for the students. The assignment will not be the same for each student, this will give students motivation to finish their unique project. Most students have little motivation to do teacher-designed summer projects. But if it is student-designed, that problem will be solved.

Summer projects designed by students leave room for more flexibility. Teacher-designed projects tend to be forgotten about and ignored over the summer break. Students travel and have many things going on in their lives during the summer. A project designed by each student will be unique to their summer schedules. Summer plans will not be disturbed. With a student-designed project, it is almost guaranteed that the students will do it. The project will fit in with each students' individual lives better. This insures that more students will finish a quality project.

Summer projects are good for students and maintaining a learning attitude during the break. These projects should be student-designed. A student-designed project helps to keep students interested and motivated to complete their project. The flexibility of a student-designed project is significantly better for the overall learning of the student.
