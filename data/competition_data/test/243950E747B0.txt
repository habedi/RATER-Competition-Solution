In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a picture that looked like the resemblence of a human face. NASA showed the picture to the public and it definitely drew attention to Mars. Some conspiracy theorists believe that the Face Viking 1 found is evidence of life on Mars, but NASA later came out and said that the face was actually just a landform, a mesa. I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, a clearer picture confirms this, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and NASA wouldn't hide that life was found on Mars becuase it would benefit them.

The Face was not created by aliens, becuase a clearer picture taken in 2001 shows it's just a landform. In the article it states, "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa." NASA used their best equipment to make sure they would be accurate when discovering what the Face really was. Also, in the article it states, "And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." Sometimes when you see something at first it looks like something odd, but when you take a closer look it turns out to be something ordinary; that's what happened in this situation.

Another reason, why the Face wasn't created by aliens, is becuase it's just like any other landform. In the article it states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin." Like I said previously, the Face turned out to be a landform, and the landform itself isn't something specatacular, it's just an ordinary landform. It is something that is common, that just formed like the mountains and plateaus in North America today.

Finally, a formation created by aliens would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide that. If it was made by aliens and there really was life on Mars, wouldn't NASA be excited and telling the public about it, since it would promote their company? The answer is yes, they would, which is why I believe they are telling the truth that it is just a butte or mesa. The article states, "Some poeple think that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars." This proves my point that NASA would be be thrilled and want to tell everyone about life on Mars, if there really was.

In conclusion, I think the Face found on Mars was just simply a natural landform. There is more evidence that proves this than there is that proves it was made by aliens. Taking a closer look at it you can clearly tell it is just a landfrom, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and proof of life on Mars would benefit NASA, so they wouldn't hide that information. This shows why I believe the Face found on Mars is just a landform, and was not created by aliens.
