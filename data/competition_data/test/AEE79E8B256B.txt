If students were honest, they'd say summer is one of the worst seasons of all! For many, summer means spending time with family, a vacation in Generic_City, or having a cook out on 4th of July. Unfortunately students believe summer is comparable to being in class. Attending high school or college will always come with a heavy workload during each semester; but when the snow melts and the sun comes back to play there is a moment of relief. Now that the flowers are blooming, Sols are completed, and finals are finished, students have a chance to relax and enjoy all the amazing gifts summer has to offer. Sadly that chance is taken away when teachers demand elaborate summer projects. Allowing students to design their own projects would give them the time, balance, and creativity to complete the task their own way.

Most people have a tight schedule in the summer due to working and planned vacations. A majority of young scholars today work summer jobs throughout the entire break. When teachers assign these summer projects they do not consider students availability to complete it. There is not much time to write a five paged essay or create a 20 slide PowerPoint when you're in Generic_City with no internet connection. Having a constant active mind on school is draining. Students need the healthy inactivity that summer provides them for balance. If the opportunity were given to have more control of due dates during the summer, they could venture into being more personal in their assignments.

Nevertheless, some say teachers know what is best for every student and that they should have complete control because of their educational background. This is not the case that many believe to be true because every individual has their own way of learning. Whether that student is a slow reader or just has difficulties understanding what is asked for in an assignment. Given that students are not just another brick in the wall should be a factor to let students design their own projects. Allowing them to use their unlimited creativity to complete that simple, boring, and plain summer project would be spectacular.

If they have that power to work in their own style it could even encourage them to finish it faster and still have time for the summer fun. Summer is a time for letting loose so let students loose themselves in a project that they will actually enjoy. Having a project personally designed to your own liking would give students the time, balance, and creativity that they desire. Hopefully in the near future all schools will adapt this into a regular routine for students everywhere.
