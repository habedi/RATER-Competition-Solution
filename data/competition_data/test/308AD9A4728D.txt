I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because that picture of mona lisa smile it had some hard proof on what it does and what it would do.

In paragraph 4 it gives good details on why it should be used it states that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes Dr. Huang. " eventhough individual often show varying degrees of expression"(like not smiling as broadly). Using video imgery, the new emotion-recogition software track these facial movement - in a real face or in the painted face of mona lisa. By weighting the different units , the software can even identify mixed emotion (as in da vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

Now see that up there was really everything that caught my eye. it gave perfect everything. The claim for the value of using technology to read students emotional expressions.

But the real reason why i think that it would be good is because you can see if somebody having a good or bad day. now if its good then good but if its bad then you can know to leave them alone.

And then it also states in paragraph 9 that making a happy face can make you feel slightly happy.:"moving your fanial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help prodce them. ("putting on a happy face " actually works !) may happen beacuse we unconsciously imitate another person facial expressions. Its just all beautful to me we need one.
