Boom! Crash! Did you hear that ? That is the sound of a driverless car crashing into a car with an driver.

I think driverless cars are not safe and they will never be safe. What if something goes wrong? what if something goes so wrong to where they crash into cars and crash into buildings running people over because they went out of control. Then the inventor would be fined with all the damages and homocides his cars have done because he decided to be driverlesss. I would never condone or accept driverless cars because I feel something will go wrong. For example like the movie I robot with will smith remeber those robots were helpful and helping do alot but then something went wrong. I have watched alot of tv shows and movies where inventions like that went really wrong. Unless that car can jump over 2 of the tallest building in the city or transform into an autobot . I dont think any of us are safe and never will be safe with an car without an driver.
