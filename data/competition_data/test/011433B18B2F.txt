I am a scientist and I belivie that the Face on mars wasn't created by an alien. Looking at pictures I can see that the Face dosen't look like a human at all. In 1976 the Face was funny looking and later on in the years the Face blured out. It looks like a natural landform because people think just because it has eyes and a nose.

According to the arictle states the scientist belived the Face was an alien artifact. But I think how would you that it's an alien the world has so many different fetures, and creatures everywhere you may never know. Even though know ones probaly every seen an alien before. It may have been the shape or form they way the ground grew, and it just turn out to look like a face.

Then the found out on April 5,1998 that Micheal Mailn snapped a picture ten times finding out it was just a natural landform. I wounder why they thought that it was an alien. They got a camera on board to see if another may have poped up scientist checking it. If they would find one then it would be proof ,because now they have a camera on board to see.

I think that the rule of thumb is great because you can't discren things in to image 3 times bigger. It may look like something that it's not and apper wrong to look like an creature. What the picture actually shows is Martian equivalent butte and it and the Amercian West landforms are both in comman. It's a lava dome that takes form of a islated mesa looking ,and having same hieght of the Face on Mars.

I think that you shouldn't asume that something or someone is what it isn't. You always get facts and debate and reason more. And find out if your reascreah may have been wrong going thur the process. There mistake in the long run was making the image bigger than what it is was. I knew that it was a landform Face;because I don't belive in things like,vampires,zombie. Unsupernatural things unless there is facts clues evidence.
