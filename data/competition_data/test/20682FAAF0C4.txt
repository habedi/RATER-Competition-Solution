Is it a landform? There is a big thing over if the Face on Mars is just a landform or if it is alien related. As NASA is reseaching it and there is just threories over it. As NASA belives it is just a Natural Landform.

Yes indeed it is a landform NASA has found that it is just big rocks and shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. As the first pics can to the internet the JPL web site revealed a natural landform and there was not a alien monument after all. And the picture acually shows Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These are landforms common around the American West.

Yes there is theroies behind it being alien related but there is a lot of imformation that can back it up on it just being a natural landform. So I think NASA has solved the face on Mars just to be a natural landform.
