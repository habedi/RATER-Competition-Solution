In my opinion I don't think it is neccesary to use that type of technology in the class room because you can tell when someone isn't paying attention or if they're really bored just by their body language. You can tell a lot just by a persons body language or how they are acting.

In paragraph 5 it states that,"you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by look on her face". You can also tell how a person is feeling by their body language. If their head is down you might think they feel sick,tired, or they might not want to talk to anyone. It is east to tell when someone it feeling happy because when they are happy they stand up straight,have a smile on their face. A person's attitude can tell a lot about someone. For example if you can their name and the answer "what!" it can mean they are annoyed by someone or something. Another example can be when you're talking to someone and they answer you with no emotion on their face,and they slumped down in a chair can mean they are either tired and don't have any engery to do anything and maybe want some time to themselves.

My other reason why I disagree is that FACS might cost the school a lot of money. Instead of buying this technology why not buy more books or take field trips. Why buy something that might be used once rather than save the money and use it for soemthing good. Like buying better computer for the school or buying materials for the classes. If a student isn't paying attention instead of modifying the lesson like it states in paragraph 6. Why wont the teacher help the student after school instead of changing the lesson. It would help the student understand more and help him.
