I don't think the "Unmasking Face on Mars" is true or really believable. Okay so maybe in 1976 you could sorta see a face but as the years go on, the face fades away, so how would there still be life on mars or anything on mars for that matter. For one why would you believe everything you saw on a movie, tv show, or in a magazine. People right fake stuff all the time to get more views or ratings. People crave things that aren't true.

Nobody that is human has ever lived on mars or even walked on it.

There is not any scientific proof that anything is out in outer space. If people want to believe that there is life on mars, then I guess they are just going to go into outerspace themselves and take pictures of whats really going on up there so the whole world knows. There has not been one person who has visited all the planets, so no one can really give "facts" or imformation about space. There is still a lot to discover and a lot more to find out. For all we know aliens could be real or unicorns.

I think the ocean and outerspace have a lot in common because, they are like worlds of unknown living things. Hopefully one day someone will be able to explore all of outerspace and give us the real imformation and prove who is right and who is wrong. Just before you start giving out imformation to people make sure you know for a fact it's true. Also we all need to do a little research about everything. We barely know our left hand. So as I end this I would like to conclude that no one in the world really has the truth on whats really out there, we don't really know if there is life on mars or if it's just a bunch of crap people feed us to take our money.
