Dear, Principal

We should able to participate in sports and other activities if we have c average or not. Some reasons are like, Sports makes us forget to take of our minds off of things that have if we problems in school. Additionally some activities are hobbies or to make some new friends. Maybe we like to participate in sports to hang with our friends after school. We like to play sports here because this is where we could do exercise and have fun at the same time. We join activities because we are good a it and to do something new everyday. We play sports because we are really good at and we want to compete against other people. So please principal don't do this we all like to do new things everyday. Instead of watching television playing video games. We should be able to play a sport or do a activity even if we have a C average.

Sincerely,

Students
