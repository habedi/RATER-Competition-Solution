To the principal:

To many schools, a sports team is their main pride. Whether it be football or basket ball, girls or boys, they have brought joy and excitement throughout schools. It is also one of the reasons that let students show their school spirit and, as they say, root for their school.

Recently, you have changed our school policies about the requirements on being on a sports team . It said that you are insisting upon the qualifications of only students with

B average and above to be allowed to participate in sports or activities. It is obvious that most of the students in our school are C averaged. if you are to know this fact, then why did you not change it back, for it is unfair?

Although I agree that C average is quite low, it is not a failing grade. Rather, if you are afraid of the school's reputation, academically, then instead of just ruining the athletic part of it's reputation, we may be able to do something about it. if we can, than we could have extra classes for those who didn't understand anything. it doesn't have to be long, actually. it could be at least once a week. we may also have extra credit, for those who really need it. Maybe, there is a reason why that child is not doing well. We do have a guidance counselor in our school, so if one has any problem they can ask for help.

As said previously, the requirements for only B average and above students are cutting down most of the school's population, and with the chance that many B averaged students do not want to participate in extra-curricular activities, it could mean that not many people are on the team.

Keeping this in mind, we should know that with few players it is hard to participate, let alone play, in competitions and tournaments.

Also, I would like to clarify that students who are willing to participate in sports and activities must have some interest in it. It is not likely that a student would become part of a club or game that he/she is not happy with. As teachers, you should be able to help your children with being able to succeed. Is this helping ain any way possible? Helping a child achieve their goals and nourish them in their environment is a part of a teacher's requirement and with what you are demanding, it would not be possible. they would not learn necessary things in life, such as teamwork, the thought of succeeding, trying you best, being ok if they lost, etc.
