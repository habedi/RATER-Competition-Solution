Dear Principle,

I don't believe that removing students right to have cell phones is a smart thing to do. Although it may stop students from being distracted at school, it only stops them in that small way. There are still many other distractions that teachers need to worry about more. Students should be able to use cell phones during there free time, and just turn it off during class. It doesn't distract anyone, it allows students to socialize better, and it allows students to contact important people, such as there parents.

If students only use cell phones during lunch, after school, or at other free times, it won't be a distraction. Its about the same thing as not having a cell phone at school at all, except that they can use something they want to use when its an appropriate time. As long as they are not using there phones in class. Some of you may say that even though students aren't "allowed" to use them in class, some will still sneak a text or two. That if you get rid of cell phones completely at school, you won't have this problem anymore. Wrong. If you consider the fact of kids still using the phones in class, who's not to say that they won't still bring them to school anyways? Plus, cell phones aren't the biggest distraction in the world. Friends are more of a distraction. It's as if you took away their right to have friends.

With a cell phone, students have the ability to contact their friends more, and maybe they can get more friends too. Everyone knows that the more friends you have the happier your life is. They can contact old friends too, to keep in touch. Friends aren't the only thing they can contact though.

Most importantly, it allows children to contact people for important things, like their parents. With a cell phone, students can talk with their parents or guardian when something important comes up. What if a student finds out there's a basketball game after school that they want to watch? If they can't contact their parents, they can't go to the game, because their guardian would worry about them. If their parents need to contact them about something important, they can just call your cell phone. Cell phones give kids better and more continent contact.

In the end, it's better to just let kids have their cell phones. If they don't use it in class, it doesn't distract their and others education. It allows them to contact friends, and most importantly family, especially when something important happens. Why would you want to get rid of that?

Sincerely,
