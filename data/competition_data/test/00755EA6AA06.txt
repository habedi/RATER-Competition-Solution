The authors claim supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despites the danger becase their are conditions that they have to be careful with. My first reason is that not many people survive for hours. My second reason is that the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth. My third reason is that technology tends to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

" Each previos mission was un manned, and for good reasons, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." When they are flying and trying to land carefully, and they are in the ground the spaceship might end up exploting. " Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades." So they can tell why it didn't land safely to venus.

" ... such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." If you go way to deep in the ocean you would liquefy many metals." ... weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface." This can couse many different weathers.

" Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions." If you do a physical condition something can happen to you. " By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." If you have something mechanical part around you it can melt in your body and it will burn yor skin.

In conclusion, all of the conditions that they said that can happen to you can couse you to die. When you are in a spaceship try to land carefully so nothing bad happens to you.
