As a student have you ever been asked to do an extracurricular activities like sports. I think that this is a good idea because it can help student to try something new. There is a a lot more reasons that this is a good idea.

Some kids might want to serve on student council. They could make a change to there school that needs to be done. They can change how to the school operates to make it easier for the students and the teachers. The kids could make a change to the school that they think that should be made all around the world and that could influence other schools to do that do.

Doing these activities could help students to be more social with their peers. Some kids dont go outside and hangout with their peers they would rather be inside playing video games. So by doing these activities it could let them see the other side of the world that is fun and more enjoyable. They could meet new people and make new friends.

The activities could help student try something new and learn from it. Like a kid could play baseball for the first time and love it. He could make a career out of it if he wanted to. Not a lot of kids are able to try something new maybe because their parents don't have time to take them to the park. Maybe they dont live close to their friends to play baseball with.

So next time that your school ask you to join in an extracurricular activity. Think of it as a good idea and not a bad one because it could help other student that might need the time. To be social or make a change that they think is fit for the school
