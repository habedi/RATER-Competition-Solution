Here are some reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys, You get to visit many places like Greece, Europe, and China. People would also have a fun and relaxing time on the boat. Luke found time time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Cowboys got to play baseball,volleyball games, They also did Table tennis turnoments, writing, fencing,boxing,reading and whittling. It was more than an adventure for Luke too It opened up the world for him. ''It made me aware of people and other contries and their needs.''Luke said. That awarness stayed with him too. It took about two weeks to get there but it will be a very fun trip to go to snd relax,play games and do many fun things like visiting places you have never been to before like,, Anceint Greece, the tempels there and many more fantatic places that you would enjoy plus there is things to do before you get there. You have read about Seagoing Cowboys this was mainley about Luke and what he did it would be a very fun exoeriment too. He does many things before he gets to get across the Atlantic Ocean but it was worth it it would be fun for family and friends The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. What helps you though before you go you can help yourself by gelping out around a farm becuase there are many animals on board you can prepare yourself for hard work with the animals. You watch the animals clean the animals, and feed the animals too. But you do have to watch out becuase when it gets dark and you cant see when the waves pick up it will push you around and so Luke broke one of his rib cages becuase he was being pushed around so he couldn' work and help out at all.
