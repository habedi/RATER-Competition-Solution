The author supports this idea by throwing in little things like proof and trying to convince you to study Venus is a worthyu pursuit despite the dangers .He also used NASA the text says " NASA is working on other approaches to studing venus." thernhe gives us an example ssome simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the condtions. the text says. the text also states "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contibute meanninhfully to our knowledge of venus"

Thats so when can have the infomation for anybody eals that wants to know about it. and they are working on simpifed electoronics so we can acess venus alot easyer and the stuff to make it wont be hard to find. And the texts states NASA's possible soution to the hostiile conditing on the sufface of venus would allow scientists to flot above the fray. So they are thinking about sending humans to venus also but they tell us the ups and downs to that how they would the flot to the face of it and how they have to convies people to go up there. Over all The Author did very good at supporting his idea by throwing in NASA facts and telling us about the things there working to get up to venus and hoe they plan on sending humans uo there to. Any why we should keep on studying venus.
