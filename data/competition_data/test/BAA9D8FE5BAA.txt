At NASA, I finally got to see "the Face of Mars", which I think is an amazing way for kids and adults to study and get interested in the Red Planet, and I hope it's not just a way to think about aliens, lifeforms, or anything out of a Science-Fiction book. I hope in couple more weeks or months, people will stop thinking in that nonsense. The Viking 1 caught a rock formation and a shadow covering it up and making it look like it was a face. This is one of the biggest hoaxs of all time, it's in magazines, TV shows, movies, and radio talk shows, I mean some people actually tell campfire stories about this, this is crazy! I would've let it go, but then my best friend calls and says "Hey guess what, I've found out why the face is there, it's a symbol from the Martians for use to come to their planet!" I wish I could've reached through the phone so I could slap him silly. He thinks just because I work at NASA, he thinks he can be a smart scientist like me. Finally in 2001 NASA descovered that the Face was actually a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. I was finally glad we could put this behind us so that way the world can't go into chaos over a dome on Mars. Although to be fare at least some people had something to talk about or something to be interested in, because if this didn't happen, who knows what people would've done, I know my friend would've never found out a bunch of facts about Mars, or all those stories from writers, or the directors that made the stories come to big screen, it's amazing to see people actually do something with just a face on Mars.
