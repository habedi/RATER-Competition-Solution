Professor Thomas Huang has a initiative way of finding out how someone is feeling. "New computer software that can recognize emotions", some may view it as an invasion of privacy, or just straight up weird. I believe it could be a new way to not only help but to recognize your own feelings or your persona to others.

As we speak about the new invention I'd like to mention how it works. "the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face", there are 44 major muscles in the model that move like a human muscle for accuracy. Someone who is not only an expert with technology works on these but also someone who is an expert in mood, stability, etc works through these. "Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman."

"There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness......" These emotions are "calculated" per say by looks, movements, and the facial muscles. This could help dictate the feelings of someone who is unable to speak or vocalize. Now "putting on a happy face" is actually possible.
