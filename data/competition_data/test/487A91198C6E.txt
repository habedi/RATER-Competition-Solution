I agree with the principal. It is important that students work hard in school. They aren't in school to play sports, they are here to learn. Playing sports is a privilege we get in middle school and high school. In my opinion, we need education before sports, this is not a right we have to play sports, but a privilege, and the point of school it to learn, not athletic activities.

Many students may disagree with the principal with having to maintain a B average to participate in sports. I am not one of those students. Students who have worked hard to get their grades up and have the B average or higher deserve the spot in the sport, if they are good enough. Kids who slack off during class don't deserve the chance to take part in a sport. It isn't fair to the kids who have work so hard for all of their lives.

I have friends who think that no matter what, even if their grade drop, they will make the team or stay on the team. No coach needs that student that badly. It is not something you just get to do. You need good grades. It is a privilege to play sports. If the students really want to participate in them, they need to work harder!

School is a place of learning, not sports. Yes, sports are a part of school, but it's not the main focus. The student education is what is most important. We need to keep it that way. If the principal gives in to the students who think it's okay to have under a B average and play sports, then the rest of the county will think that we don't care about education. They will think all we care about is being good at sports. That is not the reputation we want for this school.

The principal needs to stick with his rule. Playing sports needs to be earned. It will teach students to go for what they want, and really work. Kids should know that not everything is his or her right, some things you must earn. Education comes first, other things come second. A great thing about needing good grades is, if you really want to play that sport, good grades look amazing on college applications.
