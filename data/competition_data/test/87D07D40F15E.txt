Dear Principal,

Many students have a C average and this concerns the sports and activities they are allowed to do in school.

I think that you should still allow students with a C average to play sports and activities for a couple of reasons.

First, sports and clubs are important things in a persons life.

Second, a C average is still a normal grade average.

To begin with, sports and activities are important in a persons life.

In clubs, activities and sports you learn important skills that can later be useful in one's life.

You learn teamwork and how to work well with others.

Also, you make friends were you are not just grouped together academically but also with your interests.

Second, to have a C average is still a normal grade average.

You shouldn't have to be best in class to play sports or be in clubs.

Sports and clubs are an entirely different category were you are not judged by how smart you are but by your ability to get along with other people and do things that you enjoy.

All and all, taking away sports and activities will take away a very important experience in someone life.

You should not just be judged on how smart you are but also teamwork and friendship.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
