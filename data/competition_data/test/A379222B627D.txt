The Seagoing Cowboy Program is a great cause. You get to hang out with animals, and help people. There are extra perks, such as seeing the world. We are a great cause because we help people that were hit hard by World War II.So the Seagoing Cowboys Program is a great idea!

In the Seagoing Cowboys Program, you get to take care of animals. Animals such as horses, cows, and mules.

There is some hard work but it is really worth it to help so many people. And the animals are truly fun! Animals are a great part of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I was a Seagoing

Cowboy. I loved it. Once I almost fell off the ship, though, so it is dangerous. But Being a Seagoing Cowboy is really fun! I helped many people, all across the world. I loved being a Seagoing Cowboy!

You can see the world in the Seagoing Cowboys program! Once I saw the Acropolis in Greece! But there are so many other places to help people in. And I saw a lot of them. I saw many things being a Seagoing Cowboy!
