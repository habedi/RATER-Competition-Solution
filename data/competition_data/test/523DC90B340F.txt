Dear, principle

The new policy, to me is not a very good Idea. One many students work at an average level. This would cause these student who do not work at the level as others, not be able to play sports or attend other after-school activities. This in my case is not fair to those students on many levels.

For starters, if most students have a C, many of them will not be able to play. Some are capable if pulling their grades up. But on the other hand others may be doing their best to keep a C. It would be more legitimate for the policy is, If you are passing your classes you should be able to be in after-school activities.

Also, for the people who are already at a B average, they might think they do not have to try as hard as the others and their grades may slacken due to this. Then they will also be restricted from these activities as well. Therefore disabling many more students to be illegible to play, this also causes stress. Which is not very good for young students as us, then could also cause us to even worse than we already are.

After all, students try harder to keep their grades up when they are doing these activities, without them students tend to slack off cause their will be no punishments for not doing them. These activities teach responsibility for students to work hard and continue to do it with striving success

To conclude, This is what most students need to relive stress. Without these activities it stops kids from developing skills that might have been needed. Also teaches a great deal of responsibility for a student to learn, which is needed for I future life. We can really benefit from these and extending the standards are not helping that much.

sincerely,
