In ¨Challenge of Exploring Venus,¨ the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author makess it very obvious that he has a bias opinion on whether or not we should explore Venus despite the dangers it presents. We see in Paragraph 8 a statement made by the author that exhibits his feelings on the matter. ¨Striving to invent the challenge presented by Venus has value. only beacause of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travel on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation¨, this shows the author thinks that we should not let the dangers and set backs prevent us from exploring our universe and discorvering more about Venus.

Another example of the authors opinion is the statement made in paragraph 6, ¨Therefore scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.¨ The author makes it obvious that he thinks we should not focus on the risks and dangers but to go explore the planet. This article shows us that the priviledge of studying and observing a planet far exceeds the dangers of what might happen if we do.
