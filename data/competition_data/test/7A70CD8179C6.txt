Twenty five years ago something happened on Mars. In 1976 we discovered that there was a unusual face on the planet of Mars. The landform was located 41 degrees north martian latitude.

The face on Mars is a landform because there was no alien monument. And also scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact. I know this because in the article it states, "The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This shows that there is no alien activity on Mars and that there's just shadows that forms the human shaped head.

Twenty five years ago NASA found a human shaped head on the planet of Mars. People believed that alien activity caused the head but what really was was shadows that formed the head. Then in 1998, and 2001 NASA and scientists upgraded to a new high resolution image to figure out it wasn't formed by aliens.
