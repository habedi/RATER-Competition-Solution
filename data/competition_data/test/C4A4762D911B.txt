Should school required summer projects be designed by the teacher or the student? I say it should be designed by the student. If the student designs the project, it allows the student to show the teacher what they have learned. This could also help teach students good life skills for later in their lives. Having a teacher design the project, takes away the chance for a student to learn how to be independent. So, students should be in charge of designing their summer projects, because of life lessons they could learn.

If the student does the designing for the project, they can show the teacher what they have learned in their classes. This will also allow the teacher to see what they need to work on more with their students. This being said, it also allows the student to understand what they need to focus on more when learning. If the teacher designs it, the student wouldn't be able to learn as much on what they know or don't know. Thus, it opens up ideas for students to do the project on, and understand why they couldn't do something because they weren't fully understanding one idea, or many.

A great life lesson this summer project can teach the students is how to be independent, reliable, and responsible. It's a great way for the student to be ready for when they graduate school and need to learn how to plan for the future for themselves. If the teacher designs this project, they would be taking away the opportunity for the student to learn a great life skills. This being, students have a better chance of learning more from designing the project, then having their teacher designs it for them.

Having a teacher design the project would not be as beneficial for the student as it would be if the students designed it. This is a chance for the students to learn how to work on time management. Being able to work on time management for the project allows the student to work on planing for when they should be at a milestone of the project. This allows the students to be more self-efficient for working. This helps them learn how to work on the project better and be able to complete the project knowing that they designed it, and worked on it without having someone tell them what to do. This will help build self-confidence in the students and have them be able to complete a task more efficient when they do it.

Having students design their summer projects for school is a good idea. It has them showing their teacher what they have learned. Also have them learning life skills/lessons from this project. The students can also learn time management, and learn how to be more self-confident and more self-efficient. All of these lessons or skills help a student learn, and demonstrate to their teacher what good of a worker they are, when the student designs the project.
