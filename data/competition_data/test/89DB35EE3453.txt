In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

She also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, she uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

She explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a "blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, she was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that "...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions."

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing her readers that her original claim is supported.

The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" was able to support her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

She was able to think of challenges that space explorers may face.

Then, she was able to counteract those problems with solutions.

She effectively made her case and supported it with details.
