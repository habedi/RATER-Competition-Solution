The driverless cars could still be dangerous. Maybe it stops working, or maybe something goes wrong. You can never trust a car because eventually everything stops working at some point in time. But how you know if this car is stable and good for you to drive. I guess we will find out.

Yes, it tells you have you make it and that they will test drive it for you but how exactly do you know that its safe to driver. A car driving all by itself coud go wrong i mean you still have to help stere it when there's like construction or a car accident up ahead. But if the car is sepposed to drive by itself if should be able to do that to because the car drives by itself. Driverless cars are scary if you think about it because something could go wrong when you're driving it. It could stop stereing by itsef and what are you going to do nothing because you can't if a car stops it's stereing. What would you do if the wheels stops sensoring the brakes and you need to stop everything could go out and you would be able to fix it. If you stay with the cars we have now you could take it into the shop have them look at it and tell what's wrong with it, and they can help you fix it. We have enough laws as it is, added more for a car that needs a law for liability in an accident just for the car, no thank you. If you get in an accident is it your fault or the manufacturer? The manufacturer because why is it your fault when the car can stere itself answer that one for me.

So why would you want a car that is not for you? You dont. Do you want to get in to an accident and them ask you if it's the cars fault or yours, cleary its the cars, because " it can driver by itself."If the car can drive by itself then why do you need to take control for construct or a accident up ahead we shouldn't have to do that, that should already be programed into the car. So i will gladly not take one in 2020.
