Dear Principal,

Policy #1 Please!

I can't believe the principal is actually considering letting students use their phones; IN SCHOOL!! It's like a dream come true!

I think the principal should totally choose this policy number one. You want to know why?? Well here i go.

I think you should let us use our cell phones in school because I don't Know what the big deal is! As long as we can use them during our free time , I don't think it would be an issue. I can understand with you not wanting us to use them in the class rooms because that is the learning hour. So I think it would be okay and should be considered to let us use our cell phones at appropriate times of the school day.

I think if the teachers are still worried about cell phone use in class, they should make students take out their phones and put them on their desk top and take out the battery. This could really help out. And sure, I would love the thought of being able to use our cell phones at least once a day. At breaks and lunch would be awsome.

And it could be that if students get their daily talk out of the way, their lively to focus and do better in the class rooms.

So i don't think that you shouldn't be able to use your phone at all, just not

ALL

day! So i really think you should consider promoting this idea.

It would help the students out and the teachers out so that they won't be so worried and so the kids won't have to get in trouble and get sent to the office because of their cell phones go off in class or their caught texting. I don't think things like this would happen if you carry on and consider POLICY #1!!!!!!!!

Sinceriously,
