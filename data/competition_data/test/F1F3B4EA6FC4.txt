Starting at a young age and throughout their life, every child and person wants to be great at something. If you look at the people who are truly great at what they do, they all started their passion at a young age. Many sports players, politicians, and people in all fields are a great example of this. Quite frankly, extracurricular activities are a great way to spur interest within students in their youth. For this reason, I believe that the principal made the right decision about making students do at least one extracurricular activity. Beside for getting students to develop an interest and passion for something at a young age, extracirrular activities also help people become more confident in their abilities. Additionally, with all of these options, there has to be at least one activity for each student to have an interest in.

As I stated earlier, extracurricular activities are a great way to get students to find a new interest. For all you know, the student may really like the activity and pursue it as a profession. Without being required to do the activity, the student may not have even discovered their interest in whatever the activity is. Requiring students to do extracurricular is a great way to open new door and possibilities for the student. There are many different activities the student can take, so at least one has to be appealing. By finding out what they have an interest in, and starting at a young age, the student will have plenty of time to develop the skills need at get really good at something. It is important to be unique in at least one thing, because it helps identify who you are as a person. Even if the student does not "fall in love" with their activity, it still could not hurt to try something new.

Staying on the topic of learning something new, extracirrular activities are a great way to get students out of their comfort zone and to build up self-confidence. If the school did not require the student to take an extracurricular activity, chances are that the student would not have tried out something new. By making students try something new or continue something that they are already good at, it is making them better at whatever they are doing. This boosts their confidence level, and makes them want to try even more new things. Additionally, many of these clubs and activities include working with other people and students. This means that these clubs help students with their communication, organization, and teamwork skills. Personally, I am on my school's debate team, and I enjoy not only having fun and tournaments, but also working with my friends that are also on the team. Even though I do not really plan on becoming a lawyer or politician, I still feel as if being on the team has made me a more confident and clear speaker. Helping develop important life skills is once again another benefit of making requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity.

Whether it is a sport, club, or leadership position, there is always something for each and every student. Based on the field that the person wants to go in, they can do an activity that is related to that field. For example, if the person wanted to be a politician, they could do something relating to the student council. Out of the many choices for extracurricular activities, at least one has to fit each student. Even if the student is not sure what they want to be, there are also plenty of options such as sports that are plenty of fun!

Although some people may say that it is not right to force somebody into doing an activity, or say that there are better things the person can do with that time, the whole purpose of requiring students to do after school activities is so they can get better. Not only do extracurricular actitivites help give students important life skills, but they also give students a chance to gain an interest and passion in an activity. If anything, it just giving the students another opportunity to try out something new. It is almost guaranteed that every student will find something that they can manage, so there is no downsides of requiring students to do extracurricular activities.

As I mentioned earlier, it is best for people start something at a young age, and requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a great way to do that.
