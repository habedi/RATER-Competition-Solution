When you need the education, but is not able to accessed from where your are, you have to resort to the next best thing, online schools. The statement made asking if it's beneficial to do online school learning at home or not, my opinion is that it is beneficial for the students to take online classes at their homes. Reasons being that for the students that may have some problems with convenience, online schooling would near completely erase that. There is the convenience of being able to learn online from almost anywhere, students being able to do the learning at their own time, and for students to have a higher chance of wanting to learn since they have the choice of when they want to learn and where they would work best in.

The first evidence is that there is the convenience of being able to learn from almost every location around the world where there is wifi or some form of data connectivity. If the student is in a location where he or she is not able to get to the school physically let it because of environmental reasons or health reasons, the use of the internet can allow them the close the gap between them and the teachers thorough a simple video face cam process. With the added benefit of being able to do it anywhere it can also attribute to their comfort, since if they are in a area where they are most comfortable learning in such as their homes, which by its self can help them learn better in a place where the student, attending the online class, is most familiar with. There is also the convenience of time, since if time is not on the students side and they miss a online class day they can simply get a recording of the session allowing he or she to catch up on the topic. There is also the near face to face conversations with the teacher through video/ face cam, since if it was a private lesson the student and the teacher can get a one on one in two different locations of the world. There are also many free online schools willing to teach for free, so if the student is not able to afford it there are still free online classes for them to take that may very well be not so different from the other online classes where you have to pay.

The second evidence of the benefits of online learning is that the student can learn at their own pace. School these days, in the modern twenty first century, can make you get up early and make you sleep very late cause of the given work loads and the amount of topics needed to be studied, leading to sleep deprivation, and it can really impact the performance you have at school which can risk your grades. Thats why the benefits of being able to do the learning at the students convenience is so important. Since the student can wake up at their earliest convenience to get rid of any added fatigued or tiredness so that the student can have the maximum efficiency to learn the topic at hand. This leads the students to have the added benefit of working better just because of getting more sleep. With the increase amount of sleep this gives the added benefit of the student willing to learn, since they are energized and ready to learn they don't have to feel that they are being forced to learn at their worst conditions, especially in a classroom setting where they may also be unnecessary tension or pressure towards the student to meet their teachers expectation there and now.

The third evidence is from my own experience, I myself have never done any online classes but I know many friends and family members who do take the online classes and most if not all have given me positive reviews of the online classes they have taken. My cousin in South Korea right now for about three to four year have been taking an online class to learn a different language. The language that my cousin wanted to learn was not a language that was being taught at her current school. So she took to the internet and had found a amazing teacher form Europe willing to teach from minimal pricing for a contract of 3 year teaching, which lead to my cousin having a good deal. Through the online lessons my cousin was able to learn her preferred language and at a low cost, which saved her financially since my cousin was a bit tight on money, and allowed her to learn at home the environment of where she feels the most comfortable at, since is South Korea comfort is a necessity in a academically competitive country. It is not just my cousin numerous friends of mine, who took online classes, have told me that taking a online class at their homes increases the sleep and convenience while decreasing the work load for them at the same time, also allowing them to go over the given notes or materials constantly instead of having to continue on without knowing the material, which makes them want to do the class more, also the online classes have allowed my friends to come to a near face to face experience with the teacher of the online class they were taking.

With that being said, through the many added benefits of taking online classes at home. It allows the student to have the convenience of being able to take the class anywhere with wifi or data connectivity and getting the maximum amount of comfort in their own homes, allowing the students taking the online class to do the work at their own time to ensure that the student is ready to learn at their best shape possible during the day, and the evidence of my family member and friends enjoying the convenience of the online class/classes they are taking at home making them want to do the online class even more. So are online classes taken at home beneficial or not, with the evidence and reasoning given I think it is safe to say that it is beneficial.
