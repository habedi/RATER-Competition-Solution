The world we inhabit is unpredictable and chaotic in nature as nothing is truly considered absolute. To further elaborate, our education system does not incorporate nor place these various components of unpredictability into consideration in regards to education. One such possible method to incorporate the inconsistent characteristics of life into a student's education would be by the offering of distance learning, as a viable alternative to a traditional education. This feat would be achieved via utilization of online chat rooms working in synchronization with video conferences. Some may argue or disagree with this notion, but to do so would be arrogant. A significant portion of students would benefit by attending classes from home because it is efficient and offers a plethora of opportunities and alternatives.

Utilizing distance learning education could be considered much more efficient as this particular method promotes the elimination of wasting time. For instance, the society that we reside within is obsessed with the various concepts of time. Every task must be achieved within a certain restriction of time, or it is to be considered flawed. This mentality itself of "punctuality" is flawed as time itself is relative. But by eliminating the requirement of various tasks that needlessly waste time, such as transportation or preparation, a student is capable of achieving much greater feats.

Distance learning could potentially provide a plethora of students with a secure alternative location for their education. For example, the recent number of increasing confirmed reports of the corona virus within the United States has caused a widespread panic amongst the public. This specific and unpredictable strain of virus spreads rapidly through physical contact. But by eliminating the need to travel to a designated location and mingling with large crowds, the pandemic would barely impact the education of an individual. Furthermore, other threats such as mass shootings within schools would dwindle significantly in numbers due to the lack of students physically present.

Some may argue that students would not benefit from participating in classes from home because this method is drastically different from what is to be considered a proper education, but this is not the case. There are still various assignments and assessments to be completed in an efficient manner. Distance learning is just simply another method of surmounting the endeavor of obtaining an education but from the comforts of one's home. As this specific method promotes efficiency in addition to providing ample opportunities and alternatives for individuals striving for success.

Distance learning is a definitively viable alternative to a traditional education that incorporates and accommodates for the unpredictable and chaotic characteristics of life.
