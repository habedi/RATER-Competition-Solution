If I was to receive work for the summer break I would rather it be student designed work and not teacher designed work for many reasons. Theres the fact that if my work was designed by a student someone with a similar mindset as my own I would be able to understand it more clearly than if it was designed by a teacher. Plus theres the fact that student designed work has a possibility of being more simplistic, although teacher designed work is good for challenging the mind and stimulating brain cells im sure students would much rather enjoy there break much sooner. For example if your teacher gave you the choice to have the person to your left choose your summer project for you or have a five page essay on a prompt she gave you which one would you rather do not that hard of a choice is it.

One of the main reasons why I prefer work made by students over work made by teachers is because its easier to comprehend for those who have a harder time understanding more than others. With students making the work It would challenging without being to difficult to the point were it would consume a large amount of time to complete and not anytime to do anything during summer break. Unlike if you got an Teacher assigned project which could have the possibility to consume a large amount of time to complete. Like for example: if hypotheticaly speaking if the person to your left only give an assignment to write one to two paragraphs about a entire country and there culture or get an a your teacher gives you to write a four to five page essay about the history of schoool and how it started.

If I were to have a choice between simple work and complex work I would choose simple almost everytime because of one main reason is it takes less time to do. With the student designed work you would finish faster allowing you to have more free time to enjoy your summer break and relax away from school. Theres also the added benefit of getting more simple work done in a short time frame than you would complex work. I conclude this by saying that it would be more logical to have students design there own work for the summer break rather than have a teacher assign them some work for the summer break.
