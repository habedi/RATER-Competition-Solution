Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that all students should be required to perform community service over the time that they are at SCHOOL_NAME. I have friends who love to participate in community service. I also have friends who think it takes up to much time away from what they want and need to do in their daily lives. I think that maybe if we have a requirement for at least one act of community service people will see how much fun it could be. Lots of kids today do nothing for their community. All they do is sit around and do nothing and having nothing to do leaves them at the vulnerability to commit wrongful acts against their community out of boredom. Kids are helping to mess up their community rather than helping to build it up so it can be a better place for the next generation of kids who will live there. You giving them the chance to do something for their community even if they don't want to will keep most of their minds of their minds off the bad things and on good things that others will appreciate. I myself have times when i am bored with nothing to do and i think "Hey wouldn't it be fun to just reck something", but i stop myself halfway in between that thought and call up one of my friends who help service their community and mine and ask if i can join with them to help out. I want my other friends who need more time to do the things they want and need to do to have more important and better thing to focus on in their lives. I would greatly appreciate it if you required our school to perform community service.

P.S. It Might change the future of kids my age and younger!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
