Dear Principal,

I am writing you this letter to in form you that all cell phones at school must be abolished. letting students be able to use cell phones is a bad idea.

If students are able to use their cell phones at school it will make room for distractions and detentions. In schools, 80% of students have cell phones. This many students using cell phones would permit a bad influence. For example, students suing cell phones at luch will be louder than usual, most likely up and about trying to get peoples numbers, and very likely to throw or try to damage other peoples phones. Also, kids who like to cause trouble, will most likely try to use their cell phone or not turn it off rite away at times when you are not aloud to use it. Having kids able to use cell phones will only add to distractions and safety hazards.

Some might argue that letting students use their cell phones in school is a good idea because they would get to talk to their friends and be in better moods. However, students have plenty of social time already. They have their lunch periods, between classes, after school, and many teachers do give students some time to socialize with friends for at least a couple minutes. More time for students to socialize would be too much and they would not focus enough on their work. Therefore, letting students use their cell phones in school hours is unacceptable.

In conclusion, cell phones in school hours would not be a good addition to school systems. Students using their phones would be a distraction to the learning environment. It would also influence bad behavior on students. Lastly, it would give students more social time, which would take away the students attention from their work. As you can see, cell phone use in school hours must be abolished.

sincerely,
