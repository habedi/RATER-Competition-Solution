The Challenging of Exploring Venus

The venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to sun. But, long time ago, Venus was propably covered with oceans and it was also possible to survive. The life can be as simple as we are living in Earth. However, Venus still have some things which a living beings needs to survive. This planet has a rocky sediment anf includes such a familiar features like valleys, mountains, and craters.

Venus can also conclude as our second option, if we have to choose another place except Earth. But Venus's reputation is a challenging planet for humans to study. Not even a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Sometimes we are closer to the Mars and sometimes we are closer to Venus. This all is because of difference in speed. As Venus is sometimes right around the corner, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land.

NASA has an idea to send humans to study about Venus. To explain the idea of NASA author has used few examples like blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. Author also uses jet airplanes as an example as our jet airplanes traveln at a higher altitude to fly over many storms. NASA explains about the temperature and solar power on Venus for survivle of humans. The temperature is around 170 degrees in Fahrenheit, but the air pressure is going to be close to the sea level of Earth. Solar power will be enough and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Conditions is not really easy but enough for the survival of humans.

It's important or it's wothy to study about Venus as this is the only planet on space except Earth where humans can survive. And it's research done by NASA explains that humans can also survive in Venus but it's not going to be as easy as we are living in Earth. Venus is often referred as Earth's twin.
