I think that students should be required to have a B average.

Getting a C average means your really not trying 100%.

Everyone is capable of having even an A average.

If you pay attention in school, and are following directions, studying, working hard, then everyone should be getting all A' s.

I understand a few B' s and C' s here and there, but A' s are really not that hard to achieve.

Grades and school are huge deals.

If you want to go to college, most colleges require a B average, or 3.0 GPA.

Also, college is really expensive.

Colleges sometimes give out scholarships, but you really have to be a hard worker and get really good grades.

Sports can be key for scholarships, too.

There are both academic and sport scholarships.

I always say school before sports, cause school is really important.

If you want to get a good job, college can be insanely important.

If you screw up once, it could change your life.

It's important to be nice to your teachers, too.

Some job applications require recommendations.

You know what they say, "The only place success comes before working hard is in the dictionary."

So mainly, I think students should be achieving a B average no problem.

Also, it's important to stay away from drugs and alcohol.

They can really screw up your life.

I knew someone who was most likely going to go to a D-1 college for basketball, but got involved with drugs and drinking at parties, and it messed up their whole basketball career.

They could have been making millions of dollars in the NBA, but made some bad decisions and messed it all up big time.

Drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives.

Most students wouldn't like that grade change, but in the long run it's really helping them change their lives.

Some pro basketball players went from high school straight to the pros.

They really don't know much about anything now either.
