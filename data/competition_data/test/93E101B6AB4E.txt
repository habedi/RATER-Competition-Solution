Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by using online or video conferencing. I think some students would benefit from this and other students would not.

I believe some students could benefit from this because they could do work whenever they want, They also don't have to wake up early everyday and go to school. If they have things to do at home, they can do that and still have time for school work. I also believe that some students would not benefit off this.

I dont think all students would do good with this because not everyone learns the same way. For example, some students learn visually. Not all students have a peaceful household, which makes it harder to pay attention to their work. Students can also have learning disabilities which can make it difficult to learn.

In my opinion, it really just depends on who the student is. Maybe distance learning is not for everyone.
