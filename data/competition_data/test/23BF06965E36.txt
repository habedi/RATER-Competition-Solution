Dear state senator, I believe that you should keep the Electoral College rather than the most popular vote for the president. "The founding fathers established it". Basically this method has been going on since George Washington. How it works is you choose either your Republican or Democratic president, and depending on who has more votes for the president. The electoral votes go to the republican or to the democratic.

Citizens of the United States also voted upon this selection. In the passage " The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong", it talks about how the candidates don't make it to every state. How could they? They are trying to promote and sign papers. They have a life too you know. They can't be in every single state in America. You could also see them on the Televeision if you want.

The Electoral College doesnt have the problem of elections in which "no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast" Evene if more people voted for the democratic or Republican president they still aren't gonna get what they want. Some people in 2008 wanted that other president, not Obama, to win. In school they were saying how he was racist and that they shouldn't vote for him. He wanted to put all the Mexicans back in Mexico.

Also would you rather count up a million people up or simple the number of senators for each person running which added together would be 538 electors.
