To whomever it may concern,

Students at out school have been informed you would like to change the school policy of participation of playing sports while maintaining a B average.

I agree completely with your consideration of the new rule.

It would be a very smart idea, helping students keeping their grade up as an incentive for them to play the sport of their choice.

Requiring students maintaining a B grade average to play sports is a great idea.

It is an incentive for the athletes to play the sport they love, while representing our school at the same time.

It teaches kids that in order to do something they love, there might be something they need to do to earn there way into the sports they would like to play.

It also is a good idea because they will be getting good grades.

Getting a job later in life is a good incentive for student too.

While getting an education, you get good records and good grades.

It all can be used for your future.

Because you can get a better job and a good college scholarship for sports, just because you were aloud to play that one year of middle school or high school.

One reason it may be not so good is because basketball, or baseball, or track, or any sport is really good exercise for people. If you limit the kids being able to play, it limits your team, and it lessens the fitness for those kids.

I hope you consider my letter as being a good choice for your school.

It definitely helps grades, and futures for kids.

Sincerely,

Student at your school
