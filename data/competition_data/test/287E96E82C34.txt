The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is a waste of time. I think it's a waste of time because studies show that you can be able to tell when someone is down. Not by the face but by their actions. You will start to see a change in them, they wont act the same even if they try so hard to,ect. The Facial Action Coding System is a waste of money, time, and space.

Why do all this just to see if someone is hiding their emotions, when you can just observe them. A true friend, mother, father ect; will know if something is wrong with their loved ones. In the article the very first sentence says " she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." Why does it matter how fearful,disgusted,or angry she is if it clearly states she happy 83 percent. We are not computers, robots or none of that we are human beings and we all have different emotions running at the same time. Thats what makes us, us!

In the article it also states " For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect." My point here is that you dont observe a persons feelings by looking at their face. You observe the way they act and compare it to how they usually act when mad, sad, or happy, ect. People sometimes hide their emotions by putting on a fake smile, hiding their true emotions thats why you observe actions.

I just feel as if its easy to tell the difference between different emotions. It's common sense to me, but it may not be to you. When you really think about it, they make it seem like its really complicated. But if you would just pay close attention to your loved ones, and stop thinking that everyone has to always be happy. Then you will see that its easy to tell the difference of each emotion we humans have.

This is why i think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Hopefully you will understand where i'm coming from. The Facial Action Coding System is unnessacary, and a waste of time. It's easy to tell when someone is acting strange or different. All you have to do is observe.
