You say that the Face on Mars was created by an alien civilization. However, this is somply not true. The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to a mesa here on Earth. You may think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, but there is substantial evidence to prove otherwise, that the "Face" is nothing more than a natural landform.

There is plenty of evidence to support the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation. If the Face were created by an alien civilization, NASA would greatly benefit. Therefore, there would be no reason to hide the information. "defenders of the NASA budjet wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars" (5). The second photo of the Face on Mars was claimed by some to be inconclusive because of the haze created by the winter weather on Mars. However, a third photo of the Face was taken on April 8, 2001 "a cloudless summer day in Cydonia [the region of Mars where the Face resides]" (10) tat also clearly shows that the Face on Mars is not a face at all, but simply a natural land formation.

The Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural land formation. "'[the Face on Mars] reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,'" (12). If the ruins of an alien civilization actually existed on Mars, NASA would reap a great benifit, meaning that there would be no reason to hide the discovery. The first picture showing the Face on Mars as merely a natural landform was dismissed by skeptics because the time of year the photo was taken gave the camera a layer of haze to look through to see the face. This haze, skeptics said, hid the alien markings from view. However, this was disproven in April 2001, when a new photo was taken during the clear summertime on Mars. This photo still showed that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to the mesas of Earth.
