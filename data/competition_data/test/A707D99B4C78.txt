Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am one of your 8th grade students. I think that this policy is an amazing idea but it does have some problems. At first its good because many of our athletes that don't have good grades love the sport they play and there parents would be furious if they didn't play it. This would almost force them into becoming good students. I also think its a bad idea because what if the athlete is a very good one and he or she will decide to just quit instead of trying to put forth a good effort or he or she will not be able to pass. This would make many parents furious that there kid can't play on the team. Some parents push there kid really hard and think there child's future should rely on their athletic abilities. These parents would go to drastic measures like just pulling there kids out of school, which would make are district look bad. Another drastic thing these pushy parents might is sue the school. The schools probably would win but what if they didn't and even if the schools would win the trial they still have to pay for a lawyer. Do we really want to waste government funding on something like that or do we want to spend it on school supplies like new books and computers? I still think this would be a great idea but we should have to try and help the athletes who get more poor grades and maybe even kids who don't play sports but still get poor grades.

I do have some ideas for helping out kids. I have one idea that I like to call grade detention. It's if a kid's grades aren't at a certain percentage they would loose some privileges. They would have to attend a work friendly environment with other kids. The school would decide when and where it would meet and kids should be allowed to attend it if they just want help with grades. In the club they would take notes from a text book, work on homework, and work on extra credit assignments if they are available. The students who would have to attend this would have to attend these classes for at least half a quarter. They would each be given a piece of paper for each quarter. On this paper there will be a fill in the blank checklist and an area where they will record and keep track of there grades. A binder and hole punch will be greatly encouraged to have. They will be taught in the beginning on how to stay organized and file each paper or set of notes they take in there binder and how to record the grades the get back from the teacher. Another thing that will be encouraged in this would be learning how to have fun in school, because lets face it, school is really boring sometimes. If it's more fun kids will put forth more effort and try a little harder. One more thing they should have is a variety of colored pens. They would use this to take notes and they would be encouraged to write certain things in different colors. The multiple colors used would keep the kid awake more when they take notes and maybe some would start to like taking notes. Also the colorful notes would be more fun to read and if they use a certain color ink for important information it would be easier to study later on. These methods I have used myself and they have helped my grades improve dramatically. Please consider what I have told you and please pass this on to the super intendment and other "higher ups".

sincerely,
