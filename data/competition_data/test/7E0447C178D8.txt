Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand that Policy 1 is already the school's cell phone policy, but Policy 2 is what I believe to be the better of the choices. Instead of allowing us to bring and use them during free times, phones should not be permitted at school.

Being a student here myself, I have witnessed the lack of recognition the policy has been given. Mostly every student with a cell phone switches them to silent or vibrate while they are in class, and some do not even bother to conceal the constant rings emitted. Every few days there is one phone in one class that goes off, and the lesson is suddenly interrupted until the suspect is found and has faced the consequences.

Not only are the phones still on during learning times, but some are even put to use. Countless times have I seen someone pull out their cell phone and once concealed from the adult's view, send messages that will probably end up ringing a phone in another room. Behind jackets, below books, hidden in pockets and, sometimes, just out in the open when the ruler of the class has turned their back -the phone is brought out.

Even though its understandable to keep them, just in case of emergency or need to assure parents that the child is well, it's better to leave that for phones on campus, preferably ones that are not cellular. If a student ever needs to contact a parent to pick them up, remind them of their late return home, or make any important call of the sort, they should report to the office, ask for permission, and call from there.

Not allowing cell phones may provoke students to bring and hide them, but spotting them should be easy if others follow the rule. Policy 2 would be the ideal way of keeping sixth, seventh, and eighth-graders in line, and away from one of the main distractions that prevent them from doing their uttermost best.

Your student,
