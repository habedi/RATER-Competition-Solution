Dear TEACHER_NAME

I hear that you are struggling with the decision of whether or not to require all students do community service. Many people think that this is a great idea, but then again, some might revolt. I think that giving students community service is a wonderful idea.

If students perform community service, it give them less time to get into trouble. For example, when kids are restless, or don't get enough respect, they go looking for it! Most of the time, they get attention by getting themselves into trouble. If they had something occupying their time, they would spend less time trying to make disorder. Also, it could give them a reason to have attention without ruining their childhood lives. If students are always in trouble, research shows that it's mostly because they have a troubled home life, and they feel like no one cares about them. If you could show them that you care enough to want their help, they would feel wanted in our society.

If every student in our school performed community service, that would show a great example for other neighborhoods. We could show that Carbonado, though small, is a helpful, caring, and loving society! We could show big cities, such as Seattle or Tacoma, that even though we're small, we can help the future. This could really help the world, and even if it doesn't, it would help our little community. If we take charge, and each person does his or her part, then we could encourage other towns or cities to do the same!

Doing community service in our town could help bring us together, while helping everyone at the same time. People in Carbonado vary, and this could help us become closer, more like one big family. If some people could clean litter off the streets, and others could help tutor kids in younger grades, this would help the future of the world. All students need is a little encouragement, and the satisfaction of knowing that they are really going to help. Also that they are not going to be ridiculed by other students for doing this! We need a helping hand, and that helping hand is yours. We need your help, are you just going to sit around while Carbonado becomes a ghost town? The future of this community is in your hands, what are you going to do about it?

Thank you,
