It is just a landform, I mean we find so many of these things and usually we think nothing about them? What makes this one so special? The fact that it's shaped like a face? That's really the only thing that makes it so special is its shape. We have proof, we have photos, good photos, extrordinary photos of this, and they prove that it is just a landform. We even have these things on Earth. The only thing that makes this so special is its shape. If it weren't shaped like that, people wouldn't even give it a second thought.

Also don't you think that if it were created by aliens we'd have more proof? All we have is a weird shaped landform? That's all we have and we see them all the time. Erosion that's what made your face on Mars.

That is why its nothing but a landform, We've found plenty of them and nothing as ever been special about them. We have proof that ti is just landform. We have not proof of alien life.
