You are sitting in the gym during the boring assembly. You and your friends just want to get out and go to history, but then the principal says something that catches your attention, He says " For now on, all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity." Everyone in the gym did not say a word because some of the kids did not want to do an extracurricular activity. You like this idea because it will allow students to have something to do after school, it will get rid of some stress for student, and it will make the student more responsible.

It will allow students to have something to do after school whether that be sports, band, yearbook, or even student council. If they do not do any extracurricular activity, what are they going to do. Either play video games or do stuff with their friends that they should not be doing. If every student does an extracurricular activity then they will have something other to do that sit on their couch watching TV and playing video games.

Doing an extracurricular activity will get rid of some stress for some students. Whether they are stressed about homework, family, or friends, doing an extracurricular activity will make the stress go away for some students. If you do an extracurricular activity it will make it easier for the student because it allows them to let it all out. You could even practice when you are stressed even if it is just getting up and practicing yourÂ extracurricular activity.

Making you responsible inside and outside of school. Now at my school if you do not have good grades you can not play the next game. So if students were to participate in an extracurricular activity it would make them want to do their homework so that they can play in their next game or so. It will even make you responsible in your own home by making you want to do your chores so that your parents won't make you sit out your next game. So by being in an extracurricular activity it will make student more responsible.

So yes I do agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will allow then to have something to do after school, getting rid of stress for some of the students, and being responsible inside and outside of school. I wish that all school would do this for those reasons. It is a good idea because it will make students be a better person.
