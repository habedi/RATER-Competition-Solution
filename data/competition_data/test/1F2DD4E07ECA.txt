For some students who are good at sports they find it difficult to keep a B average and still play that sport. Some students who are doing those sports may be in advanced classes and its harder for them to keep a B average. We use the C average be cause a C is average and anything higher is above average. Possibly some of the students who are in sports don't have a lot of time out of school to do their homework when they get out of school because of sports and that's what's causing them to have a C average.

It's for hard for some students to keep above a C average because of maybe problems at home with family, and that's keeping them from staying focused at school and they do sports or other activities to keep their mind off of the problems at home. Possibly they have been injured and was in the hospital for a week and came back and had a lot of makeup work to do and they could get it done in time and their grade was affected by this and that person wanted to be in a drama club after school.

I am against having a grade B average because i can't always keep a grade B average in all my classes. I wanted to try out for the basketball team this year but i couldn't because i had a D+ in social studies and right after try outs were over my grade was raised to a C.

Some of the best players on their team can only keep a C average and the school wouldn't want to cost that team the game because they changed it to a B average.

They could make it to where some of the after school activities require a B average, and some don't have to have a B average.
