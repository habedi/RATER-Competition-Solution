A project during the summer, is a students worst nightmare. Certain schools do this to insure that their students are still learning during the vacation. If students designed this projects over the summer,not only will they have fun while learning, have all the creativity in the world, they will be willing to complete the tasks and more students will do the assignment.

During the summer, students participate in a variety of events. Students go camping, travel to different places, and much more. All these activities that they are involved in could lead to very interesting projects. Students could write about visiting the Eiffel Tower or an essay on how to catch a fish. All these creative ideas can come out of letting students designed their own projects.

As kids students were thought the alphabet and their numbers through joyful and exciting ways. Whether it was watching Sesame Street and learning how to count or learning songs about the alphabet, learning was made in a way that they were expanding their knowledge with out evening being aware. Allowing students creative freedom on the project will led to these same results. The student will be expand their knowledge while having fun at the same time.

However, none of this matters if the student is not going to do the project. Summer vacation is viewed as a break off of school so students often will not do work. Providing students with the authority to create their own project insures the probability of them completing the task. Students tend to engage in activity that interest them, so allowing them to do so will make it more likely for the assignment to be completed.

Furthermore, if the schools are going to make students do a summer project, they should allow the student to decide what they want to do. This will lead to more students completing the task, creative ideas which each assignment handed in and the students will be expanding their knowledge while being excited to learn.
