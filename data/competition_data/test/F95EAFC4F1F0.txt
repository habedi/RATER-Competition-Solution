Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I think that making students who want to participate in sports or activities maintain a B average is wrong. There are various reasons why I think this. One reason is because if 35 percent of the students are used to maintaining a C average or maybe even as low as D average then it wouldn't be fair to them for you to make them have to suddenly have to start maintaining a B average. Another reason is because students may not understand the material that is being taught to them in one quarter of the year so their grades may go down. It wouldn't be fair for you to kick them off of or out of any sport or activity just because they are falling behind. My third and final reason is because not everyone is academically talented and to punish them for that is wrong. What if the work that they don't understand is causing them terrible stress and the only way for them to let it out is playing a sport, to put that to a screeching halt is pretty harsh don't you think?

The average for students to maintain should be a D because even though it may be a low grade they are still passing. Someone could have brought their D average up to a C average and they may feel very proud of themselves but then they would have to face being kicked off of the team or out of an activity and that could put them down a great deal. Maintaining a B all year long is unrealistic to some students. Teacher may grade in a specific way. What I mean by saying that is teachers may knock two points off of your average every time you miss a homework assignment or maybe even more. That would mean for students who miss over five homework assignments a quarter are knocked ten points off of their average.

What if, in one quarter, a student is quickly lagging behind and to catch up would be very close to impossible. Would they still have to be kicked of the activity they are taking part in? The material the teacher is teaching at the moment could be something the student just completely doesn't understand, are you going to make them suffer because of that? A student could be trying their absolute hardest to maintain a B average but they still are a couple points away from their goal, is that a reason to punish them? As a principal, these are some of the things you have to think about.

Not all students are academically talented. They may not be good at turning in assignments on time, passing tests, or completing class work. This could very much so affect their grade in their classes. Are you going to put them out of their activity because of it? This policy is bound to have a lot of angry students and many displeased parents. The school board might have to get involved and that causes a lot of extra stress among staff members.

Stopping students from participating in their activity because they are not maintaining a B average isn't the right thing to do. I think that the facts stated in this letter says so. Please rethink the policy and come up with a new plan.

Love, STUDENT_NAME
