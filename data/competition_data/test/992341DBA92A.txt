Dear Principal,

I STUDENT_NAME

think that we should bring cell phones to use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time, because during free time most of the time we are bored and we have nothing else to do and at lunch time sometimes you have no friends to talk to, so that's why you can just pull out your cell phone and text your friends or family. Also what if our parents have to tell us that we are a car rider? Or even if we have to ride the bus? Or we have a death in our family and they can't reach the school, they only have our cell number?

We're going to know those type of things.

Most of the time people do text you important things and the teacher just walks by and takes your phone not giving time for the student to explain or show them how important that message is. I would recommend that we should have our phones but only for important reasons.
