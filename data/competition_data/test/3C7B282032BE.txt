Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My point of view would be on requiring students to perform community service. This will do a lot of good for them inside as well as outside of school. For example, in tutoring we meet kids and also get to interact with them. Community Service also increases our chances of getting High School stuff out of the way. So basically it helps us as well as the kids we tutor and help. People who say it takes up time it actually doesn't it just that they are lazy or just don't want to help the community out and lend a hand. Its also that they might just not get along with children. They need to think about doing other things if they are the type of people that don't get along with kids. What they don't notice is that a lot of things they do now is community service they just don't realize it yet. Another example is like if you were walking home and saw an older citizen struggling to pick something up they might have dropped. If you cared you would go and pick it up for them and hand it to them. If they needed some help crossing the street you would expect more from your students than to just stand and watch. One good thing is that they would also get some good morals about life and they might feel good helping someone out. To just know that you did something good and helped someone its an awesome feeling. The more people give their time to help other, would most likely get acknowledged by good and well known company's because of that. Requiring community service in our school will also make and improve our social life with other schools. A lot of community service tells a lot about the person who is doing it and if its a school there might be a big possibility that there might be more students who care about the world and doing good for the community enrolling. So you should really consider making community service a required activity.

Your Student,
