Dear Principal,

I object to your thoughts about changing the school policy. You said that anyone under a B average cannot participate in any school activities. Being a C average girl myself, I think it is not fair. I mean if you have a C average at least your still passing right ? I understand anything lower than a C should not be aloud, but under a B is just stupid in my opinion. You also said that many students at your school are maintaining a C average. Therefore if you change the policy you will not have many students will you ? I'm pretty sure a lot of other students will agree with me too. Anyways I think the C average students should at least have the chance to bring their grades up and still participate. Because, it is quite unfair of you to punish the students who are still passing school. No, I'm not saying this because I have a school average of C, I'm saying because I just think it's unfair. I believe everyone should have a second chance. The failing students should have a second chance too, but their failing so their focuses shouldn't be on doing activities. They should be focusing on passing. This is just how I feel about it all.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
