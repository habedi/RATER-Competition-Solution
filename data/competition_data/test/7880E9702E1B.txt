Cell phones. from the moment they were invented, they have changed our way of communicating. We are now able to call distant relative, friends, etc. They come with many advantages at work, school, or on the road. Their is currently a dispute whether you should allow cell phones at school. You may think that they are misused at school by kids, there are kids who rely on their cell phones to get from school to their home.

When kids use their cell phones in class it is because they are bored. This may seem like a very serious problem but it is easily fixed. The teacher can give the students more active assignments that will keep the kids busy. If the kids are constantly working, they lower their use of their cell phone. Allowing the kids to use their cell phones during free times will also contribute to the problem in the classrooms.

Some of the kids need their cell phones if they cannot drive home. They will need their cell phone to quickly communicate to their parents and get home. They could also tell their parents that a friend will pick them up or they will be staying late. Taking away the students cell phones will cause confusion between the students and their worried parents. This confusion will make the job of the school staff tougher because they will be constantly be receiving phone calls from parents. I hope you will take my opinion under consideration.
