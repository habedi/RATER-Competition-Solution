Imagine you're at home sick and you're stressed about all the work you're missing from school, worried about how left behind you'll be. Many students would benefit from distance learning or online classes. Technology has taken a huge toll on our lives today and helping students with their education makes a big difference. Distance learning would be beneficial for students since they would be more likely to do their work and on their own time, won't fall behind when they're absent, and will be able to learn the material better.

When at home, students are more likely to get things done and do they're work. Being in a noisy classroom with other students constantly talking can be distracting, especially when trying to learn. With being able to attend classes from home, you can get your classwork done on you're own time, making it beneficial when having other things to do throughout the day. Many students have sports or a job and are not able to be in a classroom for eight hours. Being able to do your school-work when you choose has a big impact. Students can also do their work in a setting where they can learn best. Whether if that's sitting in a library or in your bed, being in a environment where you feel most comfortable in is important when getting things done.

Being absent from school can make a huge difference in your grades and cause you to fall behind in your classes. Online classes can change this. Students will be able to do their work from wherever they are. When students worry about missing school since they're absent, it can take a toll on their school-work and cause unnecessary stress. If you're home sick with the flu or even out with your family on vacation, distance learning can change that by being able to feel like you're in the classroom and not falling behind with just the use of a computer.

Online classes and video conferencing with your teacher helps most students learn much better. With video conferencing, students feel like their one-on-one with their teacher and are able to focus more. Classrooms can often be distracting due to other students talking or noises around the school. However, distance learning changes this. Teachers also may not be going the pace of a students liking, causing the student to get frustrated and fall behind. With video conferencing, students will be able to rewind the video and go the pace they need in order to learn the material. Attending classes from home can have a great impact on a student's learning.

Distance learning can have a positive impact with student's education due to them being more likely to do their work on their own time in a setting where they prefer, being caught up on their work when absent, and being able to learn the curriculum at their own pace. Students will benefit from online classes and schools everywhere should have this option. Being able to attend classes from home is an advantage today that we should take. With only needing the use of a computer, being able to take classes online is a great advantage that would benefit the young minds of students today.
