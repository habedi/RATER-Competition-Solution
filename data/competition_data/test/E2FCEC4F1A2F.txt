Some people think that the face was made by aliens well I'll tell you right here right now that the face you are looking at is not made by aliens but just a natural cause. I will be giving you many reason why this thing on the moon has no sighn or even romotely have anything to do with aliens. One reason that i find this face to be created by nature because even the earth has these kind of landforms just look at some of the mountains just really zoomed out. If there were aliens why wouldn't they made it more defined I mean if i make something i want it to look as real as I can make it and if you look at it closly you can tell that if aliens did make it why did they make it so bad like if it's just nature it looks beautiful but if something such as aliens made this im sorry but they did very poorly because if they can make pyrimids look a pretty as they do then i think they can manage a face or some sort on a place such as the moon. There is also another reason that i say there is no way the aliens made it, how can the pyrimids stay together as well as they did but on the face on the moon fell apart with in that short of time i mean look at it from 1998 to 2001 it looks like it a bomb went off and thats only 3 years what would it look like in 100 or even 20 years. Besides we dont have any hard core evidence that aliens actually exist. When they show me some hard core hands down evidence that i can look at and say "Wow you opened my eyes now I see what you have been talking about." Untill then I will always believe that the face on the moon was just a natural cause and that mother nature made that face.
