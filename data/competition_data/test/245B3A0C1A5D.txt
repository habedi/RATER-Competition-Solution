Venus, an extraordinary planet because of many reasons and fascinating things that goes further than our temporal limits, a very attractive planet that put our imagination to work due to our curiosity and the difficulties that Venus presents when it get time to explore. The planet called by the people as "The twin of the Earth" had being proving why is it so interesting enough to go and know more about it. We will see with the author´s text how Venus is a worthy planet to visit even with the kind of dangers that are possible to happen in Venus.

First of all Venus is a very hard place to review and investigate deeply. In the text we can see that Venus is in a first look inhospitable, 97 percent of its atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds are highly corrosive, the planet´s surface temperature average is 800 Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than Earth´s pressure. That is something that used to be different in the past where Venus looked like Earth´s enviroment. There used to be mountains, valleys, oceans etc. But all these impediments gets underpreciated when our curiosity grows each day, and in the text we can find the first steps of something that once used to be impossible to think and that´s a correct expedition to Venus. The NASA is looking for a way to send humans to study Venus. This way is to float above Venus. Conditions there are more survivable for humans. The pressure is a lot less, and radiaton levels is not greater than Earth´s radiation, the temperature is considerably lower than the surface temperature. Some scientific advantages have to be completed to at least have a safe investigation expedition such as in photography or video cameras because of low light levels in Venus. Samples of materials can´t be taken either from a far distance and Venus difficult enviroment. The author is convinced that some day the human will be able to do a research in Venus and its convincement is reflected on how he wrote the 6th paragraph where the author says, "Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to las long enought to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." is giving a small amount of hope to keep track in the research of new technologies to have the key to travel Venus and explore it.
