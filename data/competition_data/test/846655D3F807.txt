One time Generic_Name was in summer school and his teacher assigned him a project. He raised his hand and asked the teacher if the project was supposed to be student-designed or teacher-designed. The teacher said it will be teacher-designed because he thinks the students will slack off. Student-designed projects are to help students tell others about themselves. Student-designed projects help students and teachers to a greater good.

Although some believe the summer projects should be teacher-designed because students do not have to come up with their own ideas, others believe the summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want, it allows teachers to learn more about the students, and it allows students to be themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want, it allows teachers to learn more about the students, and it allows students to be themselves.

First, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want. For example, students will become more interested in the project if it is about what they want. Therefore, they will put more effort and more time into the project because they get to express themselves. If the students came up with the project idea then it is axiomatic they will complete the project. The project ideas the students choose directly reflects upon them, which means there is a higher chance they will be entitled to completing it. Furthermore, a student-designed project creates a sense of freedom in the students mind. To add to, if students get freedom on projects, then their academics will most likely skyrocket. In summary, student-designed summer projects encourage students to complete it with hard work and perseverance.

Second, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the teachers to learn more about the students. These projects give off a sense of how the teachers should treat the students. For example, if the student does poorly on the project and is very weak in presenting, then the teacher should know what to do. The teacher should gather the information and come to a conclusion which states that the student needs help. However, if a student does a really emotional and heart touching project then the teacher should get involved. The teachers should try and communicate with the students and sympathize towards them, and maybe even take it a little easy on them since they are going through a tough time. If a student presents a project which is reflecting on their past and the obstacles they overcame, then the teacher should ask questions. In other words, they should try and learn more about the students past, so the teachers will have an understanding of how they can help the students in the future. To put it all together, student-designed summer projects should be a way for the teachers to truly learn and understand about how the students are where they are.

Third, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the students to be themselves. For example, students should feel free about doing a project. They should not have to be held to a standard which they might never get to. Teachers should rather help the students get to the standard rather than just telling the students they have to get there. In projects, students should be able to talk about whatever they choose to. They should not have to be limited to one project idea. To add to, limiting what students have to do a project is how their grades start to drop. One of the most important thing a student should be able to do on a student-designed summer project is to express their feelings and talk about what their heart tells them to do. The whole point of a student-designed project should be to help students talk about what is bothering them instead of limiting them to one idea. In one idea, student-designed summer projects should be a way for students to be unique and different in a world where everyone is trying to be like each other.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are a way for students to express their deepest feelings and their wildest dreams. If summer projects are student-designed, then teachers will know how each student should be taught. Students should confront their teachers and tell them why their summer projects should be student-designed.
