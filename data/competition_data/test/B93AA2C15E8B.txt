dear TEACHER_NAME, i don't think that all people should do community service because i think that if all students do this it is a waste of time because when were in school were either learning something or we are doing an elective and we don't need to do community service cause that's other peoples jobs like court ordered. i also think that community service would be a waste of time because there's not that much trash on our campus and making us go off campus to pick up someone's trash is for sure a waste of time where we could be doing something else cause that would be better than picking up trash for an hour.

i wont deny that it would be good but its just that its kind of boring to pick up trash, sure its good for everything and everyone but i think that's just somebody else's job to worry about. i don't think that this could happen though because if it did how would you make it happen? if you did it would most likely have to be a before school or after school thing but who on earth would join some club that says "the picking up trash club" i don't think anyone would join that club because who wants to pick up trash all day? not me.

there's also another reason why we shouldn't do this, because there's a person in charge of picking up trash in schools and that's the janitors, I'm not being mean or anything but its true and the person that's in charge of picking up trash out side is the garbage people. if this did happen which its unlikely because of so many classes during the day that i don't think that this could possibly happen because its just unlikely. there are thousands of reasons that there shouldn't be a community service at our school because its a waste of time and there are millions of reasons why we shouldn't but that doesn't mean its a bad thing.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
