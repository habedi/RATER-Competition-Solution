During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more effective regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.

To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more effective and helpful for a student in the long run.

Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more effective. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.

Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more effective regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may effectively design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more effective if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be effectively prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also effectively make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.

As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more effective than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more effective, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.
