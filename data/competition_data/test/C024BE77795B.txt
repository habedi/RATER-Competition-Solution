Middle school is supposed to have more freedom to pick and choose for classes,and clubs. If the principal says we must pick an extracurricular activity, it would take away the sense of freedom to choose. So i'm going to voice my opinion that it's our choice,also it makes the principal look bad,and that it takes away our own time.

We came to this school because its gives us more freedom to choose than elementary school. Now the choice seem more like a duty and make this experience less interesting. If I had to pick a extracurricular activity it feel like a normal class not a fun hobby or an interest. Then when i get a job using the skill from an extracurricular activity I most likely hate my job.

It also not so good towards the principal. It would make me feel forced and oppressed to do this activity. I'd feel obliged or it feel like a chore more than fun and intriguing. The principal look like a tyrannical ruler to the students.

Also it called

EXTRA

curricular activities. Infecense on extra which means not reqiuredÂ or more time. It should be our own time to use however we want and not to be consumed by these

EXTRA

curricular activitys. If I have practive of the same day as the

EXTRA

curricular activity and it cuts into my practice time do stay so my grade not effected or do I go and work on my dream/goals

So im hoping after this you will let us choose and make our own decisions.
