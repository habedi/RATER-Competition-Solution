Students who take classes online don't get the full education they want to get during school. Online classes show that students have to learn everything on their own, this affects students because they don't have access to a teacher that can guide them when the student it struggling. Having to take a class online may affect students social life because they have to sit in front of a screen all day. Taking classes online isn't beneficial because students don't get to fully understand the subject when they are forced to learn it themselves, students don't get to have as much of a social life because they do their work on a screen while others are in school throughout the day, although, others may argue that taking online classes are helpful for students.

Online classes can be a huge struggle for some students because, not all students can teach themselves a class they need a teacher to help them learn the subject more. The class online may be easier for some teachers to do, students don't get to learn as much as the kids in the classroom do. Online classes deprive students of getting the classroom feel. In the classroom students get to practice the subject they are learning about, while online students don't, they have to learn one thing and move on to the next, they aren't given anytime to process what they just learned and how they are able to use it in their daily lives. Students also don't get to use their creativity to give themselves a fun learning experience, for example, doing labs in science class, or having to do group projects, taking an online class takes the creative aspect away from students. Having an art class let students express how they feel and being able to show off what they are capable of. Taking an online school won't let you do that because, students won't be hands on with the projects, and they won't get the full experience if they just with a video of it online. Having to take an online class can also affect students social life, and missing out on after school activities.

When students have to take an online class, they tend to lose connections with people because, taking classes online keeps students inside their house, and when they want to go out and be with their friends, most are in school during the day. Not being able to interact with people, that don't live in your house, can affect a lot of students. This can affect a lot of students because, no one wants to stay stuck in a house all day, they want to go out and have fun with their friends, but when they are stuck inside doing school connections tend to get lost, Students interacting with people outside their own family helps them be a better person as they grow, it teaches them how to talk to certain people in certain settings, and it allows them to understand how other people work. Students also do not get to participate in extra curricular activities because they take school online. Being able to play a sport, or be apart of a club is a big part of the school experience, no student wants to miss out on that. Having clubs and sports expands the people students talk to and their social skills are broadened because of the amount of people they meet. Taking those extra curricular s show colleges that they are well rounded, and are capable of doing other things then just school work,However some may debate how taking online classes actually help students.

Others may say taking online classes is beneficial for students because they get to learn the subject at their own speed. In a classroom setting some teacher go through subjects extremely quickly which tends to hurt some students. The students don't get to fully learn the subject the way they want to, so taking school online will help that child immensely. When a student is ill, they tend to miss a lot of school so having the luxury of taking online school can help those kids in the long run. Online classes can help students figure out what they want to do with their life, because kids that have to go to school 8 hours a day don't get to think about what they want to pursue, or where they want to go. While the kids taking the classes online get to know exactly what they are going to do because they took the unessacary classes online, and they don't have to go through that struggle of wasting their time.

Students who take online classes aren't able to get the full classroom experience. They don't get to have someone guide them when they are struggling, they have to learn and understand the subject themselves. Online classes do not help students when they want to learn new things because it will just confuse them more and they will struggle to finish the class at a decent amount of time. Students not having the access to a teacher when they need it can cause the student to fail the class, or to not fully understand what the class is asking of them. Students don't get to have as much of a social life because other students are in school during the day, so they don't get to go out as much. Others may argue that being able to do classes online can help the students who are unable to attend school, but they still don't get to use their creativity when doing group projects and other fun school activities.
