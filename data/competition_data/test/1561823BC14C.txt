In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and how he was saying different things about how Venus is and was shows that he really does have an interest in studying Venus and he defends his argument well because he goes into detail on what he wants to do and what he wants to know.

Although the passage is having to do with exploring Venus theres nothing much said about them doing things because they failed multiple times and by the looks of it I don't think its going to happen because of how the author talks about Venus.

The author seems to be doing everything he could to actually try to explore Venus despite the difficulties they are having, that even if it is dangerous the author will still try to do something about it.

In my opinion I think what the author's doing is very dangerous because he doesn't know what the outcome is going to be, it could go both good and bad because there is a possibility that anything can happen, as said in the article though, they are only looking at sending technology to try to explore Venus not humans so it wouldn't be as dangerous and I think thats why the author is still open on exploring it and not giving up so he can try to find some answers to what hes been questioning.

In the last paragraph (8) the author states that the challenge presented by Venus has value because of human curiosity because it will lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors and just basically saying to think of it as an imagination but at the same time something you can do and want to achieve.

In conclusion if the author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit then that's what hes going to go for, some people are also curious on that and so the author trying to do that will be helpful to others and himself and if he does succeed others will be satisfied with what the author came up with besides the dangers the study presents I do think that it will all be worth it at the end of the day, because that's a goal they've been trying to accomplish for sometime now.
