Have you ever wanted to be a sea cowboy? If so let me tell you a little about it. Being a sea cowboy can be a lot of fun but also a lot of hard work.

Being a sea cowboy is alot of fun.

I mean if you love animals especally horses than this is the job for you. You get to be with horses and feed them. Horses are vert nice and big cuddly animals. If you are an animal lover especally a horse lover and a cattle lover than you should enroll. If you lived on a farm or worked in one and found it somewhat fun taking care of horses than this is the job for you .

If you enroll you can also be all around the world like the first time I went I went to Europe and even China after some time. If you like traviling than this is the job for you. If you like being on a boat than this is the perfect job foe you. If you like being on a boat and love animals especially horses and sea animals than this is a good place for you becuse you might even get to see some dolphins and other sea animals. And if you get bored of looking at the water or searching for sea animals don't worry you still have horses and cows.

Once you unload the animals you can still stay active even if you dont have to clean the stalls or bruch them. For instance on my way back i got to play volleyball and baseball. We would play games and everything.

This is NOT a boring job. For instance you get to be in the outdoors or indoors, you get to be with animal, and you also can be looking out in the sea.

This even counts as a military service like for me it also did. After i enrolled they told me that I could stay there and it would count as my service.

So like i said before this is NOT a boring job, you get to be with animals, it is very fun, you get to be all around the world, you can stay active even after you unload the animals, you get to play games, and it counts as your military service. So if you find your self liking this job than you should enroll.
