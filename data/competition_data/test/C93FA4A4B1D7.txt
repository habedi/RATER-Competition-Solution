This article is mostly about NASA and it's discovery of the face on Mars they believe that the face had a human form, but they figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. NASA thought it had unsual shadows to make it look like a Egyption Pharaoh, a few days later after the discovery Nasa unvieled the image for all to see. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows- even haunted grocery checkout lines for 25 years-some people think the Face is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide.

Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, and so on April 5, 1998, when MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture of the face. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL we site, revealing ...a natural lndform. There was no alien monument after all. Mission controllers prepared to look again.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, MGS drew close enough for a second look and got a much better photo of the Viking photo. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. There are mant reasons why the face could have been made by aliens or if it was made by something else most likely it was aliens in my poinion, but we need proof to be able to determine if it was or not.

The article is just saying that there could be alien life out there, because there is so much that is undiscovered an things we do not know about, so it is possible that it was aliens or if it was something else think about it what do you think about all this?
