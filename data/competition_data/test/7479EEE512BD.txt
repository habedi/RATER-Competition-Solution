Some may say right now, at the start of 2015, the whole world is at a peak for technology, cars, and advancements. Some are saying differently. In this day and age, many countries, also can't afford any more pollution than they already have, due to how many vehicles there are on the road. Some cities have even stopped using cars all together, and have been very sucessful. All of these reasons help further prove the point of how limiting car usage could really be an advantage in today's society.

Are the peak of vehicles in the United States over? In the past, people predicted flying cars for 2015, but no one predicted a downfall in vehicles all together. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, "the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after... As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the contry was in January 1995." So overall, less driving seems to becoming a trend.

Pollution caused by the gas of cars is a huge issue in today's society. Some cities are finally taking action. "Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" (Robert Duffer). Few may argue with this, saying that these sort of bans are not fair, delvery companies aren't able to work, or a some may argue about the fine of 31 dollars you're charged if your vehicle is on the road is riduculous. But, "the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban"(Robert Duffer).       Â
