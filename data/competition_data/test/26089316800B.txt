Dear principal,

In this paper i will tell you the differences about forcing the students to do community service or making it optional and which one a prefer and is more fair.

I do not think that making students do community service is a good thing because if the student is not a helping kind of person then it shouldn't be right to make them do it because it will just make them miserable and the job wont be done right. For example if you make kids walk the younger ones to the bus and they don't want to do that then they might be mean to the kids and the kids will go home and complain to their parents and then the school will be responsible.

Instead you should make it an optional thing because if people want to do community service then they will do it right and everyone will be happy. For example if you make students pick up trash that actually want to be helpful then they will be sure to do the job right and then the principal and everyone will be happy because the ground will look nice and it wont look trashy.

That is why i think making community service optional is a better choice for the students and organization or school.
