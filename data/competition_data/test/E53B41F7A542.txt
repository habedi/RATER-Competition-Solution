To the principal

Community service is a great thing to do it makes you feel good and it also helps build character for example it can build leadership skills. I think that students should at least have to do one community service project because then they can see if they like it they might change and start doing even more community service. Another thing it does is if the students don't like doing community service projects and its not the thing for them at least they gave it a shot and helped out people during their time.

You should have kids do some community service projects because it builds character. Lets say your a kid who doesn't like to help out or is really sad all the time by helping out those in need you can feel really good about helping those people. Another thing is if your not a good leader and maybe you are picked as a leader for the project it would give you a chance to build you leadership skills. I wasn't really into community service projects but I helped out once cooking with my dad for a party at the senior center and i felt really good once i was done.

For those kids who still don't like community service projects they should still be happy that they managed to help out those who really need it that's more meaningful than sitting on the couch and watching television all day. Also for those kids who don't like community service projects you should still urge them to try it again and maybe after a while they'll grow on the idea of helping out those in a time of need. Students who don't like doing community service should still be acknowledged for their effort and maybe that could possibly be a motivator to try it again.

As you can see we have kids who do like to do community service projects and kids who don't. I think you should require the students to at least do one community service project. You should do this because it can help build some character and leadership skills and it may turn kids who don't like to do that kind of work and maybe make them want to try community service again.
