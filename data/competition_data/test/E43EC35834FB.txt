What is Venus? In paragraph one, Venus is the closest planet to earth and often they known as Earth's "Twin." And according to the article, Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any planet in our solar system. A thick atmoshphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venus also has similar features to Earth. Such as Mountains, valleys, craters and others.

According to the author, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the troubles it may presents. In the article from paragraph five, The National Aeronautics and Space administration known as "NASA" has an interesting idea of sending humans to study more about Venus. They allow scientist to float above the fray while seeing the rolling Venusian landscape. Just as how jet airplanes fly at the higher attitude, passing the storms and also that way, they could stay safe far away from Venu's surface area. Since it is dangerous to be on Venus surface area, researchers could not take any samples of rock, or gas, or anything that's on the planet.

In conclusion, it is a worthy exploration and it is somewhat important to learn more about Venus. So that way, we could also discover things that we haven't yet discover and study from it. As it said on the article, in the very last paragraph, Venus is challenging to all of us. Because not only the facts that it attracts scientist and researchers out there, it also lead human curiosity to explore more about it.
