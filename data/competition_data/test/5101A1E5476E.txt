The face on mars is really just a butte; that is just a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. NASA has even proved that with the first pucture. But people still didnt beleave them.

Science can prove this by taking pictures every few years to see the diffrance. In the oragnle photo in 1976 it does look like a face but, that was from 1976. Then in 1998 they took a other photo and it dosnt look like a face at all but, people still didnt beleave them so in 2001 they took one more picture, and it revealed it is just a mesa in the martian area of Cydonia. In Cydonia there are many mesas and buttes.

So that proves that the martian face is really a mesa. But you will still come up with awsers for the missing fetures like a ¨cloud¨ in the way, so the camraes couldnt get a good image. So like I said before NASA sent a other probe to get a good image and it was in 2001, and it pleased the publuc.
