I believe studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky, its reffered to as Earth's "twin", and this planet is so inhospitable that a spacecraft couldn't survive a landing for more than a few hours. In this passage it explains all of the faults of a planet so close to us. The planet Venus, has weather issues and is one of the brightest points in our solar system. Although it can seem dangerous to even want to explore this planet, it has its reasons why it should be explored.

This planet is a planet NASA has attempted to explore. Due to the conditions of Venus they have failed to learn very much. It has been 30 years since a spaceship has touched down on venus. In paragraph 3, it states, "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus." It then goes on to explain the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are not suitible for humans on Earth. With these issues, scienticts are still ready to know more about this planet. The author shows even though the planet has many faults, these are the things scientists need to discover and understand.

Venus is often reffered to as our planet Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest to our is density and size. In paragraph 4, the author says Venus is the most Earth like planet. They believe Venus was covered with oceans and could have supported forms of life as Earth is able to. Venus also has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes on its surface. The weather on Venus is similar to some of the weather we get on Earth. Scientists want to see how many more similarities Venus has with Earth. Venus could also have a species more capable of their contitions.

Venus is also one of the brightest points of light in our night sky. "Evening Star," which is another nickname for Venus, makes it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus being one of the planets closest to us and one of the few planets almost anyone cansee even from home makes it easier and easier to find reasons that scientists feel the need to explore such places. My own classmate herself once told me "We need to start learning more about Venus. It could mean so much to have knowledge of our sister planet."

I believe studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, Venus is one of th brightest points in the sky, it is reffered to as Earth's "twin," and this planet is so inhospital that a spacecraft could'nt survive a landing for more than a few hours. In the passage, the author shows evidence to support their reasons as to why Venus has value. All the reasons listed show how Venus can be of value to scientists. It is important for the scientists to understand why the weather is the way it is and how similar Venus is to Earth. We could live there or we could meet a new species. Knowing everything about Venus could benifit and change so much about science today!
