Dear. Principal

I think that students should do community service i got three good reasons why we should do it first it helps our earth to be better planet , second people might think this school is clean ,third it helps students like us to be clean. Now i going to give you the details about the first , second and third reasons .

The first reason i chose this one because in earth the earth oceans they have been litter 25% percent in our ocean have been litter. Cause rain pulls the trash in the beach, in the river that might cost all contamination in our supply of water. Then people might be sick the entire week so this great reason us students should help.

second if we don't have a mess the our might think that this school is clean that they even show respect on the principal. Even if professor TEACHER_NAME might give this school a raise on the new cool stuff we can get. we might put teams of four to clean one side of the school so i could be faster because the more groups you get the faster you clean this school of litter . So this is another great idea to do community service .

Third it show how clean and mature we are on responsibility's it might help's us be better adults then others. Then will be less job for the people who help clean this school. The better mature we are the better the help we a
