The author suggests that we continue our studying on venus, even though the planet gets really hot at 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than earths. But most people believe that venus might have bee covered in oceans at one point and could of had many different life froms on its planet.

The author is trying to say that if we continue our studying on venus and if we land more spaceships on venus we might be able to find out if oe day we could live there or if one day we could send men and women up there to find out if there was some sort of life forms and if the planet once held many differnet stuff that we didnt know that existed.

The author also informed us, readers that venus has the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system. astronomers are also discussing if venus could in habit more life forms if they figure out what could be worn or if life forms could live on venus. The author then explains the terrain of venus and its rocky sediment, and its valleys, mountains, and craters. and then also explains that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit and crucial consideration given the long time frames and space travel.
