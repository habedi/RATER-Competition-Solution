Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that we should have Policy 2. If we were to use our cell-phones during lunch or free time there would be a rise of Cyber bullying, it will lead to people getting there cell-phones stolen, and it is a big distraction. All of my reasons for Policy 2 are about the safety and education of the students here at SCHOOL_NAME. So we should go with Policy 2 because there would be a rise of Cyber bullying in the school, people would have there cell-phones stolen, and it is a big distraction.

One reason why I believe that the school should follow Policy 2 is that there would be a rise in Cyber bullying. Cyber bulling is the use of technology to bully someone. Would you not think that if a school yard bully got his hands on a cell-phone that he/she would try to pass his or her aggression on by using a text or phone call? Cyber bulling is dangerous and should not be taken lightly. I am not saying that Cyber bulling will happen but there is just to big of a risk.

Another reason of mine that I think that Policy 2 would be the best choice is that cell-phones will be constantly getting lost or stolen. Not every family wants their child to have a cell-phone. And if they don't have one there going to look at every one else and get jealous. Also cell-pones now a days are small. If they fall out of your pocket or book bag it could take a long time for it to reaper. You'd have to file the report and it would be oh so time consuming. There should be no cell-phones in school because they are easy to lose and easy to get stolen.

The third reason why we should have Policy 2 is because they are to much of a distraction. I would love just to whip my cell-phone every time I wanted to call one of my friends, but that is to distracting. We come to school every day to get an education; not to talk with friends. Students grades would start to suffer because they couldn't stop thinking about what there peers are doing. So cell-phones are a distraction and that is why they should not be in school.

I have showed you my three reasons why we should follow Policy 2. They will lead to a rise of Cyber bulling, would be constantly getting lost or stolen, and are a distraction.
