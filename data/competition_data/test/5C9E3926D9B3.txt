Are aliens real or just a myth? Aliens have supposedly done many things on the planets. The question is, did the aliens create The Face on Mars? Or is The Face just a natural landform on Mars? There are many theories on which one is true.

The Face on Mars is just a natural landform on Mars. There is a theory that has been going around for centuries, that aliens created The Face. Many people will believe whatever they hear on T.V. or anything that draws the media attention. People forget that they need facts and or evidence proving something. Otherwise it will only ever be consindered a theory.

Mars happens to be like Earth in many ways. There was once water on the red planet. That has facts to back it up. Mars is believed to have once held life, it may or may not be true. NASA is still working on whether or not Mars had life there once. Yet, since Mars is our sister planet, also may have common characteristics. As in there natural landmarks. But, if there is actual proof on aliens, maybe they did make The Face.
