Summer projects should be teacher designed because it would be a much neater process than having student designed ones. When you have a project made by a teacher you have a rubric that makes it easier. When you have a student designed project it has a rubric but its very different than the on that would be for a teacher designed one because all the students won't have the same project prompt they will all have different types of projects because they would all get to choose their own prompts and they will all have a different quality to them that can vary across many different subjects unlike one that is teacher designed which can be one or two different subjects which make it easier to keep the grading process less taxing on the teachers. An example that comes directly from my life s that for English we had to write a paper and it could ve anything that we waned but the teacher had to approve it and most people got approved of right away but a small amount of people had to do different ones because they were not approve which made it harder form them because it was a thing they were not really interested in which made they grade lower than it could have been because my grade was low for a paper in that class because I choose a bad thing that did not have enough info about it online but if that was a teacher designed project than I feel like would have done better on that paper than I did do

Another example of this working is the writing sol because it only has a small amount of prompts to keep people from getting the same one every year and it gives variety for the students doing it. Having a teacher designed one is also easier because it gives you a clear cut view of what needs to be done and how to get it done and what resources that you need to get it done unlike a student designed one because then you would have to research something to do than you have to get that topic approved by the teacher and tan you have to do the project but if your topic gets denied than you have to do the process all over again. Summer projects should be teacher designed to make it easier on the students and the teachers.
