In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus"

I have a couple of reasons why it is worthy pursuit and a few reasons why it isn't a worth pursuit, but I will stick to the reaons why it is a worthy pursuit. There are many reasons and challenges of leaving our own planet to go visit and explore another planet, but with the right midset and will power anything is possible.

A couple of reasons why it would be a worthy pursuit to go to Venus is because it could show us what Earth will look like if we keep abusing our planet. The reason I say this is because in paragraph 3 it states that the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide. This really popped out to me because people on Earth are saying global warming and the main reason of that is carbon dioxide from cars. Another reason this would be a worthy pursuit is that scientist can study the planet with their own eyes. The reason that would bepossible is that because NASA had an idea that we have a blimp like object be about 30 miles or so above the ground and scientist would be able to study what a planet like our own cold end up like.

In conclusion, if this decision was up to me I would find a way to send scientist to Venus to study it. I also feel like this would help make a change in the way we live our lives to help prevent something like this to happen to our own planet.
