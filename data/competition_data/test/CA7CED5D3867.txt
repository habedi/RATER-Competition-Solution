Luke Bumberger didn't have an clue that he will ride waves. Before he started riding waves he work a partime job at the grocery store and bank , his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat he wouldnt say no because he knew it was a lifetime opportunity. In 1945 WORLD WAR TWO was over in Europe and many towns and countries was left in ruins. To help those countries recover their food supplies, animals 44 natoions joined together to form UNRRA the United Nations relief Rehabilitation Administration hired the seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke always wanted to ride waves because it opended up the world for him he said im grateful for the opportunitys, before luke and his family host a number of international students and exchange visitors for lots of years he said I found time to have fun on board the cowboys played table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. But after Luke realized after being a Seagoing Cowboy he wanted everyone else to ride waves ,and explore and have fun while doing it so that's why him and his parents wanted to host students to be succeful and succed in life and to do what they dreamed.
