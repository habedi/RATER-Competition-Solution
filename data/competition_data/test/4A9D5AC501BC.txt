Students in the modern day classroom have a lot of problems , whether that be Mental illness affecting them or just work that is just piling up from sick days. Some students just cant keep up and some have even dropped out because of it. Therefore I wanted to address something , should students be able to take video classes from home ? Yes and here are the reasons why .

Many students in the modern day classroom have many things that can make their school work quantity and quality decline. For instance many students are Anti Social , this means a couple things . It could just be they don like interactions with other people , or they could fear social interaction and it causes great stress upon them. I propose this , we should give students that have this another option. We could have them take online classes. I know this deviates from school norms , but please just ponder this for a moment , isnt school supposed to be about learning. Yes yes it is and so what if that means that some students learn better from home. Who are we to deny them the right to learn where they feel comfortable. It just makes sense , let them learn how they do best and offer them options. That way our scores can go up and students wouldnt have to be stressed all the time. We should see this as a win for the schools and a win for the students.

The next point I would like to make is , that online video classes could allow students who have to work to finish their education even if they might be forced out of the school to provide for a family or any other reason that requires a student to work. This can and will be a major advantage to these students and should be implemented soon and very soon , But of course this dose not only benefit the students it also benefits the schools. Ponder this if schools get funding based on how good the students test scores are , why wouldnt the school provide them a service that could help keep scores up . Then the schools would get more funding and many more students could graduate with a chance to earn higher incomes all because they got their high school diploma. I see this as not just a win for the schools or students but for everyone including the country's economy.

Furthermore students during a school year can suffer from a variety of illnesses ranging from the Flu to mental illnesses , and this may require them to take some time off. Sometimes the days off can range from 3-14 days off. This is a lot of school time that cannot really be caught up with in class. Sure you can learn the concepts from youre work , but what if the teacher taught some kind of method to help but dose'nt include them in the work. This is what online video classes would solve and eventually put an end to. Students from their own home could while they are in bed take notes from the class the day before or even that very days class. This is a huge help to every sick student and need I say it again should be implemented very very soon.

As we all know some students just dont work well in a modern classroom environment whether it be from the reasons above or not. Maybe they could have ADHD or ADD but that dosent matter. They should still receive an education like everyone else , and should they find that they dont really work well in a modern classroom then schools should offer them an out that will help them out , the same goes with people with ADD. People with anger issues could also reap he rewards from these classes too , maybe they get irritated easily and are prone to lashing out . In that case maybe they might learn better from home while they work with a professional to learn how to conquer their anger and maybe if they feel like they can handle it . They could resume in class school and just go about the rest of their time there and it could be like they never left.

Now before I end my discussion about this subject , I would like to introduce a counter argument that many may have on the issue of online classes. A lot of people seem to think that students are just lazy , and if offered online classes they will just skip them and not do them. I would like to dash this misconception right now. Most students are not lazy in fact most of the hardest working people I know are students and trust me they work hard. Most of us in fact are just stressed as I mentioned before. We may just seem slow and unmotivated but thats just the stress from school showing , but trust me all that slow movement and everything will change once we get around our friends or once we start doing the things we love. whether that be playing video games to writing or maybe even off road racing. But please remember not all of us are lazy , but im not saying some of us arent lazy we all have our moments , after all we are human beings.

In conclusion these classes would help everyone regardless of them being lazy and just wanting to stay home. We also have to remember that some students just cant bring themselves to get out of bed much less the house possibly to do with mental illness or sickness , but what ever the case the school should respect that and these online classes would still make sure they get the education they need to succeed in life. The workers could also focus more on making money and less on the struggles brought about by school as work is enough stress already. We cant forget about those students who dont work well in classrooms , it helps them just as much as the rest of us. As we can see from my arguments above the numerous advantages far outnumber the disadvantages of online video classes. I highly encourage schools to implement this alternative method of teaching to greatly improve the classroom environment. Also if the schools play their cards right they may even earn higher test scores and more and more funding to help rebuild anything the schools need repaired or maybe even provide more programs to help students. I now rest my case as to why I feel online video classes should be allowed good day.
