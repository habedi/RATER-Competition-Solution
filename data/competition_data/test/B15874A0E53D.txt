I think it is such a great idea , That school diced to offer distance as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing . for example; if any of the students sick or have issues to come to school online classes will be the best way to catch up on school. which is going to make life is more easy for the people who dose not go to school, or have a problem to go to school. I'm sure would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. last year I took Arabic online because for a fact my school don't offer that ,so I diced to take it online . It was so helpfully for me I learned so much. Thats why I think all schools should offer online classes .Even the research shows online classes helped 89% student to catch up on schools . This why think all the schools should offer distance learning as an option for student attend classes from home .There is also a problem for online classes because some of the student they can make there gardens do the work for them or a friends which means they are cherries .
