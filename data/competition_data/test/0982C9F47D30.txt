OMG! My favorite show is on , and its called , " Bring It"! My favorite part of the show is when they yell " DD4L ". That show makes me want to ask the principal at my school to make all students participate in one extracurricular activity. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives you time to make new friends , and have fun.

First, students could make new friends while doing these extracurricular activities. For example, i'm on the step team, and sense i've been up there I have gained a outrageous number of friends . Many people may not have friends, but what the principal is doing is a generous way to make new friends.

Also, students could have fun while participating in these extracurricular activities. For instance, I just recently joined an majorette group, and while i'm at practice , I really be enjoying myself. Joining new teams can be scary, but its worth a try. Once you join a team you will never regret it.

In conclusion , I for once agree with the principal decisions. Joining extracurricular activities could have you having new friends , and fun , in no time. This way you wouldn't think school is atrocious. You should join some extracurricular activities , so you can make new friends , and have fun.
