Schools around the globe have been offering distance learning classes as an option. Students would take classes at home by video calls with teachers. There is a lot of talk of whether distance learning is a good or bad idea for students. There are many pros and cons to this idea and for that, it is hard to tell. Students feel more comfortable in their own home and lessen stress. Though, students need social interaction and routine in their teen years; therefore, it is not the greatest idea.

While this idea sounds good in the first place and lots of students might want to take distance learning over going to school, it offers no social interaction to students. Social interaction with peers is one of the biggest elements to growing up, and if that is taken away they become a completely different person. While distance learning can take away stress and can let students pace their day by how they want it, it takes away one vital point of a growing teenager's life. Stress can also teach lessons of time management. Some also say there is an experience to attending school and it sticks with you for the rest of your life. If you take that away, you are taking away an experience that all students should live with for their whole lives.

The act of waking up in the morning, getting ready for school, and going through the day on a schedule gives a routine for students. Without a routine, students would learn how to be productive or manage time. It gives something for students to do and follow, and without one they would just be doing nothing at home with no idea on how to spend their time.

A school classroom usually have an amount of around 15 to 30 students in each classroom. If distance learning became standard and everyone used it, that would put a lot more work on teachers. Every student would need their own teachers, and if that were to happen you would need up to 30 times the amount of teachers there are now. Distance learning will always be limited and not every student will be able to have access to this.

Although, it can sound like a great idea to students, distance learning doesn't encourage social interaction with peers or routine to keep them moving. School is much more important to students other than academic reasons. Going to school gives many attributes and teaches students an uncountable amount of valuable lessons that are very important to them when they grow older.
