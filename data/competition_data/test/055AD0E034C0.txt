Car usage is a big deal it is killing are planet and are kids before us. We need to cut back on driving everywere, if you live in town then get a bike if all your doing is going to get some milk, or picking up some extra toilet paper. You dont have to drive everywere but if you do have to go long distance then car pull. I believe, this is just a theory but I do believe that this world will die and everything in it will burn to the ground if we dont do soething aout how mch driving we do everywere back and forth.

The first thing is get a bike people dont believe in walking or riding a bike anymore. They think that you can drive everywere but one day nothing will work no cars no planes just your two feet and a bicycle if that. Everything will just be a pile of scum when the apocalyps happens. The only way to delay it woud be to limit the usage of cars and dont drive if you dont have to, and dont drive 3 cars somewere if you can all fit in one. So what im trying to say is stop waisting this world away and go green.

They have cars now a days that will blow your mind they even have eletric powered cars no gases to polute the air. My air your air car companys are being smart and making cars that are fuel eficiount, or they dont run off fuel at all. It sounds good but if you really think about  it it probably uses just the same amount of gases to make these extremely perfected cars. For instance, I was watching a tv show yesterday and this guy was killing people because they was driving a "gas guzzler" and he cared so much about his envorment that he  would literaly take there life because that ment so much to him. I would never do this but theres some psychos out there thats for sure.

Last but not least the mass of how much people drive, it is rediculous. People drive just to go get their mail box to get mail, thats sad I dont care who you are thats ridiculous. Also when people go hunt they ride fourwheelers why would they ride a fourwheeler to be with nature thats kind of defieing being with nature. Why would you go out in nature and kill it by rideing your fouwheeler. If this keeps happening the world will be no more. Because all the polution for the exaust from all of the motorized vehicles is slowly but surely killing planet earth.

In contrary to all of this, none of this will ever happen in mine or your life time. Because the earth is a amazing God made thing. And it will last as long as he wants it to. Just like all the American money in God we trust. But im not woried about my generation im woried about thee ones before me. I will be just fine but my kids kids are the ones im worried about. Thank you for your timee.
