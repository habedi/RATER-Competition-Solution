The author said that " twin venus is the closest planet to earth" that proves that he is saying that the planet is closer to us and could potentally be more dangerous. He also said "Not a single space ship has touched down on venus in more than three decades" this also shows that they are trying to figure out a way to be able to touch the planet without injuring more people. The author said that "no space craft lasted more than a few hours" its really not safe that people are still tring to go on the planet but, some really want to be able to. The author says that "studying venus is a worthy prosuit" and i agree with him because people are going to start to get curious and there needs to be a way by now that we should be able to get on the planet without blowing up in the few minures we are on there. In conclusion i think that we should be able to get on venus and i think we should find more safe ways to be able to do it. Yes i agree with the author
