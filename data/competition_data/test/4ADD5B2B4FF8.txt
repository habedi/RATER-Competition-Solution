Dear Principal,

As a member of the student body, I would like to talk to you and express my feelings on you changing the policy to participate in sports or other activities to having a grade B average. Many of our student have a C average, and changing the policy would mean that they wouldn't be allowed to participate in sports or other activities. I think this policy would be unfair. Not only would we have smaller participation in sports activities, but also in school activities. Our sport's teams would fall in numbers and our school functions would be lame and boring, because attendance would be down. So why not change the policy to at least a grade C average? I think this would be more fair to all the students. It would push the students below a C average to achieve something more and improve their grade, and the students above a C average to maintain or slightly improve their grade.

Making the requirement a C average to participate in sports and school activities could also help our school to become academically sound. Making it a B average could do the opposite. Students who have C' s and D' s would feel discouraged and just give up there for dropping are school's average grades really low. We don't want this to happen, so instead of making it a B average let's make it a C average! Mr. Principal I sincerely hope you will take into consideration all that I have expressed to you.

Sincerely,

A member of your student body
