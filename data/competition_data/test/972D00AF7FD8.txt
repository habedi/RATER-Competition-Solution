How awesome would it be to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? Well, imagine touring crossing huge oceans and touring amazing places like Europe and China. Imagine taking a gondola to Venice, Italy. Or how about seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Seagoing Cowboys have the opportunity to explore these amazing places. It's not all about sightseeing though. You have to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Pretty much anyone can join too! Luke Bomberger was working at a grocery store and a bank in the normal city, then the next thing you know, hes in a different country exploring. Its a big change to go through. It feels good to help out innocent animals in need. Although the trips to and from the sea can be dangerous, its very worth it to go join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Its kind of like being a cowboy and a pirate.

It is such a wonderful expierience to do this program. Its not something you can do everyday, its like being an NBA player, you cant just say you are one. You have to work for these things, only the greatest people get the opportunity to become great. Luke Bomberger was special, so thats why he qualified for the program. Being in the Seagoing Cowboys program is amazing, who wouldnt wanna be a pirate/cowboy. And that is why you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
