Dear, School Board

I would personally like to thank you for taking the time out of your very productive day to read my letter. My name is Generic_Name I go to Generic_School in Generic_City. And i believe that students should take classes at school instead of online because. If a student needs help they can ask a teacher, cheating would increase dramatically more than it already has and there would be a increase in procrastination.

I am a student who in the classroom doesn't always catch on quick so this first point is going to be personal. If the school district decides to move classes online not only I but hundreds of other kids would struggle to keep up. And when we're doing online classes from home there is no teacher. or extra help it is soley depended on us to do the work. Students also do better with human interaction instead of a computer telling you to "repeat the question if you do not understand".

Another reason why doing school work online rather than a classroom is a bad idea is because of cheating. Cheating is already a big problem in this day of age with online resources such as: photo math, mathway. com and websites where you pay people to your work for you makes it way to easy to cheat. And cheating is bound to sky rocket when students cant get help from teachers they will resort to cheating or anything of that matter just to pass. I know for a fact if my grades were low and there was no other options i would cheat myself. But there will be no need for that if we just keep doing what we've been doing and learning the ciriculumn in a classroom with human interaction.

My final and last point is procrastination. Procrastination is something that is very common nowaday's. it is when you put something off to the very last minute. Now you're going to tell me that out of all the students in stafford county school system that not one individual is going to procrastinate. Say a student is having trouble on his or her online work and and they want to take a break for a couple hours. Well those hours could turn into days and those days into weeks all because they couldnt finish there work. We are in a age where technology is fascinating and entertaining espicially to teenagers in particular with Xbox and Playstaion and just having a phone in general that could cause procrastination. If students feel as if they are not getting there work done or they're not getting a subject they're just going to procrastinate or cheat.

In conclusion online classes would only hurt the school system and just produce bad habits. And those habits will go down the road with students in future jobs and businesses. Once again i would like to thank you for reading my letter.

Sincerely, Generic_Name
