I would like to begin telling you on my specific reasons of hating this subject, some kids need the exercise and can't get it anywhere else. It would probably raise each of the students grades considering the fact that most kids are overweight and need to lose it. Which would cause an academic change in their lives. Some kids may need help in their schoolwork but also need to fix their bodies. It is important to stay active or you can die young and not be able enough to think in class. If your son was sent to their licensed physician they would be lectured on saying that they are not staying active. Many things can happen if you don't stay healthy like lack of thinking and many other things like fatigue, nausea, weight gaining ,etc. I've learned many things over the years and its been hard but I've been working out more outside of school. Maybe you should allow all kids to workout in school no matter what their academic standards are. I think that your selfishness is bringing kids home to video games and not any sports thus making it harder for them to succeed in life. But the kids still need to get their grades up but imagine a star quarterback on a football team imagine he has no one or place to go to his life revolves around football he might get a scholarship to go to college but his grades are slipping and he has no money for a tutor, then what is he going to do. You should resign as a principal and see how it feels to have no money. You should take that into consideration. There should be a student council meeting with many of the football, basketball ,and soccer players and you should hear what they have to say according to this matter if you don't want to attend then what does that make you? I'll tell you what it makes you, it makes you a hypocritical coward considering the fact that you might have played sports when you were younger. When you used to play did you feel good playing or did you stay home. If you were poor i could see that it's hard living that way but you need to grow up and face life and grow mentally and physically. It could be the possibility of ADD . But I agree that kids still need to get their grades up but don't take away their fun. I am half Puertorican and half irish, people usually judge others by race but that's not always the case including right now so please get back to me.

Sincerely, 8th grader
