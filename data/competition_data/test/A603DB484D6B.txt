The use of the Facial Action Coding System, to read emotional expressions of students, isn't valuable. It is in fact an incredible use of technoogy and it also would be neat to see how people are feeling, but you shouldn't be able to know how people are feeling without them personally telling you themselves. What if there is something someone is trying to hide? Something that is very personal and other people shouldn't know about, but you an see how they're feeling so you insist they tell you.

The technology might not actually work. I t might jut be a scam to make people think that they're feeling certain way about something. It shoudn't be possible to just use a machine to tell how someone is feeling inside.

The Facial Action Coding System was a very clever device. You could see how someones feeling in a picture, in person, you could even see how people feel towards homework. Even though it is a very interesting use of technology, you shouldn't be able to tune into other people's emotions, even if they are your students. Which is why this use of tehnology is not valuable.
