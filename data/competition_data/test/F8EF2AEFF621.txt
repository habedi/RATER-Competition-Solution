Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm writing you this letter to let you know that I am taking a position with the students being required to perform community service after school. I feel this is necessary because i know that most students just go home and just play video games or watch television. I believe that instead of them going home after school and killing there brain cells and being lazy , that they should have to do at least six hours of community service a week. This should be considered extra credit for 25 points for there classes too . The students could participate at the Boys And Girls Club , YMCA ,LACC , or help keeping there neighborhood a clean environment. I would like to be apart of this too. I'd rather spend my evenings helping kids expand there vocabulary and knowledge then just sitting at home watching television and being on the computer. I also believe that the government should make funds to technology companies so that they can put a chip inside computers that will only allow kids to be on it 48 hours a week because if they don't have anything to do at home then they would want to at least go outside and be active. All of us could use a little excitement in our lives and could be more active. I know that it's in your knowledge to do the positive and reasonable thing. I think that this letter should be token into consideration. I hope you agree with me and talk to other schools or staff about starting this. I believe that this could play a big part in our school, our communities, and in our lives.

Thank you,

- STUDENT_NAME.
