I think students should have a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. I think this because students grades should be more important then participating in sports and activities. I also think this because this will help students keep their grades up if they do want to participate in something that the school has to offer. My last reason for agreeing with this is that if this is a possible policy change it will encourage athletic and students who participate in activities, to be concerned about their grades and keep them up.

A students grades in school should be the main concern more than them being in a sport or activity. This policy change will encourage those students to focus on their grades as well as the activity they are involved in, or would like to be involved in. Students should not have a problem with this policy change if they are that passionate to take on sports and activities. If this is changed as a new school policy the students grades will be higher and more focused on then just the sport or activity they want to be in.

This new change could help benefit students a great deal who have grades lower than a B average. It could help them in school by keeping their grades up and making them care more about their education. This could also help students with poor grades who do not try hard in class but may be passionate about a sport and will want to be on that team and will make them put forth effort and try harder in class. This could also benefit them by keeping them out of summer school or having to repeat a grade level.

Most of the students who want to participate in activities will pay more attention to their school grades and keep them up to an A or B average. The new change will help parents be more attentive of their son or daughter's grades in school. This can also help parents to be more involved in the helping of their child's study habit's.

In conclusion i believe that students should have to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports and activities. This should be a policy change for the school in order to help students with their grades.
