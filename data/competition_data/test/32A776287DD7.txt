We need to keep a better enviroment if we want to live in a more healty world. one of the best was is to limit car uasge. There are many advantages of limiting car usage for people. A coulpe of examples are the air an world would not be as polluted more then it already is,  and this could improve the satfy for other people.

By wanting to live in a more healty place we need to keep the air clean, that is one of are biggest problems with useing cars all the time. One way there are trying to accomplush this is by makeing homes an cities denser, so that its would be better for walikng or biking riding. making these homes more compact there would be molre accesibletily to public transportation. which would leave more space for better walk was . By doing this we are reducing car use an saveing the air a little at a time ,to imp[rove this world.

Another advantage woulod be that with less cars running around the streets would be way satfier. With generation being that more kids are starting to drive everyone esle is more at risk with there satfy. "different things are convering which suggest thta we are witnessing a long-term cultral shift" mean that we can still feel connected to other peolpe without driving.  So we dont need to be driving around all the time it would be in all of are best interst to limit driving cars.

in conclusion i feel that limiting driveeing would help all of us in the long run into liveing in a better an safer wold. Tat if we take care of will keep us safe by living here.
