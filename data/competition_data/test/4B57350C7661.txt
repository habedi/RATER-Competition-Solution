Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this letter to you concerning your decision on whether or not all of the students should be required to help in community service.

I believe community service is a great help to our community. Some of the students would prefer not having to be included in this activity because they would like more time doing things like play video games, watch tv, read books, or go on the internet. I believe these things are a waste of time and do not help us in any way unless used for a good reason. But others may not have the time to help because they have to be somewhere after school or they have a lot of homework they need to get done.

It all depends on when we would do community service. If it were during school hours everyone would have to participate. If it were during after school hours, everyone may be required to participate, but they would be able to leave school grounds because school has been dismissed. To conclude i think we should all be required to help in community service. I also think we should help in community service during school hours so everyone would be able to participate.

Community service is a wonderful way to help people, and help people have a better enviroment. I suggest we should clean up liter around the neighborhood, fix up our school playground by repainting old equipment, and help the elderly with things they are unable to accomplish. I hope I have been of help in your decision on whether we should be involved in community service or not.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
