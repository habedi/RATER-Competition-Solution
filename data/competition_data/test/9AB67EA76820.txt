Do you think students should have to participate in extra curricular activities? I think we shouldn't as some people may not have the time to do them or just may not want to. Some people may not like sports or just are not very good a them. Some people may not want to do anything and may just want to do homework or be with friends. There might not be enough or any options they might like. Here are some more reasons why.

The reasons why some people may not be able or want to do yearbook would be that some people may not show up to get their picture taken or they may not have the time to get to a person. Some people may not want to get their picture taken. It can be stressful sorting out whos in what grade and if they do any extracurricular activities which ones. People may get stressed over yearbook for not having enough time or things in it.

The reasons why some people may not want or be able to participate in student council would be that some people may not be able to do it they might have tight schedules and might not be able to go to the meetings after school. It can be stressful trying to figure out what to fix and helping others. Decision making might be hard as it can help some but hurt others and certain people might make bad decisions.

There are some reasons why not everyone would want to do sports to like some people might be handicapped or unfit to play sports. Some people may not like sports or may not have time after school to play them. Some people may get stressed over practices and homework. I feel like it would also just not help as some people may get bullied or laughed at for messing up.

Another problem would be that not everyone has enough time to actually do these things like some people may have family issues or need to be picked up by a certain time. Some things may take a long time and might cause problems to people who have to do homework. Some people might be sick or have to be places at a certain time.

This is why not everyone might be able to do after school activities and why I think its a bad idea.
