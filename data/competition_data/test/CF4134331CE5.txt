Phones and Driving

A major problem in today's generation is using your phone and driving. Most of the problem comes from teenagers. Yes, I do think it is bad to use your phone while driving if you don't have to. Using your phone while driving is a really bad thing, it can get others killed or even yourself. Just think twice before using your phone behind the wheel.

Most states have made it illegal to use your phone while driving because it is really dangerous. While you are operating not just an automobile but any type of machine you must have all attention on that one thing nothing else . 100 percent of your attention should be with what you're doing at all times. Using your phone in any kind of way while driving can get you pulled over and even get a large fine.

One of the main things that drivers use their phone for is texting while they drive. That is probably the worst thing you could do while driving. Just think about it, you are taking your hands and eyes off the road and looking at your phone. Not only is that dangerous for you but you have to look out for others around you. Many people have died for using their phone while driving and died because of other people using their phone while driving.

The government has came out with a law that states that no matter the age you are not allowed to use your phone or have your phone in your hand while driving a car. A car is a dangerous thing and if you aren't careful with it then some really bad things can happen to other people or even yourself. If you get pulled over for being on your phone there is a 90% chance that you will get over a hundred dollar fine. So just ask yourself, is it really that hard to just drive?

In September, 2011 there was a texting and driving case. The driver was Rachel Gannon, a 16 year old girl from kansas city that was texting and driving. While Rachel was texting and driving illegally. Rachel Gannon got into a wreck with 72 year old Loretta Larimer. Loretta Larimer was killed in the car crash and Rachel Gannon was charged with manslaughter and assault. Rachel Gannon nw faces up to four years in prison for manslaughter and assault and she also has a 200 dollar fine for texting and driving.(2012)

Is texting and driving really worth killing yourself, killing others, wrecking, or paying a large fine? They should make some kind of technology that cuts your phone off while you are driving anything. If they did that it would cut down just about half of car wrecks and car deaths. Just stay off your phone while you are driving, it really isn't worth it.
