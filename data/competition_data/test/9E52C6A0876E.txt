Dear, Mr. Principal there are many reasons why students should perform community service . To begin with, for example, today people in the United States are throwing trash around our communities and not knowing what might happen to our world as a person I also, like eating and drinking but when your done you really have to clean up your area where you have been sitting. Next, many people that i know of in our school don't care about our work place or about our outside grounds and we should make them clean the most because they are the ones that did this to our work place. On the other hand, those students that are excellent in school and responsible/respectful to their work place should do less community service because they are all experiencing the problems like I already told you for example, throwing trash in playgrounds and throwing a wrapper when no one is looking in the cafeteria and those students like me do community service hours by picking up trash or papers when they see it in the hallways and they also, are responsible for their work they do in the classroom for example, they push in chairs, they clean up their area workplace and finally, they are responsible for everything that they do. Lastly, community services hours are very important for our nation to last long in the future and be clean of garbage's and filthy areas!
