Dear Mrs. Principal,

I know this has been a difficult week for you. There are lots of people at this school and all of them have opinions. Some people think cell-phones should be allowed at lunch and break but not during class. Still others think they should be banned at school. I think the second group is right , they should be banned at school. I think this for many reasons.

The first reason is that cell-phones are commonly misused. If you tell them they can have them at lunch, they will be out during class. This will cause all sorts of problems. Give them an inch and they will take a mile. Texting during class will become a huge problem. In turn grades will go down because students are not paying attention in class and will miss important information. You can not ignore this. In summary, because students would misuse them cell phones should be banned at school.

Another reason is that talking at lunch would go down. Instead students would text. Student without phones would be left out of these conservations. These conversations would unwatched by teachers. Students could say whatever they want. Fights could be caused and happen on phones without any teachers knowing it. Inappropriate messages could be sent. All these things would cause dissention and problems among students. For this reason cell-phones should be banned at school.

Lastly cell-phones are small and easy to get lost. A student could misplace it very easily at school. There are tons of places where it could get lost in a school. It also could get stolen or hidden as a cruel joke. A missing phone would cause problems at home. Parents would be upset with no way to communicate with their kid and a expensive fee for a new phone on top of it. To save this problem cell-phones should be banned at school.

So in summary, cell phones should be banned at school. They are commonly misused, cause problems, and are easily lost. Please take this into consideration as you make your decision.
