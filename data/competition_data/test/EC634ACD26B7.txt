To get this thing started I absoulutely love being a Seagoing Cowboy! It is adventerous and a lot of the things I do can just absoulutely take my breath away sometimes. There are a lot of things I could try to persuade you with, but we don't have time for all of those. One of the reasons that everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that we get to go and travel to a lot of places. These places aren't just ordinary places, these places are amazing because, they are places that people dream to go to! For example China!

I turned 18 before I arrived at Greece. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I made nine trips which is more than any Seagoing Cowboy. I have been to many places like Greece, China, Europe, and many more. When we had free time we played baseball, volleyball, we had table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whitting, and games also helped pass our free time.

I also have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. As you can see I have done a lot while being a Seagoing Cowboy and this was all done at a young age. You have to commit to it and then you will love it! It is a great time but you also have to work hard, trust me I have learned that. I hope that after reading this I have persuaded you enough to make you want to try to be a Seagoing Cowboy.
