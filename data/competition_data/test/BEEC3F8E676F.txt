Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I, for one, disagree with this statement. i find it unfair for a student to have a grade B average. i can understand C average but a B is hard to keep for some students, once you have gone up to one, or down to one. Mostly the students have

C averages and i think that with this going on, there will be no soccer tem, or football team or basketball team, or volleyball team.

i understand that maybe an upside to this whole statement is to probably motivate students to try harder to be able to have a privilege of being on that basketball team or that football team or that volleyball team.

But sir, what you do exceed of thinking is that what if young RELATIVE_NAME had an A plus in science and he forgot to study for the chemistry test on Friday, and little did he know that exact test was worth 50% of his grade? RELATIVE_NAME failed that test, and ended up having a c in science, giving him a C grade average. RELATIVE_NAME love football and he wanted a scholar ship, but never got because he didn't go to the finals with the rest of the team, simply because he missed one particular test.

Once you down from an A to a B, you try to figure out what was wrong and you try to work on it, but what if nothing was worth as much as what you missed? what if one 50% test was equal to three more of those tests? Going up from a C to a B is exciting, but you're trying to keep up the good work. once you do, you can't get overly exited, or else you might feel a little over whelmed and get a little "big headed" and mess up on the whole thing you had going for a while.

A sport should not be handled as a privilege, it she handled as a recommendation. because kids can always go to a public team and try out there. that's just making the team here at school seem more "exclusive" which is basically pointless.

Another hypothetical question, sir; What if little RELATIVE_NAME, has okay grades, but no social skills? Isn't that what sports are all about? social skills, working together, and exercise. Those are the three magic words to get into a great high school. To Sum up my little story, children should have the free right to play on what ever team they want, whenever they want.
