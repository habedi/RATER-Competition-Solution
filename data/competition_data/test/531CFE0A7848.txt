Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle?

Do you think drivers should use their phones while operating a vehicle? Do you think it is safe to be on your phone while driving? Well in this essay I will be explaining why I don't think drivers shouldn't operate a vehicle while driving.

Many accidents occur when drivers get on the road and are distracted by their phones. A lot of people had their life taken away from them when people were driving and being on the phone. Too young adults, too adults we all have been guilty for being too addicted to our phone including me but it is a time and a place to be on your phone and not to be on your phone. As a young adult, I know and understand the risk of driving and being distracted by my phone. Many cases have been reported on the death of people who were texted and driving. I know sometimes you want to send out the text message to your friends or your loved one. I know you want to check your email to see if you got hired for the job you want. however, you shouldn't be on your phone while trying to drive. That is highly dangerous for you and the other person who is driving in the next car.

You should be focused on the road, not on your phone because it can only take one look away from the road to cause a serious car accident that can do two things death or put you in a critical injury .using your phone can cause serious damage while driving because you are trying to do two things at one time. Let me explain when you're driving you should be focusing on the road nothing else because you can't be on be focusing on two things at the same time that's is impossible. another reason is that there are some people, not all that drive crazy and that's don't pay attention to the other car they drive fast and don't care about the other people driving. So while driving you have to focus on more than one thing and I know that people probably say that"

but I have always been on my phone when I am diving all the time and I haven't been in an accident". that might be the case, however, it doesn't guarantee that it will not happen. in reality, it only takes one time for something that can change your life forever. These days there is a law for that now and police are locking up people for that or giving them a ticket. But what if you were the unfortunate ones that died because the police didn't catch you on your phone?

In conclusion, if you don't want to be in jail for killing someone because you're distracted then you can pull over to send that text, check your Instagram or your email. Your life and freedom are more important than the people on your phone. even if you don't feel like going that then have someone else in the car with you who can drive so that you can check/reply to your text message. does it have to take you to kill someone to learn the lesson?
