Dear principal,

Policy 2 is probably better because students text too much. Texting makes students dumber because they use short hand and spell things wrong during school. Students text during class and don't pay attention because they are too busy texting. I think it would be better if students leave their phones off in their locker.

Teachers want students to be better in school and become smart people, well then they have to do something about it. I think they should have policy 2 because students aren't going to do much if they're texting. The students could have their opinion and say that texting is important to them and they can't live without it well the truth is they would be better off without it. They would become smart, intelligent people because they would spell things right and they would pay attention more. All they concentrate on is their phones and nothing else.

When they call people they never want to hang up, so they focus on that and not school. If they couldn't use their phones then people would look at them different, like they were better people. Why do students think they can't live without a phone? It's because they get hooked to it like a lot of people do with a television, they can't put it down. Like me, most students are pretty much addicted to electronics. They think it's all they can get use out of in life. Most kids, if they are not addicted to the computer, then they are hooked to their phone. Some kids rely on their phone too much and cannot put it down. So policy 2 is probably better.

Sincerely,
