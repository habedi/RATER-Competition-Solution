hat if we lived in a world with no cars? What are cars really? According to source 4 "A car is just a means from getting from point A to point B when BART doesn't work." If this is true then a cars only purpose is to polloute and cause trafic jams and accidents. If more people took the bus or walked or rode their bike to work we would see a steady decrese of greenhouse gasses. Also the less cars on the rode the fewer traffic accidents there would be.

F

irst of all, We all live on the same planet its up to us to take care of it. Source 1 states "Passenger cars are responisible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States." This quote states that cars are one of the main reasons for pollotion in the world. Therefore, without cars polloting the streets the world would not only be a better to live in but a cleaner one as well.

N

ext, without cars in the streets there would be less trafic accidents. This is clear in source 3 when it shows"Clombians hiked,biked,skated or took busses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this cappital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." What this quote is showing is that cars only cause unessacary problems for everybody. Plus the less cars on the streets the fewer recless drivers there would be as a result there would be fewer car accidents.

I n conclusion, the limit on car usage can only be possitive. With fewer cars being sold the levels of greenhouse gasses would decrese. But not only that, less cars mean less accidents. Cars only cause problem in the world, whats being 10 minutes late compared to the safty of your fellow man. Source 4 states Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, propsed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cites in which  "pedestrian,bicycle,private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissins and improve safty."
