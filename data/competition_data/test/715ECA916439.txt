Dear Principal,

I believe that community service should be purely voluntary. People may be too busy to take part in service, so it may be excusable. Though to get more volunteers, there may be an incentive formed to help them think of performing acts for the community. It may be more productive requiring the service, but what of those that still disagree with doing it? If it were required we would have much more punishment than what is necessary. That being said our society is growing less responsible, so those that take community responsibility on their own may only need to feel the pride of helping others. In my honest opinion it seems to me that if everyone were doing service, there may not be anything available for everyone to do. Organizing the services may also be too much of a hassle than it is worth, and above that how would we know if the people are really doing their duties? It seems to be psychological if the person would do service or not, and I think that it should be their decision to make things fair. It doesn't seem right morally to force people into service, even for their community.

Sincerely, a student.
