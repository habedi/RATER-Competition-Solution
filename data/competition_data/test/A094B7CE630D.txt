In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This piece of technology allows us to read the emotional expressions of our peers and well, paintings, such as Da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. From this, it has been discovered that Mona Lisa was eighty-three percent happy, six percent fearful, nine percent disgusted, and two percent angry. I believe that the information recieved from the Facial Action Coding System is valuable.

In today's world, we rely so much on technology that it's hard to see a world without it. We all use technology everyday whether it be a computer, cellphone, or even a television. With advancements and improvements in technology, that leads us to believe that the accuracy of technology is reliable. In the article, the author talks about the software. The emotion-recognition software can track anything from a real face to a painting, and tell whether or not the person is angry, sad, mad, or happy. Humans use this same technique everyday. In the article, the text states "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." Well that's just what the Facial Action Coding System does. Facial expressions are universal. Based on the article, we can tell that technology is more fast and efficient working than ever. Technology is like our brains, it processes things quickly and with accuracy.

Most of the time the human eye can tell how someone is feeling, but we are not always certain because it is difficult for us to desribe facial features. There's no need for that when upcoming technology can do it for you. In the text, it tells us that artists study human anatomy for precision when painting the face. The software Dr. Huang uses detects the small things such as the slight curve of a lip or even the squint of an eye to determine emotions. The Mona Lisa shows us just that. An example from the text is "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar might follow." This is because even our computers can detect our emotions and follow it with an ad similar to how we are feeling.

From the article, the reader can even try the expressions for themselves to test the accuracy. I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. If the student is stressed or mad but not willing to confront a teacher about how they are feeling, the teacher can know based on the technology or even looking for the small things such as a curve of the lip. This may take stress off of students as well as adults.
