In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to idenify human emotions. Yes I agree that the use of this technology to read the emotinal expressions of people and students because some people are scared to show they fears and even things that borther them.

In the Text "Making Mona Lisa Smile"

I notied alot of vaulid points and and good reasoning behind the idea of the Human Emotion things I feel as if it would slove promblems around and help people thats suffuring from addiciton, depression "happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness" and other things that they are going threw . It will help out wsith people that dont like speaking up or that is swcared of what other people will think or say about them if they ask for help or even reach out for help. And ill support my answer with "A Classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". and " Most human communcation is nonverbal, including emotional communcation."

My conculsion for the text is that they should not only be in school it should be in hospitals , schools, and places that deal with clients of common emotion problem or even health .
