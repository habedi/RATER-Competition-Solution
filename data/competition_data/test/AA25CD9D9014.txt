Dear Principal,

I really think it would be right to do community service because it would look really good on our school application for college. Even thought we wouldn't like doing this community service, it would look really good on a college application. This service could be for soup kitchens, catholic charities, and other things that people would need help with. People around the world may think this is stupid but it can make a difference.

This school would be a great place if everyone would do this once a month. When people from different high schools see that we have helped people, they would like us to go to their school. People may say that's a big responsibility but it can help a lot of people. Whether these people are different, it doesn't matter it can make a difference.

This school has helped people like this. We have helped the catholic charities, pennies for peace, and the OTHER_NAME Center. We have raised many of things to these charities. When we were in sixth grade we have helped the OTHER_NAME

Center and we gave them toothbrushes, hair products, and many other things that have helped them/ The were very blessed to have a school like this to donate them these items.

Pennies for peace was to support the people in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We provided pennies for their schools, each penne cost at least one pencil. We have donated $48 dollars to these school that need supplies. That is about four-hundred pencils for these kids!

In seventh grade, we did catholic charities, this is a place where the homeless could get food when they didn't have money to get their own. A few of my friends and I would go to this facility and help these homeless get their food. Two people would bag the groceries, two people would get the different breads if needed, and the other two would get them toiletries bags if needed. We have helped over fifty people! They were also blessed to have kids like us.

As you can see we have helped different people a lot. You can make a difference also by trying to help people, like me, and make a difference. These people were happy to have a great school like us. If i were you i would help people do community service. Its not stupid its a great opportunity. Go make a difference and help the world.
