Have you ever been forced to do something that you did not want to do? Like a sport or some type of activity? Well the principal has decided that now on you have to be taking an extracurricular activity and I think that idea is terrible and disagree with his decision and here are my three main reasons. First what if the students parents can not help there kid with anything involving the activity. Secondly, the students may not have enough time for the activity. Thirdly, students may not like any of the activities.

First lets talk about how parents can't get involved/or help with the activity at all. Like what if the activity fee is to much and the students parents can not afford it. Or there parents could be working later than usual and there not able to pick you up from the activity because there to busy with work. Also what if your parents are at home watching other siblings how are they gonna drop/pick you up. Or even what if they stayed home sick and there not feeling good who's going to pick them up or drop them off. And what if there exhausted from a big day of work and don't feel likeÂ getting up or moving because there to tired. Finally what if there injured and can't get out of bed then who's gonna pick or drop of the kids because they obviously can't.

Next lets talk about students not having enough time for the activity because they have stuff to do. Like they have a lot of HW they have to do or catch up on. Or there going to another siblings activity because they can't stay home alone. Also they may have to stay home and watch younger siblings because they can't be left home alone without someone. Or even what if they planned with a couple of friends to hangout that day and go do something fun. And what if there parents have a lot of chores planned for them and there not able to finish because they have to go to the activity. Finally what if they do other activities outside of school like a sport or a club.

Finally lets talk about how the students may not like any of the activities the school has and what it could cause. Like the students could get mad that there being forced to do something they do not wanna do. Or they could develop a bad relationship with there parents because they feel like there parents are forcing them to do it. Also they might get so bored they will just end up skipping the activity instead of going to it. Or even there behavior could change in a bad way making them mean, naughty, and disrespectful. And they could start developing depression because there being forced to do something they do not want to do which can build up depression/anger/sadness. Finally they could get really bored of the activity and keep misbehaving.

This is why forcing kids to do something they don't want to do/or can't do is bad. Because it can lead up to a lot of bad things in a students life and a very few good things. So I think these activities should be optional so you do not have to deal with your parents not being able to help you with anything involving the activity, or not having enough time to do the activity, and not having any activities you like. So if they were optional it would create not as much stress on the students and parents so not everyone is freaking out.
