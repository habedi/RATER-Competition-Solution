dear principal,

Students should be required to perform community service because its helps them realize what the real world is like. Also because some kids just think about themselves so if they go out and help someone less fortunate as them then they will take a whole new look on the world.

To begin with if kids do community service it will help them realize what the world is really like. For example last year I had no plan to get a job or go to college because i had no sense of what the real world is like. but then i was involved in a little program that our school does called kids in the community and we went and did all kinds of community service, but the one memory that sticks in my mind is when we went to the soup kitchen. I was talking to some of the people in there and there plans as a little kid were just like mine.

It made me realize that I don't want end up like them without a home, family, and friends I want to live in a great big home and have a great big family.

secondly it will give the students a whole new look on the world. i know that my experience will never leave me and i will never go back to my old ways of thinking. I remember that in the seventh grade all I thought about was myself, but now all i think about is helping others and seeing what I could do for my teachers.

to sum this whole letter up i know that you will make the right decision and require the students to do at least a few hours of community service because it changed my life and i know it will change the life of a few others.
