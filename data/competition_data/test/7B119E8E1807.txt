In my opoion I think it would be kind of cool if a computer were to read students facial expressions. If a computer were to actually do this, it would be to detect how a person is feeling and that would make everyone else curious of how the computer can real people's emotion and make them want to see hoow it works.

This would be very valuable to many students because it can detect how their feeling and if they're feeling down they can maybe talk to a teacher about it, or may just want to be left alone. This computer may also put people on the spot as to how their feeling, and may not to express themselves. This piece of technology might make people feel desprite of need to talk to someone anbout why they are feeling the way they are feeling.

There are limits to how far this technology can go to reading someone's facial expressions and emotion because there are some people that don't want a computer to read how there feeling out loud to anyone but there self.

But I also think that this kind of technology could not be useful because it would make people feel like they are being put on the spot for feeling a certain kind of way instead od feeling a way everyone wants them to feel. It would put almost everyone at risk because they might just want to be left alone and not want a computer to know how they are feeling.

This kind of technology would be useful in some ways, but that also depends on how you present this kind of technology to people and how you deminstrate this to poeple who don't have any idea on what this is used for or how it would be helpful to everyone else if a computer were read out loud how you are feeling.

So yes it would be helpful in a way and in a another way it wouldn't be.
