Dear Principal,

I think its unfair that students need at least a "B" to participate in any after school activities such as sports or clubs. Students spend more than seven hours a day at school. Sometimes it can be very stressful. With homework or test or even having to wake up so early in the morning. This is why i believe students should have the ability to relax after school and do fun things with their friends. I'm sure you can suggest other possible ideas for not having after school sports or activities. For example, suggest tutors, parent help or even teacher help. The teachers will best understand the assignments or topic and maybe the student doesn't understand. There are other ways for dealing with it. Sports and activities are very popular and a big thing in a kids life. Plus they need physical exercise to stay fit and you should not take that away. I know having a "C" isn't great but give them time to catch up and get a "B" or better an "A". Also, there needs to be something wrong with how things our being tough if most students have C' s This is your fault for not teaching them right or good enough. The students need to understand things in order to learn and get good grades.

But, have a new policy. Which is help the students learn better. Possibly make a club where students can come do there homework and get help when they don't understand something. School is a place to learn but also to have fun. Teach things more understandable so that we can enjoy the fun thing like sports and clubs. Sports can be a huge part in a persons life. It can make you a professional athlete or a young actress, by participating in basketball or drama club. If things are going on at home for a student like family issues they may not want to be at home with all the fighting, they would want to be at school, having fun with their friends. If you took away these privileges you'll just start more of a fight with the parents and students. Maybe it might even make students grades worse, because of all the stress and school and not being able to let it out by doing sports, clubs and activities. Also think of the coaches point of view. It is their job to teach them, but how can they when you wont let them. This is obviously something they love doing and know they get to teach it to other young students. What if you were a kid at this school? What if you had these activities taken away from you? How would this affect you? This is why I strongly believe the policy should not change and stay the same.

Sincerely, Student
