Dear Principal,

I've heard that you're reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I've also heard that you have two possible options, one being that you allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times if they have the phones turned off during class. Two being that the students don't bring them at all. In my opinion option one is a better choice.

I know you're probably thinking that option two is better but the kids are just going to bring their phones anyway. They would also still use their phones when the teacher walks out of the room. If you let them use them during lunch and free time then they might respect that instead of not being aloud to have their phones at all. They might even start working harder because they'll have something to look forward to when they go to lunch.

Some bad things about option one might be that the kids get distracted because thy have their phone in their pocket. They might also be tempted to turn on their phone and text somebody. Also they could already have their phone on and get a text from their friend. They could even get hyped up because they're excited about having phones in school.

Those are just some of the reasons why I like option one better. Well when you read this I hope you take this into consideration. Maybe you'll agree with what I've said. Well Have a nice day, sincearly,
