Students should have the right whether or not to do community service. In my opinion i feel that doing community service is a good way to help out your community. Doing community service allows students to be involve in what happens in the world and in there community also. Community service helps you do good things for your community, stay active, and helps earn credit for doing community service.

First, community service is a good way to help out your community. Its good because your helping your community out by picking up trash that just lays around outside or even helping out on events that take place in your community. Many citizens would appreciate that you are taking action and being responsible in helping your community. Volunteering at events is good for your community cause it allows you to interact with different people and its a good cause.

Next, doing community service helps you stay active by moving around and doing something. Many students just sit home and do nothing, while do that when you can be outside doing something good for your community and environment. Stay active is a very good way to be healthy and you can do that by doing community service help out. You can also do community service with your friends too!! Having fun with your friends while doing community service is also a good way to stay active, you can help clean or have a community dance class, something that is fun and active.

Many people may disagree with me and say that community service is boring and picking up trash is gross but, you can have fun doing community service. Staying fit and active, helping out others with needs and much more. Helping out the community is a opportunity to help out your environment and help others too. Picking up trash isn't the best but you can have a game with it like, whoever picks up the most trash wins like 10 bucks or something fun.

Helping out the community is a good way to help the environment and other needs. Community service is a good thing and more students should be involve with it. Whether its just by helping an elder walk across the street or maybe just picking up a piece of trash on the sidewalk. Start by helping out with the community and you can start today!!
