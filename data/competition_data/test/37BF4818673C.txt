Would distance learning benefit students? Distance learning is for a chance for students to be able to attend classes from home. I believe that it would not be a good choice for students to have this opportunity for several reasons. For example, many kids would most likely stop attending school, they would procrastinate, and they would be taking disadvantage.

Distance learning sounds like a good choice for kids whom are home schooled. Students attending school this sounds like a not so good choice. The main reason being that kids would like this better because they would be staying home in bed and comfy clothes all day instead of attending school. When the kids grow up they will have jobs and most of the time they will not be able to have a shot at something like this. We need to show kids how to be responsible and ready to take on a task.

Secondly, I feel like the student would be taking disadvantage of a opportunity other kids might not have. Several kids wish that they could sit in a classroom with other kids and a teacher to ask questions. Not saying that kids over computer wouldnt ask questions but it would be different in way that teachers could not possible physically explain to them. The ability to be able walk into a school and be able to sit down one on one with your teacher is a bonus, something that we should continue to provide for the students.

Lastly, Students would be less involved and would not get opportunities to do hands on projects. Yes, they would be able to ask questions, take tests, or even be involved with the class a little but they would miss out on getting to work with other students and presenting. The students would also have less time to meet new people. This would also be a disadvantage for teachers, if a teacher is in the middle of teaching the class and the student participating in distance learning has a question they will then try and communicate with the teacher and it would just be a huge distraction for the class.

In conclusion, young teenagers everything is online. Us giving this opportunity to students would be us saying its okay to spend all their day on their electronics. This could be would not be affordable to some families who could not afford a computer, camera, and microphone. These are they reasons why I do not stand on the side of distance learning. In my mind I believe that it would not benefit the students.
