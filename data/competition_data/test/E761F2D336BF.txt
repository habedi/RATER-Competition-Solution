The challenge of pursuiting and exploring Venus presents dangers lets start off by saying. Sulfruic acid in Venus's atmosphere tempetures are average of 800 degrees fahrenheit atomspheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we have on our own planet. Conditions are exterme to encounter what we have on our Earth this enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to dividing to the deepest parts of our ocean and would liquifey many metals. Beyond huge pressure the plant weather is beyond, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequently lightning strikes. To probes seeking land itsurface is much more dangerous for the a worthy pursuit depite the other dangers going on there on venus. Although Venusa had large oceans and could have upported various of forms of life. Venous also has some feature that are dangerous to those on earth. this is a crucial condisdersation.

Although scientist have created a " float fray" that is a blimp-like figure that can hover over 30 or so miles above Venusian's landscape the storms are still likely to hit. It is not a easy condition to send humans and have them survive. This hovering expirence is less effective more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from that distance. Despite their risks or maybe even challenges having to face. Venus has lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

In conclusion, makinig more mechanical parts be made resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces could still be even better. But also there is always a risk to something. Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus had value all because humans have a curiosity that will likely be gaining on the planet itself, our challenges should not be limited by dangers and doubts. We should be on the very edge and have imagination and creativity. These are the dangers of the study that Venus presents and a worthy pursuit depite danger it is a risky attempt for NASA and scientist.
