Dear Principal,

I want to talk to you about my opinion of students having cell phones at school. I really think that both of the policies have a lot of benefits, but yet can have consequences to it. It really is debate. This really depends on how student take this privilege, because some students use their phones at school even though they are not allowed to either ways.

Well, first of I all agree with both of the ideas, the good thing about having cell phones during school periods is that some kids have family emergencies and must have their phones on during school. Hey, teachers can have their phones during class and they don't have consequences. Like adults we can have a family members really sick too. come on we are humans, maybe we forgot our gym clothes in the car or at home, if we have a phone to contact our parents with and we don't use it then why do we have phones at all? A lot of members in our school have to walk home after school or after a practice, if something is wrong or something happens to us them we have our phone too call 911,some parents think that if school doesn't let phones being used in school then we shouldn't take them at all, because we are not going to use them.

But now on the other side of the story... Cell phones being used all day during school is very bad, for both teachers and students. Seriously! I have seen my friends text without even looking at the keyboard! It's scary! What I am trying to say is that teens will not focus on their class and work, they will not pay attention at all. We are the future and we must learn to make a difference. In a teens life right now the most important material thing in the world, are cell phones! Some students have very nice phones! While other people don't even have one. Students are able to steal, students distract themselves all the time and when their phones get stolen, the school is the one that gets blamed. not the student because they don't know which student out of the whole school did it.

I really don't know which side to go with, both of them have their pros and cons. Most of them have serious effects. Others just don't. So I'll leave it up to you. After all your the principal, adult and you have other perspectives as I do. You will make the right decision. Leave you to it. Later.

Sincerely,

Another student that admires you!
