I personaly think this new technology that is able to detect people's emotions is valuable. It can calculate emotions by a 3-D computer model of a face. It has so many emotions that it can detect. It can detect your emotion even if you're hiding it. A computer can detect when you're changing your emotion to another. An comuter works like any math homework. You can write things down.

When you write some instructions down it can "encode" different emotions. It can come in handy if you're wondering what someone emotion are even though you can call someone on your cellphone on facetime and you can see and talk to them at the same time. This new technology is like a new generation of things to get better and easier. This new thing lets people know how you're feeling even though they cannot see you and they didn't tell you. It's amazed people of how new and different it is.

You can thank Dr. Huang and his college experts for coming up with this new idea. Also Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS. He had classified six basic emotions which are - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Which he also associated each with characteristic movements of the facial expression/ muscle. Dr. Huang put up a video using imagery.
