POV (Point Of View): Talking to a group of students in hopes of convincing them to join extracurricular activities and giving them a little bit of insight on the benefits of them.

It's a common and widely spread opinion to think that school is dreadful. Some students wake upÂ with no other goal than trying to get through their day as quickly as possible. It is true that the concept of school itself can be very over-whelming, especially when everyday feels like a repeat of yesterday. I believe that there are a few ways to make students look forward to going to school, and that is extracurricular activities. Even if you don't want to participate simply because you don't want to involve yourself at all in anything school related, it's still important that you do a minimum of one extracurricular activities. If you think about it, all students, like yourselves, are required to attend school everyday regardless, so why not try making your own personal stay a little more enjoyable?

There's a variety of activities to choose from. If some students are not the sporty type, there are plenty of non physically-active activities still available. These activities are usually non-school related unless you choose it to be. Not only are you given the opportunity to choose what activity you think suits you best, but these activities give you time to yourself everyday to distract your brain from obtaining knowledge constantly and instead putting your mind at ease for a while whilst still being somewhat productive. Some of these activities may already be ones that you do normally as hobbies such as drawing, acting, playing an instrument and/or sport.

Depending on what activity you choose, you may get the chance to improve your skills in things you may be struggling in such as Math, writing, English, etc. If you're lucky, you may find an activity that will inspire and guide any passions you have. The great thing about being able to choose what you want to sign up for as an extracurricular activity is that chances are, you'll most likely be able to find something you're interested in or perhaps find out about talents/skills you weren't aware you ever had! Some of the singers and/or actresses/actors that you see today are only here because their talents were discovered as little children in places such as schools. Maybe participating in one activity will help you unlock a new passion for something as well.

Many schools offer clubs or activities that some may find boring or useless but still significant for your knowledge. Clubs such as Self Defense Club is one that will teach you the manners and logistics on how to defend and protect yourself in certain situations. There have even been times where knowing these life-saving tips have spared someones life. You never know what people are capable of, especially being surrounded with many people you don't know personally in school. One of the most important benefits of signing up for an activity is friendship. If you sign up, everyone else will want to too and that increases the probability of you meeting someone who's interested in the same hobbies as you. Numerous activities available for sign-up in schools are beneficial and fun and could help you shape your future, so thinking twice would be a wise decision!

It's safe to say that extracurricular activities aren't hurting anyone. If anything, they bring people together and help you familiarize yourself with what catches your eye and what doesn't. If you're someone that's scared to exit your comfort zone just remember; Comfort zones are your quota, they are a comfortable and familiar place, but nothing ever grows there.
