I think that driverless cars have the potential to be significantly safer to use than manually driven cars. Many people get sucked in to their phones when they should be watching the road, don't feel comfortable in control of a car, or are just bad drivers. Driverless cars can lift the responsibility of all the passengers' safety off of the driver's shoulders. They can save thousands of lives.

Google's driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Even though theirs require partial manual control, this is a good sign of the safety of driverless cars. Yes, people may still need to learn how to drive, but they would need to drive less with one of these cars. The less a person drives, the less chances there are of an accident on their part.

Sensors on cars have been around since the 1980s, and have become advanced enough to detect and respond to dangers such as out-of-control skids or rollovers. They can make the car apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. This is much more control than a human driver could manage alone. Driverless cars have the capacity to possess many more safety features than manually driven cars.

Since a driverless car would not be controlled by a person, it would not make the same mistakes on the road that a person would make. Even a partially automatic car could activate safety features to stop itself from going out of control. Driverless cars have proven themselves safe so far, and are likely to be even more safe in the future. That is why I think we need driverless cars.
