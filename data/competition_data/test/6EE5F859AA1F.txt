Venus does share similarities with earth,being like "earth's twin". Venus shares many similiarities with other than density and size,some often call it "earth's twin" because of their similarities. But unlike earth, which has an atmosphere is mostly oxygen,little carbon dioxide and also very little nitrogen,Venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide. Venus can be considered more extreme than our own world. Other than atmosphere differences,earth and venus also have differences in atmospheric pressure and in temperature average. Earth's temperature average barely even makes it into the 100's,Venus on the other hand, has a temperature average 8 times more than what we get on earth. Up to 800 degrees,which would be close to the melting point of metal. Earth's atmospheric pressure burns up anything during entry into the atmosphere. But Venus' atmospheric pressure would be 90 times of what our atmospheric pressure would be. Venus also sets the record for having the hottest surface temperature on any planet in the solar system. The reason for Venus having the hottest surface temperature would be, because it is the 2nd planet closest to sun. If scientists are planning on making an approach to study venus. But all attempts have failed, as far back as the 1940's,during world war 2. I think the author supported his idea very well.
