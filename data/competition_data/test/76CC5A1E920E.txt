Dear principle,

In my opinion i don't think it would be a good idea to require students to do community service. It is still a helpful and productive choice for students to be doing for their community, but they should be able to make their own choice on whether they should or shouldn't help out in their community.

If a student was forced to do it than it may interfere with other after school activities such as sports, homework, or even talking to your peers. It would be a lot better if students had the choice to do community service because they will most likely not have the time and/or effort to do so. Students that would do it by force may not have the motivation to do it, or as much as one that does at by choice.

I agree that it is nice to help out in the community every once and awhile but i still don't recommend that you make it a requirement because it will anger students such as myself. It will affect your students view of you, most likely in a negative way, and they may think that you're trying to waste their time.

Myself personally would not like to do it because it would make things more stressful, not only at home but in the classroom because i would worry if i was able to manage to finish my homework and my community service in a certain time span. It may also interfere with my activities that i do after school such as my sports or doing my homework. It could even possibly effect my grades if there is to much to deal with at one time.

In the end i do not agree with idea even though others may think otherwise. But it may be to much to handle at one time if we are not ready for it, many students would also not put forth the effort that they should, and you may also be disliked by the students. So please do not make community service a requirement for the school.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
