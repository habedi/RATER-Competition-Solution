This technology of reading into students emotional expressions for the classroom can be beneficial because it gives a more in depth look into how a student is feeling during a specific lesson rather than them saying they understand the lesson when they do not. This new technology may make it easier for classrooms because some kids dont like to speak up when they dont understand something and that does not help the student or teacher. So this new technology will keep the teacher up to date on how there students or feeling about the lessons.

Some students assume it is easier to just not say anything at all when they dont understand something. Students dont want to be a hassle for the teachers to have to go back and go over a lesson so they end up not saying anyhting on there confusion. Also students just do not want to be the only classmate to speak up. Dr. Huang says " A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This can help the teacher in order to realize what they can do to make the lesson more fun like helping the students engage more. Also this can just help the teacher know what they can go over in order to make the students understand certain lessons more.

This technology can help more so with the teacher because it is there job to help students when they do not understand something and to make the classroom learning process easier. Dr. Huang predicts that "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This would really help teachers alot in the sense that they dont have to worry about if anybody is behind in there class because everyone will be at there own pace on different levels of the lesson.

Using technology to read students emotional expressions during class will be very beneficial to the teacher and students. This will help the classroom flow smoother because the teacher will not have to worry about who is caught up and there understanding, if the computer can figure out where the student starts getting confused or bored. Then mabey eventually the computer will be able to modify the lesson for peoples learning pace and understandment.
