The idea of new technology that can read your facial expressions to know how you're feeling sounds incredible. Who knew that technology could get this advanced. The idea of this technology does not bother me if it were to be used in classrooms. The computer could not just be used in school classrooms but can also be used for crime solving when the detective is trying to interogate a suspect or the actual crime commiter.

This computer can be used very effectively with friends or family. If you can suspect something is wrong with someone and you want to help them you can use this technology in order to help them or comfort them. If your friend or sibling acts like they are fine but when you use the computer and you realize they are sad or mad you can help them with their problems. A big problem in the world right now are students who are sad or depressed and dont open up to people and then they tend to be alone. This technology can help those who are in need and then counseling or just friends and family come into the picture to help those who are alone.

The computer was programmed to detect the little thigs that describe how our facial expressions would be like for every emotion. Expert say that the muscles around our face tend to move differently for each of our expressions but its hard to tell if you arent an expert because we tend to be decieved. Someone could be completely depressed but when in person they are the happiest person to you and are so possitive.

This technology only seems to have a possitive future is its already invented. Maybe sometimes it will calculate a persons a emotions sometimes but that can always be fixed by the manufacturers. Later on this could be used on phones to maybe but the camera of the phones will need to be changed in order to detect perfect muscles in your face. Other than that this would most definitely be smart to put in student classrooms to be tested out by many people.
