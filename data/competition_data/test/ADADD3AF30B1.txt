Dear; Principal

I am aware of the changes you would like to make but on my point of view i think it will be unfair because some kids try there best to get a B or A but it's pretty difficult. Sometimes the students try and try but they steal get a C

and its just because there test scores, not on how they do there work or on there behavior.

I think that you should let the kids with a C average work there self's up till they get a B or A

i steal think the kids with a C are not so bad so let them participate.

What i think would be fair is if you wouldn't let the kids with a D or F average participate on sports or other activities. I think kids with a average of

D or F show that they have a poor average & they don't want to participate.

This is what i think the possible policy should be like & what i think of your possible policy.
