Dear principal,

I hear that you are deciding whether or not to make community service required in our school. I don't think that you should do this and I have many reasons why.

My first reason is that doing community service is supposed to make you feel good and make you feel like your doing something really nice out of the goodness of your heart. However, by making students do community service you are going to take that feeling away. They will be forced to do it and will not feel accomplished. They will feel like its a chore. When they grow up and they aren't required to do community service anymore they probably won't. As where a student who is not forced to do community service will probably grow up not thinking of it as a chore. They probably have a better chance of doing community service when they grow up too.

My second reason is that when children are forced to do something they don't do it as well as they could've. They will act spoiled and will not even bother to help in the community service. They will treat it like a chore and not even care about what there doing or how there doing it. They will cause a problem and may hurt someone. You have to want it and if you don't than your not going to work hard for it.

My third and final reason as to why I think you shouldn't make us all do community service is simply because me and my fellow classmates need to figure this stuff out on our own. Just as you and your family did.

We need to learn that life isn't all about us. We need to learn that we can't be selfish, and we have to think of other less fortunate people who can't afford anything we have and that we have to help them. Or we have to clean up the town a little. You have to let us figure this out on our own. Just as everybody else did. It will help us in the end.

These are all of the reasons why I strongly believe that you should not require us to do community service. I thank you for taking the time to read this message and hope that you will make a good decision.

Sincerely,

A fellow student
