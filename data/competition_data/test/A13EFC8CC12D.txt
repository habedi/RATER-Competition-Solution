Students should at least do one type of extracurricular activity because it will help them learn new things about their selfs, entertain them, and make new friends.

Doing an extracurricular activity can help the students learn new things about their self. For an example I have always thought basketball was a boring and pointless sport but when I saw others playing in this sport I ended up giving it a chance and started playing this sport. I eventually started to like this sport but it took some time getting use to, now it's the only thing I can think about all day. If the students learn new things about their self they will become more comfortable with themselves and whenever someone asks a question about what they like or whats their favorite sport they dont have to go "Uhm, I am not really sure I dont know what I really like".

Another reason students should do an acitivity is because they need to be entertained. Most students get really bored and have nothing to do in their extra time and when students have extra time they just sit around and complain how that there is nothing to do but if a student does a extracurricular activity they will engage in much more activites and not be as bored than before.

Another good reason for students to do an extracurricular activity is so they can make new friends, some students find it hard to make friends and find it hard to social with others; but if the students join a activity they will get use to being with others and be social more with others and the students will be out of their shell and will be their selfs around others.
