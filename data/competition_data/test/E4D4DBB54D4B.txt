Dear principal,

I greatly agree with having students have a grade B average.

I agree with this because the students who try to achieve a high GPA aren't necessarily rewarded.

It is almost like if you have a high GPA you can't practice your sport that you participate in.

On top of that, students don't strive for that high GPA that gets the students into college.

To top it all off increasing the GPA to participate in sports can help raise the school's grade average.

To begin with, the students who has a 4.0 GPA are awarded with not making a sporting team because the student with a 2.0 GPA makes the team.

This is not right because the student with the 4.0 GPA is home studying while the person with the 2.0 GPA is hitting a baseball instead of hitting the books.

Students don't realize that school comes first instead of sporting activities.

In addition, students who are depending on that sporting activity to make it to college don't always receive the scholarship that they have been looking at for ages.

Some students blow off school and just practice their sport and don't receive the scholarship that they wanted and they are stuck with a 2.0 GPA.

For example, one of my friends shattered their knee and he never focused on school because he thought that he would have a scholarship.

He is now stuck with a 2.0 GPA trying to find a collage that will accept him. With the new rule if they don't get the scholarship they would then have a 3.0 GPA when looking for collages.

Finally, if you were to raise the GPA to a B average you could help raise the school's grade average because all of the athletes would be striving to have a high average to participate in sporting events.

One of the reasons SCHOOL_NAME didn't have an A average is because the athletes were focusing on the state championship instead of the books.

The guidance counselor at SCHOOL_NAME said that if they had raised the GPA to compete in team sports she would have done it in a heart beat.

All in all, I highly agree with the thought that students need to make a grade B average to participate in sporting events at school.

With this new rule the people who strive for a high GPA can be rewarded.

Also, the athletes who are hoping to get a scholarship and don't quite get the scholarship will be okay in the long run.

Finally the school's GPA can become higher because, the athletes will be striving for a higher GPA.

Sincerely,

Your Student
