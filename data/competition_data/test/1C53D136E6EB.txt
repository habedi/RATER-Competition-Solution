SMASH! you're sitting in your room listening to your teacher lecture when you hear the loud noise. You wounder if you should go check it out, knowing you have a pretty clumsy family right outside, and two little brothers who would barge right in and refuse to get out. At the same time your phone won't stop buzzing because: you want to keep up with the Kardashians and because your best friend Generic_Name won't stop begging you to go to a K popÂ concert with her. You start to think if going for online school was the best choice for you. Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because of distractions like social media, and their surroundings; although, many might say it really helps them financially, our brain's function our body and at this point staying on task is something it could care less about.

Your teacher is still chatting on about the importance of being focused, as you try to multitask and text Generic_Name you will meet her at 3pm while "listening" to your teacher. I feel like our generation has become inseparable from these devices, and since they are in their room by themselves, there is no teacher to tell them "turn it off or I will give it to security", no one there to help them focus. Teachers don't only teach, they also help motivate the student to learn and stay on task. My household isn't as noisy, but my mind still wonders around to things that I would normally consider irrelevant, and I would end up realizing that I didn't comprehend what I just read.

The hard, uncomfortable, wooden chair starts to cause pain in your lower back, you spot your bed, looking for a solution for your miserable pain. You grab your laptop and climb right into your soft, memory foamed mattress and continue your lesson. You spot your walk-in closet after listening to an hour of the lecture (really like 5 min.), you remember the days when you and Generic_Name used to play dress up every time she came over. It makes you want to film a short TikToc video and send it to Generic_Name to also remind her. The grumbling of your stomach can't be ignored any longer, so you jump up and run to the kitchen and grab a few snacks and even make a sandwich, and run back to your room before your family can ask you any questions. The surroundings of a student could also distract them from focusing on their lecture. your brain knows you are in your house and are capable of eating when your hungry so it will urge your stomach to grumble more and more until it gets what it wants. When i'm in my room I would think of how much I would want to repaint the walls of my bedroom because these tan walls have been here for way too long.

However, Many students may claim that online schooling helps them financially because they can't afford the transportation there and back, they also can't afford to stay in a dorm. Many Young adults work so they can save some extra money for college debts in the future. Online flexible school hours also really helps them out because they can work and still attend school. But, do the students at home really listen to and comprehend what the teacher says through the screen? distractions like social media and their surroundings can throw them off guard in a split second. this is why I think online schooling isn't beneficial for students.
