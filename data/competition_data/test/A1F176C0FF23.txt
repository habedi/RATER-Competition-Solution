Online classrooms through video conferencing will not help students. Only truly dedicated students will actually use this and learn from this and even then they are missing out on the social experience that comes from other students and teachers, when learning at a physical school.

The people who will use this and succeed properly are a very minuscule amount. Kids who are taking solely online courses will not pay very much attention to there instructor, and they will find easy ways to cheat on exams and tests; they can look things up on the internet with there computer or phone, or have there notes sitting right there while taken the tests. Only a very small amount of people will actually learn and retain what they have learned by means of online classes especially at the middle school and high school levels.

If kids are taking solely online courses they will miss out on so many things they could experience by going to a regular school. They will miss the human connection between the teacher and student, and student to student connections and interactions. They will miss the opportunity to make mistakes and being able to learn and prepare for them better. Home school kids tend to be more introverted and not very good with interacting with people. Going to a physical school and having day to day human interactions helps you just as much if not more for the real world as does learning a subject. If we change to online classes kids in the future will not be well prepared to deal with problems regarding two or more people they may be working with. Online schooling will turn us into introverted machines, rather then regular human beings that have the chance learn, grow and interact with others.

Someone may say you can prevent cheating on tests and quizzes by having a camera on while taking them. I would say to that, no one likes having big brother watching them do things constantly let alone taking an important test without having every action you do read to determine if you're cheating or not. They may say that it gives kids more time in the day to things and takes stress off of them. I would agree but then again, you need to be stressed once in a while in order to understand from it and help you become better. I would say the majority of kids have plenty of free time now; considering sports and extra curricular activities are down in the country. Kids just waste there free time.

Taking the social element out of school and putting school online and in the home away from people, is the worst thing that can be done. We already have a whole generation who can't deal with there problems because they grew up in a box; it would only make things worse when you completely take out the human element in school and taking away the chance for kids to have relationships, make mistakes and figure out those mistakes on their own. This will allow them to grow and become a better person socially and academically.
