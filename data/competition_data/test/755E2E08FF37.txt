Dear Mr. Principle

I think that every student should perform community service because they need to learn how to help others and help the world from pollution. By doing community service it will have them learn the other troubles that some people may have. Some kids might struggle in a subject in school but have no tutor, or if an elderly needs help getting groceries, then people should them.

Some people might say that if they don't get paid or get a reward then they shouldn't do anything for someone, but one day there going to be an elderly person or someone who needs a tutor and then realise how much community service helps.

Community service also helps the Earth by cleaning it up because the trash that some people leave behind really hurts Earth. By cleaning trash up it will make the animals happy because the trash can mess up there homes, mess up there food, and mess up there body's. If the trash/pollution gets in there water source it can most likely give them a disease.

So these are my reasons why the students should do community service. I hope you agree with me so we can do community service.
