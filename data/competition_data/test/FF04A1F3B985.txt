Distance learning is a method of teaching in which a student can use technology to attend a class without ever stepping foot in a classroom. The idea of implementing it has been a hotly debated issue in the education community as some fear that the quality of distance education is lesser than one taught in person. Supporters of distance learning see it as a tool to remove the barriers of education and make it accessible to all people regardless of where they live or if they are differently abled. It is undoubtedly a good idea to implement distance learning into our classrooms as this would allow students who live in extremely rural areas and those who are differently abled to be given the same opportunities as their peers.

Everyone has a right to an education. no matter your sex, gender, nationality, ethnicity, or disability. To deny students who otherwise have no way of receiving a quality education the ability to use distance learning you are denying basic human rights. If a student has no other means of attending school then distancing learning should be a easy, free, and readily available option for them. critics of distance learning may claim that it is an inherently inferior education to in school teaching, but, if what they claim is true, why would the solution be to scrap the idea entirely, thereby completely alienating a portion of the population whose education these programs solely rely? If a system of teaching that is unequivocally necessary has fallen behind in quality, then the solution is to invest not divest. Building a greater infrastructure around distance learning, improving teaching methods, and innovating new technologies are not just a better option than scrapping the idea all together, it is the only option.

Distance learning is essential to maintaining every humans right to an education and should be grown and supported but its place in education should not be overstated. Distance learning should not apply to those who can attend school with no issues. to move an entire education system online would be an absurd over correction to the effect that new technology is having on our schools. Our school system needs to be renovated from the ground up to better ensure that every American is getting a quality education and distance learning is not the future of that system but rather an necessary addition for those who need it. The infrastructure requirements of moving every American student online is an impossible task that would serve to alienate more people that it enfranchises. Distance learning must be implemented as a tool in the tool box of educators because there are many times they will need it, but, there are sometimes when you need a hammer not a screwdriver. Students are not monoliths and each have their own learning styles. While some students would thrive under distance learning others would struggle and fall behind. More programs than just Distance learning will be necessary to ensure quality education to all.

Distance learning is unarguably a good idea. anyone who opposes such programs is either woefully under informed or does not support the rights of man. Distance learning is not, however, a cure all solution to our education woes, but, rather a small part of an even larger and necessary overhaul of the entire American education system.
