So do you think this technolgy to read emotional expressions is right? To start with like maybe reading animals probaly not reading us humans like we really dont need a meachine to read us we can read ourselfs. You can just see how your feeling that day and if your feeling good thtas good. I absoulty dis agree with this artical. How much money would we have to pay for these things anyway like there gonna be pretty expansive.

Also in the text us humans can read our firends once we get to know them we will know if there having a bad day. Eckman has classfied six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,sadness. Just stateing this im pretty shure i would know if i was all of them emotions maybe a meachine to read my future i would want to see. Also back to my point why buy this when there are much nearer things to buy. Maybe people that are depressed is gonna say thats not true im happy and all this.
