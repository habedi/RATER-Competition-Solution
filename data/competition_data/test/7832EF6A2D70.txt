Dear TEACHER_NAME,

This is a letter regarding about the new school policy about students doing sports if their grade is at least B. Many of us students have C in our grades. If you let only students with grades higher then a B play sports, most students will not be able to participate in these extra curricular activities. C is a passing grade so students should have the opportunity to try out for sports. What good does it do to have sports in our school when many students cannot participate? Students should be able to play sports because it might actually help them in their later careers.

Students that play sports have great athletic ability. The students know what their goal is in life and want to make it happen.

We should also let them have fun and be active. You should not use this policy because then very few people will join the sports. Students also can bond and show team work in sports. If only few students join, then the team will be pretty small. many students may want to play sports ,but they are not able to because of there grade. My point is that the students should be able to play if at least they are passing the grade.
