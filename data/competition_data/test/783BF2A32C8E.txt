Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. In my opinion attend classes online is a good option for student. In this essay i will explain why I am agree that student attend classes online and I will give some examples.

In my opinion classes online is a benefit for student because many student have to work for support parents. Take classes online can be excellent option. Student can take classes before go to the job or after. They have more time to do homework and have fun. In my case I took one class online during summer this class help me too much because i dont have to take two maths classes during the school year. Another reason that take classes online is a good option for student because some student dont have car to drive to the school or collage. This is a big problem for most of the student. They don't have a person who can take to the school. Attend classes online can be easy for those student because dont have to drive to another place. They can take classes at home in computer.

Attend classes online is a good option for student who can't pay the whole school year or collage. They can pay one or two classes online for year. After this students have to work and save money for another classes. Many student choose this option because they don't have to pay all classes in the same time they have time to pay each class that the student want to take. Also many students who want to go to the school or collage live by they self. They have to pay rent, telephone, food and another stuff. Those student who live bye they self have many responsibilities and is difficult to take classes at school for all day. For those student is benefit being able to attend classes online because that classes online can be just one or two hours per day.

I think attend classes online is a benefit for student who have a busy schedule at school. They miss a class that they have to take before the school year end. Student can take this class online during that school year at home. Also online classes is a good option for student who don't have time to go school because they have baby's. They have to be at home to take care of that baby's. Most of the student who have this problem have the opportunities to be a professional taking classes online at home.

In general attend classes online is benefit for student. They don't have to go to school for all day. They can take classes online at home. Online classes is benefit for students who have to work, students that don't have money for pay all classes at the same time and for students who have baby's. In my opinion for those student that I am ready mention, attend classes online is the best way to learning . All people can be a professional no matter if they can't go to school. Student can take classes for one or two hour and them make homework or go to the job. Also attend classes online is benefit because we can take this classes in the day when we have time.
