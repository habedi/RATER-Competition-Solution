I don't think that this will help the student's learn any better. This is just a way for the goverment to know what you are doing at all times. Just like back in the day we didn't have all of this techonogy and we lived life without anything to stupid. If you would of done something you would of got hung.

Technology now a day's has changed everyone's life some for the better but most of it has made it worse. How you might say? It made it worse by us not paying attition to what's really happening in are live and how everything is changing.

The goverment wants us to be like this so we only see what they want us to see. There tring to dumb us down by doing all of this to us. Just like this test I'm taking now it don't help me out it only helps the school out and now there trying to say if I don't pass this one test that i can't move on. If this test really matter and if school really matter, why don't I learn how to do my taxes, why don't I learn how do make food so i can live on my own, why don't we all learn something that can help us all and not learn about oh back in the 626BC this happened, that's not what we need to be learning about you know back in the day it was so different. When I say its different I mean that it was better. There wasn't people eating soap, well there was if you did something bad you mom and dad would make you put a bar of soap in your mouth.

The goverment is trying to make us depend only on them. When they shut off all the technology they know whats going to happen they are going to try to do what Hilter did. This is my point and im not the only one who's see's all what your doing. Just like this test I know no one will really and truly read this. It's just going to be some robot that took someone's job.
