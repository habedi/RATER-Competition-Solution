Dear Principal,

I believe that the policy one is better because students bring their phones to school to communicate with their parents. Students also bring their phones to school to let their parents know if they need to be picked up from school or if they need to stay later with a teacher. Allowing students to bring their phones to school is also helping parents because they will know if they need to pick up their child or not and they will know what their child is doing. I believe if you allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times they are less likely to be using them during class time. Allowing students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them some freedom and will result in them being happy. With policy two and not allowing them to have their phones at school at all is not a good policy because students will not be able to communicate with their parents to let them know if they need to be picked up or if they need to stay after school with a teacher. By allowing students to bring their phones to school there is a chance for them to disobey and use them during class time without the teacher being aware. As a punishment for using their phones during class time without permission, the students phone should be taken away for a period of time. After that period of time is up the parents should have to come and get the phone. I believe a punishment like this should have the students think twice about using their phone during class time. If students are allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and free time I don't think they would try to use their phones during class time because they already know when they can use it so they don't want to get it taken away before their free time. Thank you for your time and I hope you take this into consideration.
