Dear Principal,

Personally, I think that students that are athletes, should be held to a higher degree of learning than kids who are not athletes because, athletes have to be wise on and off the field or court. I think this, due to the fact that some athletes maintain a C average yet, they are great on the field due to their dedication and hard work. If they were to provide enough hard work in the classroom like on the field, they would be exceptional students.

I happen to be an athlete, and I have played every sport available so far and my grades have NOT held me from playing. I have good grades because I work in the classroom. I'm also a very good athlete. I do not have a lot of time for other activities I enjoy like, playing video games or watching television but, that does not keep from trying hard. I maintain quality grades and I have the work ethic of an athlete on, and off the field.

It is said that athletes tend to have better grades and I think that should be proven by the student-athletes here at SCHOOL_NAME and other schools across the nation. If athletes are challenged like this, they will learn to work hard and they will pick up on good qualities. And like any great leader that has these qualities, these student-athletes will have them too.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
