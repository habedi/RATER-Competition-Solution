Dear Principal:

I think that the policy change would be good for the school. Making it so that a student has to have a B average or greater instead of any grade average would raise the grades for the school. Students would raise their grades to participate in their favorite sports and activities. The school average grades would also go up dramatically. Many students only like school for the sports, so they will try to maintain their ability to play the sports and activities. There will always be a few students that will keep their C average grade, but there will be many students that will raise their grade to a B average and become a better student. The policy change would also help students behavior, a smarter student would be a kinder student. There are also many students that would already have a B average or greater, and many that will raise their average and try harder all together. The students will raise their Average, and in the process they will start liking school more and wanting to participate more often in school sports and activities and such. With a smarter school, more parents would want to send their children to the school, and the school would gain students. Having a smarter sports team would also increase the schools chance of winning games, because the students can concentrate on the game easier, and come up with strategies for the game. Even though the policy would raise the grades of most of the students to a B average, there will always be a few students that will maintain their C average. This policy change would be good for the students and the school.

Sincerely,
