Have you ever have an emergency in school? I'd had that's why policy number 2 is really important.

Sometimes student have emergency's, or probably we just want to call someone and make sure they are ok.

Everyone in the world use phones, but i think that the principle should let the students used the phone, during free time in school.

Student should not be allowed to use the phone during classes.

Sometimes I'd have emergency's for example: one day i didn't feel good my head was hurting during free time and i couldn't use my phone because the school didn't let us use it, and if they saw the phone i was going to be in a big trouble.

So i stay all the day in the school and when i got home i was really sick and had to go to the doctor, and it cost much more then just calling my parents to come and pick me up.

Another reason that cell phones are really important is when we have family members or little brothers stay at home by themselves.

We want to check on them and see if they are ok if nothing had happen in the house.

Having little brothers or sisters on the house by themselves is not safe, that's why you need a cell phone to communicate with them.

Without a cell phone you don't know if your mom or dad or anyone needs, how bout if it's really important, and you would like to help but without a cell phone you wont even know what's happening.

And if you do have a cell phone during your free time we could check the missing calls or if we need to call someone for an emergency, we could just call without getting in trouble, and without the teachers coming and start chasing you because we have a cell phone.

This is also a waste of time for the teachers too.

Having a cell phone in our hands we can live a little bit safer, a cell phone is not just play time, but it can safe our live, or maybe help someone by our cell phone.

That's why cell phone our really important to carry them around with us.
