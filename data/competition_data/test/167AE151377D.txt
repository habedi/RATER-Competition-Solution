Should your Principal make you do at least one Extracurricular Activity?

When your principal has decided that everyone should do an extracurricular activity, what would you think about that idea? If you want to do an extra activity at school then do things that could make you happy. Maybe try something new and you might be interested, learn more about it. I think that the principal should make kids do extracurricular activities but it should be optional. I will give reasons why the principal should make extracurricular activities optional and not something your forced to do.

Physical and Mental Strength

If you want to do an extracurricular activity then you should do one that you will really like and enjoy. Maybe you want to try something new, you can learn a lot from trying something new and you might even like and enjoy it. Maybe your very distracted about something going on at school or at home, you can try something you like and have fun. Doing a sport for your extracurricular activity can help you get stronger and improve your physical strength. You can hangout with your friends and make new ones, it can improve friendships.

Trying New Things

There are pros and cons to trying new things. What if you don't like your activity or you are struggling to understand? You can ask a friend or an adult to help, you can also try to switch. Some people try new things and they really enjoy it, maybe you tried something new and really enjoyed it. It can be hard to learn something you never new about but it can be fun sometimes.

No Extracurricular Activities!!!

Some people might not like doing extracurricular activities and that's fine. Many people might have things to do at home or places to go to. It can be useless and you probably know how to do many things. What if kids want to focus on their studies more than their activities? What if kids want to grow up being someone who focuses more in math or English but they have to do activities instead? Like what most parents say, "Focus on your studies."

What Would You Do?

Are you interested in doing extracurricular activities? What would you like to do for your activity? Would you like your principal make everyone do at least one activity? Try to do an activity that will help you grow. Maybe something that you and your friends will enjoy so you can have fun while socializing. What would you do?
