Facial Acting Coding System

In the article "Making Mona LIsa Smile" Nick D'Alto talls about a new technology named "Facial Acting Coding System", this type of new technology will identify your students emotions it will tell you if your studetns are happy, sad, angry or in fear. Teachers should be aware if students are understanding our class, if they are enjoying it and most important we shoould know if students are having raugh times in school or out of school.

In all schools there is studetns who half the time do not understand a lesson given by a teacher or electronic, students are embearrased to raise there hand and ask for help, students will rather miss the whole lesson and not understand than raise there hand and ask for the help they need. If we have the new "Facial Action Coding System" this would help studetns by grades, they would understand the subject and will be able to do their homework, test and quizzes with out a problem. so that means better grades.

Studenys will get bored during a class, when they get bored they will most likely not pay attention and wont do anything. If this technology were to be in classrooms this will help the teachers know when they are not focusing no moe, this would help teachers be better during a lesson. This will benefit the studetns from not paying attention.

Many teachers do not know there studetns. They do not know when students are going through something, if you look onlined the suicide percent is high because of bullying, bullying happens in every school. This technology will stop familys from loosing there kids to suicide. Teachers would be aware of studetns emotions and will get to know thre studetns more.

In conclusion this new technology will help all schools, teachers and stusdetns.
