Dear principal,

My opinion is that cell phones should not be allowed at all during the whole school time. I think it would distract us from our learning environments, and someone might accidentally leave their cell phone on and it might ring during a class. Students might get carried away and think that if the teacher lets us have it in the halls or lunch then they might pull it out in class. I know so many students would want to have their phone but that also might affect maybe a students relationship with a friend. Maybe a friend is so attached to his or her cell phone during school that the time she usually spent with her friends during a free period they would be on their phone. I guess policy one could be a reason that friends stop being friends because they end up not talking anymore. Just texting. So I think policy two would be the best choice and it would benefit the students.
