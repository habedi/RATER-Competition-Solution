Dear Principal,

I believe the first policy about cell phone usage at school is the best choice for our school. It states that students are allowed to have their cell phones at school as long as they are off during class time. There are many reasons I believe this is a wise choice. Three of those reasons are: teachers could get more done after he/she is finished with that day's lesson, students will not have to come use the office phone, and in case of an emergency when a teacher is not around.

First off, teachers could get more done after he/she has finished teaching a lesson if we could have cell phones at school. No teacher wants to take papers home and grade them. They would much rather get them done in the free time at the end of each class period, but they have to keep calming the class down from excessive talking and can never can get anything done. What if students had their cell phones? Teachers could get so much more done because students could text instead of talk.

Next, students will not have to be a nuisance to the school secretary and you, asking to use the office phone every other class period if we were allowed to have our cell phones at school. Doesn't it bother you when a student wants to use the phone to call their mom because they want to go home with someone after school? I know it would me. So, if students could use their cell phones, they could call their parents during break or lunch to ask those sort or questions.

Lastly, students could get help quicker if there was an emergency if we could use our cell phones. For example, if there was a fight during break in the court yard, a student could call the office to have an authoritative figure come break up the fight before it got too out of hand. Or, if something more serious happened, like a student bringing a gun to school. A student could call a faculty member, or the police to let them know of the serious danger.

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my reasons for a new cell phone policy. Please consider these reasons I have stated while you debate on which policy is best for our school system.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
