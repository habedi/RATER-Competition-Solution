Many classes require students to complete a summer assignment that has been created by the instructor before the first day of school. The assignments promote students to maintain their critical thinking skills and learn new material during the long break. They are incredibly beneficial to students because they prepare them for the classes they will be taking in the upcoming year. However, many pupils dread completing their teacher-designed summer assignments since summer is a time when students are supposed to have more freedom in choosing how to spend their time. Although teacher-designed summer projects provide students more insight on the format of the work they will be receiving throughout the year, summer projects should be student-designed because they would give students more creative freedom, grow skills necessary to success, and allow teachers to learn more about their students.

The freedoms offered to students are very limited at schools. Children are often reprimanded harshly when they do not comply to specific instructions. While some argue that this method of educating produces obedient and respectful citizens, it leads to the suppression of creativity and students feeling as if they do not have a voice in their own education. Giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects would incorporate some much needed creativity into standard school curriculum by promoting students to think abstractly and do beyond what is required of them. They get very few chances to pursue their passions and expand their knowledge beyond what is expected of them during the school year, so a student-designed project would empower them to think for themselves and take control of their education. Additionally, boredom during school and over the summer is extremely prevalent in young adults and children. A project that pupils could design on their own would entice them to deeply explore the topics they are interested in. Giving them more liberty in their projects would encourage them to get excited about what they are learning and provide them with more control over their own lives.

Student-designed projects would force students to grow their skills that are useful in the workforce and society. The American education system was designed during a time when the nation was industrializing, therefore much of the curriculum taught to children reflects the need of that time period for workers that are obedient and can follow instructions clearly. Education should coincide with current society standards and currently, creativity and innovation is highly valued in the workforce. Yet, young Americans rarely have the opportunity to grow the skills needed to be successful in the modern workforce. Implementing the use of projects designed by students would urge children to utilize the crucial asset of being able to do more than solely follow directions. A large proportion of students also lack the ability to proficiently manage their time and maintain organization. Student-designed projects would entail that students would not only complete their assignment, but create it as well. Therefore students would be forced to make a plan and spend more time on their projects. The practical skills that would be required to successfully complete a student-designed summer project would provide students with numerous long term benefits.

Many teachers have the goal of getting to know their students better. Student-designed assignments would help facilitate that goal. It is a challenge for many teachers to develop an understanding of the interests of each of their students, especially in the beginning of the school year. Also, standardized testing and standards-based learning has dramatically reduced the variety of teaching styles that teachers implement. While the standardization of education helps officials assess educators and recognize struggling students, it operates under the false assumption that every child functions and learns in the same fashion. In contrast to testing and teaching every pupil the same way, for a project created by students, children would be able to choose the methods they take to understand material. When teachers review the work of their young scholars, they will be able to recognize how they chose to learn, making it easier to cater to that student's needs throughout the year. Students often contain very bright and innovative ideas, and teachers could learn a great deal from their students. Allowing students to design their own projects would give teachers the opportunity to utilize some of their students' effective ideas and incorporate them into their own teaching. Teachers would be able to see trends in what their children are interested in and what helps them retain content. Educators deserve to gain more knowledge about their students and receive new ideas that they can include in the classroom that would help students learn in a more engaging way that suits their needs.

Summer projects should be student-designed because these projects would provide students with an increase in opportunities to think creatively, assist them in developing new useful skills, and give teachers more tools to ensure their students' success. Completing assignments for school are often a bleak part of a young student's summer. Utilizing student-designed projects would encourage students to continue learning over break with enthusiasm and would improve the quality of their educational experience.
