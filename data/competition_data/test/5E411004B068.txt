Dear TEACHER_NAME:

Some of my friends perform community service, for example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. I do not think we should have to do this unless we wanted to. For example, there are many things that some kids might have to do at home. There could be: homework, chores, or even babysitting. This could take a while and put stress on us if we had to do community service. We have things that we need to do, and we want to do. Therefore, I do not think we should be required to do any kind of community service unless we volunteered. An example of myself not having time is: I have to wash my dogs every afternoon, I have to do many chores, and babysit my younger sister until my parents get off of work, I have to do my homework, and take a shower. Some things that I would like to do is: watch TV, listen to music, go walking, or ride bicycles. If I had to perform community service every afternoon, or even once or twice a week, I would have no time to do what I want and need to do. For example, I go to school everyday. I get out of school, and ride the bus home and get home at 3:30 P.M. every afternoon. My father doesn't get off of work until 7:00 P.M., and my mother doesn't get off until 7:30 or 8:00 P.M.I have a younger sister, that's five years old in preschool. She has to be with me at all times until my parents get off of work. I couldn't carry her with me to do community service because she's young and she gets into everything. Another example is: washing all three of my dogs every afternoon. That probably takes about an hour or an hour and a half. Homework usually takes about an hour, and taking out the garbage, washing dishes, cleaning my room, sweeping the house, watering and feeding the dog, cleaning my bunny cage, mopping and dusting usually takes probably about another two hours. I would like to be able to do all of that, and watch TV and ride bicycles or something everyday. This would take up most of my time. Please consider about thinking of all of this and realizing not all children have time to do this, and most of us don't want to do this either. Thank you.

Yours Truly,
