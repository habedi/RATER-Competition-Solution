" What are you going to choose?" That is the sound of a student at a school which requires them to do an extra- curricular activity. Students enrolled at this school must do some sort of extra curricular activity, whether it is a sport, a spot on the yearbook club, or serving on the student council. I agree with the requirement of an extra curricular activity because it can help you find people with the same interests and lead you to new interests, it can help create a better community environment and it will help all the students mature and succeed in the future.

Participating in an after school activity can lead you to people that have the same interests and can lead you to other interests. i have been playing lacrosse for about 8 years now and as I've played throughout the years, I have discovered many different hobbies through my teammates such as cheer leading, track and field and rock climbing. I've also been able to make friends because I'm on a different team every season. I have made about 3 lifetime friends in lacrosse. I think this can happen with school lead activities. I think by being part of an after school activity, you can make lifelong friends, find people with the same interests and discover new hobbies.

Doing an after school activity can help create a better community environment. this kind of relate back to the previous statement about making friends.

by making friends, you can create less bullying. there is this saying, "strength in numbers", and I truly think this would happen with an after school activity requirement rule. By installing an activity requirement, you would help build a bully-free community.

Lastly, an after school activity would help students mature and prepare themÂ for the future. I babysit a little boy with downs-syndrome and i often take him to the park. When we leave, you tell he is a little bit more mature from when we first arrived. this is because hen has played with older kids and have copied their actions. I believe this goes with all kids. if we had an after school activity program and we put all the grades together, it would help the younger one mature but also the older kids could teach them how to do things that they will need to know in the real world.

I think everyone should be involved in some sort of group, whether it be school related or not. Maturing kids, better community environments and finding new friends can all happen with a required after school activity program.
