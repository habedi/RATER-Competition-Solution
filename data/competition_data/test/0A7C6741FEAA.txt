Phones and Driving

Over the past decade, cell phones have become a major issue behind the wheel. Many people don't understand the dangers it holds and how often they risk their life when they grasp that phone while driving. It is extremely hard for a person to multitask behind the wheel, they already have enough to pay attention to considering they're handling a two ton bullet. Not only is your life in danger when you use a cellphone while driving but others lives are too. Phone use while driving should be permitted at all times.

Life is precious. It should not be thrown away by a mistake that is always preventable. No text or song is more important than your, or others, life. Over the past decade, statistics for car accidents by distracted drivers has skyrocketed, roughly now about 1.6 million per year.

Recent research has shown that you are six times more likely to get into a car accident when texting, rather than driving drunk. People know this too, and they still attempt to send that text and believe nothing is going to happen. People already get distracted by their surroundings, why add another distracting and risk someone's life?

Most states have banned cell phones on the road, you can not touch them while driving.

It's called the "Hand-held Ban", it has been applied in most states of the U.S. It was recently applied to Georgia in the month of July. These hand-held bans have proven effective, in states around the country the ban was put in place and within a year, we have been shown a difference.

People seem to rely on their mobile devices for just about everything these days, there are ways around this, when in need to navigation just put it on speaker or mount it to the windshield.

There are definitely ways to still get what you need without breaking the law.

In conclusion, texting and driving has proven to take life after life. Even for innocent people just walking alongside the road and following the rules. The people who end up hurting or killing these innocent people have to live with it for the rest of their lives. Don't be that person, it is not worth it. It's not even worth it to get something as minor as a ticket. Cell phones use while driving should be permitted at all times.
