Do you think attending public school is beneficial for you? Attending public school is not beneficial for you. I have been attending public school all my life, and I think that they are nasty, and not safe. You might ask yourself well if attending public school is not beneficial for me what other option do

I got? Well thats where home school comes in play. Attending home school is beneficial for you; you will be more safe, you will be more focused, and you will be more comfortable.

My first reason on why attending home school is beneficial for you is that you will be more safe. some may argue that some public schools are safe, nevertheless most of them are not. I remember when I was in elementary school a kid used to bully everyone at school everyday it was horrifying some students would rather stay home than come to school and the school never did anything about it.

My second reason on why attending home school is more beneficial for you is that you will be more focused. some may say that focusing in class depends on the student, except thats not completely true. Researchers over at The University of Utah did an experiment where they tested students attending public and students attending home school. They made the students take a test on what they have learned that week. The test results turned out that students attending home school did 99.94% better than students in public school.

My final reason on why attending home school is more beneficial for you is that you will be more comfortable. Some students may get comfortable in public school and feel like its their second home, on the contrary students are usually more comfortable at home you do things at home that you would never do in school.

To sum up, attending home school is beneficial for you if you want safe, focused, and comfortable education.
