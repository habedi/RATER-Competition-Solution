Luke is very courageous because he joined the World War II. He left his family to save other peoples lives. He is hardworking because he is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Even though he got hungry and tired he didn't quit. He discovered unique places in the world and meet other people.

Luke helped people that are in the war and people that does'nt have food, water, and shelter. He would want other men to join the war because it made him feel good about hiself because he repected his country. Luke didn't even think if he wants to be a a military he just said yes because he knew that it would be a oppurtunity of a lifetime.

I think that people should join war, so that we could have our freedom by getting it ourselves, by fighting in war and being courageous like Luke. Luke can inspire people and wanting themselves to join the military. Most military says that "We die with honor".
