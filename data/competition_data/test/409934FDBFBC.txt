Dear Principal,

Community service is good for our health, and we need our community to stay clean. First, I would like to say that vehicles are one reason we need to clean the community. Second off, I would also like to point out how we throw trash on the ground, and we don't need trash on the ground we need more service to the community. I say that we do need to spend more time helping out this community, it would prove a great help for our people. We could learn how to just pick up something without being instructed to do so. We need a sapid community because with a decayed community we could get sick easily, and as students and educators we shouldn't want that. If we are sick we would not get chances at going to get better knowledge at school. That's why we need to clean our community, and as I said earlier we need to use cars less because they pollute our airspace, and if we breath in that pollution we get sick as well. Are you willing to let the community stand in harsh conditions or will you listen to my testimony? Just because my peers think the opposite does not mean you listen to them. They may sometimes have important things to do but that's does not mean they are prefect and can't help. Do you want a healthy environment for future generations to come? I want a great environment so we could get our education, play out side, and breath fresh air. I want all these things for the community wouldn't you want the same?
