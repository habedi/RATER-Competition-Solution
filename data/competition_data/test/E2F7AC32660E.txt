According to the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" Prof, Thomas Huang and Beckman institute, have made an invention"FACS", that is able to tell someones expressions using technology. The author states the emotions of Mona Lisa's portriat by using the new technology. Do you ever think is the new invention even worth the pay or even necessary? Many people can be against it and many for it. Myself personally I am for Facial Action Coding System.

The article states, you can tell someones emotions by just looking at them. It also states that we have trouble really describing the facial trait. By using FACS, we can get the actual facial traits in someones face.

According to the author, "'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly)." When using the Facial Action Coding System it recognizes the facial movements in a humans actual face even in paintings. Using the "While Looking in the Mirror" activity we followed the steps,but what if we were to add something that nobody knew except you. The person looking at you would think you are following the script. When you use that same exact script with the other facial you added, the technology would recognize it in an instant. The author also stated moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

In conclusion we all have our opinion, if using the FACS is good or not. The Facial Action Coding System is a technology Prof. Thomas Huang And Beckman institue invented to help people figure out what a painting is offering us in emotions or even what people themsleves are offering. Either wanting to use technology or our own brains, the only person who really knows is the person who painted the painting and the person giving the facial expression.
