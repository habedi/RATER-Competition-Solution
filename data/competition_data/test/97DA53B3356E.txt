Phones and Driving

Cell Phones have become a more modern technology which is why people have become more comfortable using them while driving. It is distraction that could end up being fatal. Not only are car accidents a result of using a cellphone while driving,but it also can cause road rage from other drivers,and traffic jams. People believe that they can multitask but truly the brain switch from one task to another which is not really multitasking. Cell phones should be banned while driving for a couple of different reasons. There are a lot of dangers when it comes to using a phone while driving.

While driving you should never look away from the road. It is one of the most important factors when driving. Not only are you putting yourself in danger,but also the lives of other drivers and pedestrians. Texting while driving is one of the leading causes of death to people age 16-25. If you are texting your eyes are not on the road and your hands are not on the steering wheel. There a lot of different distractions such as smoking,eating,looking in the mirror,talking,and loud music. That could cause a car accident. But texting while driving has made its way to the top of the list.

Most people believe that hands-free electronics are not a distraction and don't pose danger to drivers but they actually do. Whether a person is texting or just talking, they are not focused on the road and this slows their reaction time. People think that if they are just talking and listening, with eyes still on the road, not taking them off, that they are just as alert as a driver not talking on a cell phone. But that is not the case a study showed that "In 2001, they found that even hands-free cell phone use distracted drivers. In 2003, they revealed a reason: Drivers look but do not see, because they are distracted by the conversation. The scientists also found previously that chatty motorists are less adept than drunken drivers with blood alcohol levels exceeding 0.08. (Britt)". Which provides evidence that drivers using a hands-free device are just as distracted as one who is texting.

In conclusion the cons of this argument outweight the pros. No life is worth a quick look at a cellphone. So due to the information provided cellphones as well as hands-free devices should be banned while behind the wheel of any type of vehicle.
