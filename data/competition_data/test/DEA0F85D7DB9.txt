Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Hello I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME the school that you are the principle of. I would like to persuade you to not allow phones at school for three reasons. One they will distract students and they will not be able to do the work that is given to them. Second they will use there phones at school to call there parents to get them because they do not want to be at school. Last, teacher will find that students are no longer paying attention to them and pull out there own cell phone and use it to call friends and family. So those are the reasons that I think that students should not be aloud to bring their phones to school.

First the students will like this new policy that allows cell phones at school and I think that this is a bad idea. the students will be in class and texting other student in different classes or even in the same class. They will not be able to concentrate on what they are doing if they are texting there friends.

Second they will try to call their parents to come and pick them up. kids do not want to be at school so there is no way that people will not try to get their parents to get them. Students do not want to be studying the Greeks they rather be playing video games and do other thing at home.

Third teacher will want to pull their phone out and text and call friends and family. Then no one is being taught any thing and no one will learn. people will not care about school any more and just stay home.

So if there is any choices that you would take I would advise this one. this is the best choice because students will be distracted, they will call their parents to come and get them, and lastly teachers will start texting in class.

your truly,
