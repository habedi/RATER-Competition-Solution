Stop arguing with me Bob, I know I'm right about the face on mars. How could you think the face was created by aliens, thats just crazy. You have no evidence to prove your point about how you think aliens created the face. I on the other hand have plenty of evidence to support my claim.

When the "Face on Mars" was first discovered the Viking 1 had found it by mistake. The Viking 1 was looking for a place for its sister ship to land, and stumbled on it by mistake. The picture the Viking 1 took resembled a human face but, it was very shadowy and not the clearist picture. When NASA reveled the "Face on Mars" it became the instant topic everywhere. Everywhere you went peope talked about the face.

NASA wasn't done with the face on Mars. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Web sufers everywhere were whating for the first image to appear. When the imaage first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after. But of course not everyone was satisfied. Sadly it was winter it on the Red Planet. Thanks to all the wispy clouds, the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Sadly clouds had covered parts of the Face. Some people still thought the Face was hiding alien markings.

On April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. What was it going to find on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia? What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It didnt't show any airplanes or Egyptian-style pyamids.

See Bob I have so much more avidence than you. Your alein markings were proven not true. All The Face actully showed was a butte or mesa. There were no alien Egyptian style markings. The face is just a simple land form on the face of the Red Planet.
