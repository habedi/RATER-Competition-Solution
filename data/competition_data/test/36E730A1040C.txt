what I thank about required to do community service.

I thank community is a good it helps the earth and the plant and anemia's .

Its just community service is good and all but havening to do will be a pain it would have a affect kids will have less time to do homework.

it is also a lot of work community service havening to pick up trash that someone slets is throw out.

I personally would not do community service because i thank people sould throw it away thane self's thare the ones who did it in the first place . community service is also can be a punishment of people who gone to jail the so community service can be a punishment for bad people . community service is a waste of time it is because we soudnt have to pick up for someone slets .community service is good for the earth maybe but it just takes to long to pick up from someone slets trash.
