Dear Principal,

I think community service is needed because there are sometimes that people buy snacks like, chips, candy's, or something to drink theirs trash cans and some people just don't throw it away in the trash can they just throw it on the ground and leave it there and I think community service is needed because their just students that just buy things and throw it on the ground and i get really mad when they just throw the trash like that in school.

Me that I am in SCHOOL_NAME TEACHER_NAME my SCHOOL_NAME teacher tells us students to pick up the trash that's all around our school and I agree with him because If our parents or other people come to our school and looks that there's trash everywhere their gonna think what terrible school SCHOOL_NAME is so I would do community service but now everything has changed now a days our school kind of looks clean because we don't want people to think what kind of school SCHOOL_NAME

is. Yes students should be required to perform community service because for example If students do community service some schools wouldn't of been unclean should I say and dirty like some school are like so If students did perform community service United States would be clean like before. So I thinks yeah community service is needed for different kinds of schools around different districts around SCHOOL_NAME districts or SCHOOL_NAME districts some students in different schools litter and we should stop that If we do community service. We should support c
