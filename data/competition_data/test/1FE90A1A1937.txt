Can you imagine a world where no one has to ride the city bus or try to get a taxi? This could happen in the future if companies like Google continue to try to upgrade their driverless cars. This idea is just in the very early steps at the moment, but with more regulated test-drives and advances in technology this could be a reality.

There are many questions like: If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault? If this technology was put into action before it was ready for every possiblity then the blame would fall upon the manufacturer and the government for it's approval. The only cars that are close to completely driverless still require the human to be in the driver's seat and remain focused at all times if needed to take over in certain situations. Computers do not make mistakes, humans do. If not laced with the best programming and top of the line technology, this car could be a failure.

Everything falls back on the maufacturers. If they can provde the world with a driverless car that is reliable and keeps humans out of harms way it would be amazing. Until the driverless cars are perfected they should not be used by the public. The blame if something goes wrong should only be placed on the maufacturers who were relied on to make a safe and easy alternative to human-controlled cars we use today. riverless cars is an idea that can soon be achieved with the right research and testing.
