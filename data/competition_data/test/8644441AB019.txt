Dear Principal,

I understand that you are considering only letting students with a grade B average join the sports teams. I am sorry but I think this is not a good idea. Many students with a grade C average are just as smart as the other students and also as good at sports. Also, if you stop letting those students be on the teams you are not going to have enough people trying out to make a team.

I am a grade C average student and I am on all the teams. I still keep my grades up. I have been a grade C student my whole life. That's just who I am, and if you are going to punish me for being the same student I have always been, I'm sorry, but I think you are not considering the students. We all try to be are best, sometimes we just fall short of what we are expected to do. You should look at this in the perspective of the students. We all love sports and love playing them. I hope you read this letter and consider every possibility.

Sincerely,

The Student Body.
