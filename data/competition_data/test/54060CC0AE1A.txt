Do you think that the face was created by aliens or is it just a landform? I belive that it was just a natral landform and its just one of them illusions that looks like something but its not. In the passage it said that NASA had unvield the image for everyone to see with the caption "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes ,nose,and mouth

NASA believed that people would pay more atention to mars acording to the article " The authers reasoned it whould be a good way to engage the public and attract atention to mars." "it certanily did" the faceof mars has become a pop icon it was in hollywood films ,books,magazines,raido talk shows even in haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25

In conclusion peope today still believe that it was created by aliens but I still believe that its just a landmark on a diffrent planet. What do you belive? Was it aliens or is it a landmark?
