Dear Principal,

I believe that you should use policy two because students always bring their phones to school. some bring their phones to school for important reasons like having an after school activity and needing to get in touch with their parents who are at work far away, and that is okay because some students leave their phones in their locker. But on the other hand some students abuse this and text during class when the teacher is not looking or even when the teacher is looking. Some people even have their phones with them during the school day and did it on accident forgetting to put it in their locker and then they still get in trouble if it goes off in the middle of class because the teacher does not know if the student is telling the truth or just lying to not get in trouble. If you enforce the policy I believe that then more student will listen to the policy because they now know that if they bring their cell phones to school they will be penalized. These are a few reasons why I strongly believe that you should choose policy two.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
