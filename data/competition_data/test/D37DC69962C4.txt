The Face on Mars cordinates are 41 degrees north latitude. There are people who still don't belive this. It was cloudy outside blocking the Face aliens could have been hidding. To prove that it's true on anothe day that was vividly cloudless, in the summer Mars Global Surveyors went back to mars for a second look.''Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.'' The pixels spans of images came back 1.56 meters to the Viking photo 43 per pixel. Since then the pixles have been enlarged by 3 times their size.'' So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes in the ground [around] or Egyptains-style pyramids or eve smalll shacks, you could see what they were.
