I think all students should perform community service because its for a good cause, and there is some people that do need help out there. For example people that are in a wheelchair and people that cant see. There is also help needed on cleaning up streets because a lot of people throw their trash in the streets. Sometimes even in lakes or beaches and people don't think of the damage its going to cause the fish or other living things in the water. Also sometimes you could volunteer in painting a house or even cleaning a house for someone that is not in the condition of cleaning. You can also help the environment in planting trees so that there could be less pollution on the earth.

You can also volunteer in teaching people that are interested in learning another language like for example Spanish or French.

Also you can help do the easiest things like taking out the trash or raking leaves for a neighbor. You can also start a club that collects food for people that are homeless and clothes. On winter days you could collect blankets for people that don't have a home and sleep in the streets. Also you can collect cans and then recycle them, at school you can recycle your paper, and at home you can recycle any plastic bottles.
