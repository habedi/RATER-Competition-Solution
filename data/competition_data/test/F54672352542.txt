Should Schools Allow Student-Assigned or Teacher-Assigned Summer Projects?

How many times have teachers assigned summer projects, yet you only get half of the students' projects? Aren't you tired of getting only half your students' projects and having to chase students down to complete their projects. When will you learn students aren't interested in teacher-assigned projects. Why not give something else a try, like student-assigned projects. Instead of teacher-assigned summer projects, why not try student-assigned summer projects. It allows to student to be creative, work independently on projects like they will in future, and get students interested in their projects. For schools to assure students continue learning effectively over the summer they should allow summer projects to be student-assigned.

Schools allowing student-assigned summer projects allows students to design and customize their own projects to their own interest. Being able to allow students to pick a topic you're passionate about gets students interested in their summer projects. Since students are allowed to pick their own topics, the project is on something that they're interested in. Students have a chance to choose a topic they have an interest for or are passionate about. Therefore, this sets students up to become immersed in their summer projects. Student-assigned summer projects allows students to explore new topics that can spike interest for students to pursue a possible, future career path.

Having projects be student assigned allows students to work independently on projects as practice and preparation for independent study projects for college. In college student-assigned projects or independent study projects are assigned often, especially in STEM fields. To help students prepare for college, student -assigned summer projects will give them a preview as to what it is like to do an independent project. Students all ready feel high schools don't prepare them for college, but student-assigned projects can get students that needed preparation for college. Schools allowing student-assigned projects are helping their students to receive necessary preparation for college.

Some educators and students believe that teacher-assigned projects are the better choice over student-assigned projects. They think it will give more structure to the project, projects will explicitly follow the curriculum, and students will know exactly what they have to complete for the project. However, all teacher-assigned projects do is stifle creativity, lose student interest, and cause students to become more dependent on teachers for ideas. For example, whenever I have teacher-assigned projects I get excited about the project, but I forget about the rubric. Once I remember there is a rubric to be followed, all of my creative ideas for the project dissipate because they don't follow the rubric guidelines. Student-assigned projects allow for more creativity, students aren't bound by a rubric.

Schools should allow student-assigned summer projects, since it allows students to open up their minds and become creative thinkers. Teacher-assigned projects stifle the creative young minds of students. Assigning independent student projects allows students to independently explore their interest, prepare them for college, and lets students use their creative brains to learn. Student-assigned summer projects help students learn effectively over the summer break.
