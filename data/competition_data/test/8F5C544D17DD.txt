Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a great way to build leadership and communication skills. I think all students should be required to perform community service because it is a good way to meet more people, be active in the community, and build leadership and communication skills. Many teenagers have activities, so they are busy, but I think that community service is a great way for us to use our free time.

Most students have lived in the same town since they were very little, so they know many of the other students. It is hard for them to move away from their circle of friends and get to know other students on a more personal level. Cleaning up a park with other people is a great way to meet new people and help the environment. It is fun to have a lot of friends because then there are more people to hang out with. It is good for a person's self esteem and happiness. Doing something good for others can be good way to make new friends at the same time.

Teenagers like to think of free time as watching television, going on Facebook, and playing video games. Community service is good because it helps people be more active within the community and physically. It actually makes a difference for others. Personally, I think that putting a smile on someone else's face feels much better than getting mad because I can't pass a level on a video game. Community service puts the overall community in a good mood.

When students get older and want a job, it is important that they have good leadership and communication skills. If someone has good leadership skills, they could become a boss or a manager and make the company successful. When a group has a project to do it is important to have good communication skills, so that the outcome and the relationship between co-workers are good.

Community service has no bad outcomes. I think it helps a person become kinder and have a higher self esteem. It is a good way to meet more people, be active in the community, and build leadership and communication skills. After reading this letter, I hope you consider requiring all students to perform community service.
