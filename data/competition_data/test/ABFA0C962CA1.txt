Extra curricular activities give students an opportunity to be on a team or with a group of people with shared interests as them. They are very beneficial for students, but many kids don't participateÂ in after school activities because they are to busy with school.

Because some parents force there kids to spend little to no time with there friends and hours studying. Their kids may end up with little social skills and poor mental health. Though excessive time studying may seem beneficial; to much time studying actually harms the students. Mandatory extra curricular activities would help to give students more control over their lives and let them to have a social life. Many adults would have never thought to try any after school activities if their school didn't force them to, yet so many parents don't allow there kids to participate in those activities that they once loved as a kid. A lot of students feel at ease when doing a sport or playing their instrument, and they never would have thought to try it if they had no reason to. Making students participate in extra curricular activities is beneficial for their physical and mental health because it helps students make more friends and find their passion.

Since there is so much pressure for student to maintain a high GPA, some students make studying more of a priority than their social life. It gets so extreme to the point where some students spend all there time doing homework, but spend little to no time hanging out with their friends. This makes students struggle socially. Extra curricular activities give students a chance to take a break from homework and be in a group of people with the same interests and same goal as them. Pushing students to do extra curricular activities would help them to spend less time studying and more time spent on an activity that they love. There are a lot of students that are strong academically, but many of those students can't communicate with other people or work in a team, so no matter how smart they are they wouldn't excel in any job. Because every job requires communication and social skills, students need to develop those skills while still in school to get a secure job in their future. Increasing communication and teamwork is not the only reason that after school activities are beneficial.

There are many adults that would have never found their passion if there weren't activities for them to try. Since stress is only increasing for students, they tend to spend more time studying trying to improve already good grades then doing an activity that they love. Students feel so stuck feeling like they can only do school work, but when they have other activities it can really clear their head; as well as make them realize that they work well in a certain field. For example if a student were to join the SCA and like it they could realize that they want to take on more leadership roles and one day run a company. If that student was forced to study and had no free time to be on the SCA they may have never realized how much they like leadership roles. They may have never gotten the chance to start the company and there life would be so different. Plus students are more likely to get accepted in a good college for continuing with an activity that they love with a slightly lower GPA then having a perfect GPA, never have participating in any extra curricular activities, so after school activities are also helping students to get into college.

A lot of extra curricular activities are offered, and by making them mandatory it will make many students realize that they are passionate about some things. Whether that activity be a sport, an instrument, or a leadership role. While there is something out there for everyone students wanting to participate in an activity isn't as common as many may think. Pushing students to find their activity will help them in their future. There is no way out of communication and teamwork so giving students the opportunity to learn those skills in school only benefits them. By not enforcing extra curricular activities on students, many students futures are being harmed. By not letting kids have social lives or giving students the opportunity to find their passion students are going to struggle in their future adult life a lot more then they ever needed to struggle. This can be avoided by just simply making after school activities mandatory; having students focus on things other then school and studying.
