community service for students should be only for kids who deserve it not for others.

but kids who want to do it should be able to do if they want to.

for those who don't should have the right to say no i don't want to do that.

but community service is a nice thing to do if you really feel like doing it.

you shouldn't be forced to do it though because we have the right to say no.

kids should be paid a couple dollars if they put effort into the community service.

community service is almost like labor cause people are working when they don't want to work.

so to make a kid work like that is almost like child labor.

only if people want to work then it wouldn't be labor cause it would be something that they want to do right. so if we kids do want to work we have rights we can say no.

community service should only be judged by the court of law not by schools.

anybody who has done community service before probably is use to it.

but people that are new to it might be a little scared. or maybe even not wanting to do it.

that's why it should be referred to labor because we don't want to do it.

so really if students want to be in on community service then that's fine but if not then they should not have to join. me i wouldn't go to community cause it might not be good for me to always worry about my sugar.

but if you ask me i might clean up a thing or 2 because i partly care about our world.

seeing carts in the parking lot and trash laying around its just sad and pure laziness.

so please everybody if you see trash or courts anywhere try to take them back to where they belong. if you see somebody pushing carts but not to where they belong please take the cart back or pick up other peoples trash so the world is 1 step cleaner.
