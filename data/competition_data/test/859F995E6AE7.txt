The support of this idea and why is dngers study Venus is on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These contions are far more extreme than anything humas encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottesr suface temperature of any planet in our solar sytem. Venusian geology and weather present aditional impediments like erupting volcanes. Venus was prebably covered lagerly with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientidts to float above the fray. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exeed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivble for humans. Peering at Venus from shipnorbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from distance. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubs but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
