Dear principle,

I personally don't think everyone should be required to do community service. first of all, we spend most of our day in school working hard so for us to get home and have to go right back out and work some more is not necessary or right. Don't get me wrong i don't have a problem with doing community service i just think we need as much free time as we can get. On the other hand, Some students don't really have anything to do or look forward to at home and some of us do. I have football practice, track practice, and even basketball practice i wouldn't have the time to do community service even if i wanted to.

Some kids are in conditions were they cant do community service maybe because they're going through problems at home or they don't have an adult around to push them and encourage them to do the right thing. In high school its a requirement to have a certain amount of community service hours so if i don't se the point of us doing it now if we just going to have to do it all over again.

In conclusion i think us students should be able to decide if we want to do community service or not because some of us either cant do it or just don't want to do it. So if our principle is forcing us to do something that we really don't want to do then its most likely not going to be done.
