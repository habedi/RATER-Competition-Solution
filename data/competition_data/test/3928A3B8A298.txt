Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I strongly disagree with this policy. As you can clearly see many of the students have a grade C average. This change will be unfair to a lot of the students. Some student may even rebel against the school.

There are few students who have a grade B average or above. Also most of the schools athletes have a grade C average. If those student were to be kicked out i doubt there will be enough players on the team to play. There is also the fact that activities like the ones we offer help kids stay away from gangs, drugs, and other dangerous activities like those. I believe that you should not change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average.
