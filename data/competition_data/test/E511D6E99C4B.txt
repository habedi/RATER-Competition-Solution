I agree with the first policy because say that there was an accident after school and you were on your way home and you tripped and feel, ooops you just broke your leg were is your cell phone so you can call the paramedic's. its all ways a good idea to have a cell phone so your ready for an emergency. phones aren't all way's for emergency's though, there a good way to communicate with family or friends.

phones are also used for entertainment like listening to music and teens like to listen to music on there free time or during lunch. its fair if teens listen to that rule because the principal is letting use phones as long as we turn them of during class. I personally don't own a phone but I think that they are still important to have.

phones are good sources for info they can serve as a thesauruses/dictionary, you can surf the world wide web for specific reasons. they can help you with your homework or help you with a project. cell phones can be used for storing info as well for example the black berry touch can save school work documents that you can give to your teacher by e-mail. so phones aren't a big distraction they are the opposite they are a big help.
