Dear Principal,

As you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.

But there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.

If these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.

Sincerely,
