This system could be very benificial in classrooms for many reasons. One reason being this system can literally tell what all of your emotions are an what percent each of them are. How a student feel about school or a class can effect how they do in school or the class big time. If a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse, this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be. If a student loves the class and loves going to school then obviously they will be more ingaged and do better in the class most of the time.

Schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more. Them doing this would hopefully improve grades and attitudes toward school which could always lead to more students wanting to go to college. There are alot of long term very benifical plans that could come with this.
