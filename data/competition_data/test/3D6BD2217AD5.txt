Some schools think that students should keep learning over the summer. I think that the project should be student designed. If we are doing the project we should be able to design it to. Think if the does the design and we don't know it we can't ask because it's summer. Now let me tell you how it would be better if we designed the project instead of the teachers.

If the students design the project it could be more understanding for them. Which is a big help for them and so they an get a higher grade. We could do more research on what we know and we can put down some facts that the internet doesn't know. Like if a basketball player plays a certain amount of games the internet would know but they wouldn't know their play style that the teacher or internet didn't know. The internet doesn't know everything and neither does the teacher so you should design the project yourself.

Say if the teacher designed the project and you have to look up research on the subject it might not have all the truth on the internet. The teacher may know may know more than the internet about the project which makes it unfair to the student. Thats why the student should be designing the project thats why the students should design the project. Like if the BET awards was coming on television the teacher may know when its coming on but you could know who the special guest coming on the show. The teacher could not know that but thats why you could inform them on that when the project is done.

The teacher knows you likes shoes so the teacher asigns you a project about shoes. So you go to do your research about some shoes you have so you look them up and it doesnt say their limited edition. So you have to tell your teacher the shoes aren't regular shoes and your teacher says yes they are and you say no their not. You show your teacher that their limited edition basket ball shoes and you corrected your teacher so the teacher gets mad and gives you a lower grade on the project when you got a 100 for the project. Therefore you should design your own project so the teacher doesnt get mad if you correct them on something.

So you just learned that you should design you own projects. So you can look up the right fatcs on your project instead of listening to the internet or teachers. Or tell your teachers whats going to happen on a certain show and spoil it for them. Or tell them how a certain player plays the basketball game when they play as hard as they can against the hardest team. Or get a bad grade because of correcting the teahcer on a type of shoes that are limited edition. Moral of the story students should design their own projects.
