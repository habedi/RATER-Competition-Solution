Have you ever wondered what it would be like to land on another planet? Maybe even Venus. The author includes various reasons why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. One of the main reasons that people want to study more about Venus is because its considered Earth's twin. You are probably wondering how could Venus be "Earth's Twin" considering that the atomsphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,Temperatures on the surface can get to 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the armospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we expierence on Earth.

Even with the dangers of Venus,its still considerd Earths twin because it is the closest thing to Earth in terms of density and size. Also like Earth, long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans and life. For example the text states" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life." this is an example of how Venus could be a worthy persuit. Another example thats stated in paragraph 4 is "Futhermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." This is an example that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Now that you have read about some of the challanges that have stopped people from landing on the surface of Venus, even though its so similar to Earth. Could you agree that striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value?
