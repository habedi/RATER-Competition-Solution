The summer projects should be student designed because student designs are more creative and have more thought to it and it is simple. Teachers make the work to complicated and it is hard to do without a teachers help. Students can make it easy for themselves because they can make or find ways to make it simple and easy. Students can go on websites to gather information or have a sister or brother help maybe parents. For me a student i think it easier to have my own design because the teachers stretch the assignments they make u add supporting detail or show your work or all that extra information that we dont need.

Honestly i really dont think we should have summer assignments because whats the point in having summer break if we are assigned school work. If i want a job how am i supposed to complete these projects another reason why i think it should be student designed because if i am working all day then i can base my project on that where as a teacher would base the projects on stuuf that i wouldnt be able to have time to write about or create or grab information. I feel that if we are going to have to do work in the summer then we should be able to create our own projects not assigned teacher projects. The Teacher designs should only be for the people who need it, the students deisgns should be for the ones who dont need it because they dont need it. The teachers designs should consist of work that will help the ones who need it and the student designs are should be what they have learned through the school year.

In conclusion teacher and students designs should be based off the kids grades and efforts in schoool. Teachers shouldnt give hard and unessecery work if not needed and students should be able to create their own designs. I believe that students would do much better if the projects were student designed. During the school year it would be good if some of the assignments were student designed. Students would have at least C's and not F's because of the projects that they create.
