I think we all should do community service. It would really help the environment to be a whole lot better. There's a program where you sign up to do daily work after school to help clean up that people do. I do my best to keep my family from littering, because I wanted to be in the program but my mom said that she doesn't have time to pick me up after it. Since I can't be in it I told my mom that I am going to be picking up trash when ever I can. She said that I could do that. Most of my friends do try to clean up, but they don't have time or their mom's won't let them. so they don't litter so it at least doesn't make it worse. Most of my family doesn't litter, because one of my cousins hate it when people litter . So she don't yell at them they don't litter. And if they do they don't do it in front of her.
