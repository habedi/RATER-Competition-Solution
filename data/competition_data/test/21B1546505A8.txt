Summer projects are common all over the world. They are used to make sure that students are maintaining their knowledge, and even getting some background information for the next year. These assignments can be designed and formed by teachers, or even students. Student designed summer projects are much more beneficial for the kids, making them more interesting, taking less time from their breaks,Â and even giving students more room to work freely. Students shouldn't decide on all of their project terms; rather, they should write themselves a prompt or question to work around, and have it approved by the teacher.

Primarily, student-made projects are much more interesting to the students working on them. If the students themselves are selecting their topic, or project type, it will result in a more enjoyable experience for the kids. In turn, raising the number of students who actually do their projects, and make sure that they are getting the experience they need. Sure, teacher designed assignments are good for making sure that the student is working on something that will relate to their next year of schooling, but if teachers take full control it will leave students stuck with a tough topic that they cannot write passionately about.

When teachers let students design their projects, they are giving the students much more room to work freely. Students will have a topic that they will actually care about, a topic that will fuel the students brain to create what they want to create. When students are allowed to stick to something that they are passionate about, they will work as hard as possible to convey their points effectively. If teachers would just give their students the freedom that they need, they wouldn't be stuck writing around some arbitrary prompts, instead giving the students the ability to write about what they truly care for. Students won't have anything to restrain them from writing as best they can.

Student assigned projects will even take away less time from the summer for their work. If students enjoy their topic and are passionate about it, they will take less time to finish it. This is very much a good thing because it will give the students the break they deserve, while still giving them enough to do so that they won't empty their brains during summer. If the students don't get the summer they worked so hard during the school year for, they will burnout, mental health among teens will lessen, and they will be stressed out of their minds.

In conclusion, students should design their summer assignments. Student designed projects will benefit the kids in many ways, including making the work more interesting to the student, giving them more freedom within their work, and even cutting down on summer time stolen by their school work. When students are allowed to pick their topics and prompts for their summer assignments, the schools will see nothing but improvement, in grades, work turned in, and most importantly, mental health.
