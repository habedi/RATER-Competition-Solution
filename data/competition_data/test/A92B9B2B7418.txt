Dear Principal,

If you were to change policies regarding participation in sports many students might not be able to play anymore. Numerous students enjoy playing sports for their school's teams. It is easy to maintain a C average and still play sports, that is what many students are doing now. I am sure that you and I would both want our students to play in our extra curricular activities. If you were to change the minimum grade average to a B that could lead to drug use to occupy their usual practice and game time, less scholarships for sports from our school, and fewer members from our school participating in sports and other activities.

My first reason of supporting no change in the grade average for sports is that without sports students may fall behind even more than they already are and go to drugs for something to do. If their practice and game time is not filled their last resort is going to be drugs and alcohol. This would not be good for our school and we want to keep our students as safe and healthy as we can, wouldn't you agree? Our students love playing these sports and i don't think we should take it away from them and replace it with drugs and bad grades.

Likewise, If our students who couldn't get the B average are out of sports, they won't be able to go to the college they deserve. Their skills would be hidden and colleges wouldn't give them a chance. Many students are given the opportunities of a life time because of the skills that they have in their sports and activities. Parents are also helped when their children play sports because they could get some sort of scholarship and that would help the family financially. If our students don't get into the good colleges, the colleges will see our school as a whole would as not so good and give students from other schools a better chance. Our school's won't get as good rates from colleges. Our reputation as a whole would be out into jeopardy.

In addition to drugs and less scholarships many students would be out off the team because of their grades. Our school's sports team will be beat, and we will be seen as the "weak team- that anyone can beat". For example there could be a student who is absolutely magnificent at football and he is the only star quarterback, but he can't keep a solid B average so he is kicked off the team and than we don't have a quarterback. I don't think you or I would want that for our school. I wouldn't want our school to be looked down upon like that.

In conclusion I think that the minimum grade average to be able to participate in sports should stay at a grade C average and not change to a B average. I think is should stay the same because students may be pulled into drugs easier, there will be less sports related scholarships from our school, and our sports teams will fall behind. We shouldn't pressure our students like this, because it isn't fair to them.

Thank you,
