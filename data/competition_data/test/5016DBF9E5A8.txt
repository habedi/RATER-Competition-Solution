Whether it's a lovable hobby of yours or an aspiration, there is always a task a person loves to carry out.

Mandatory extracurricular activities would be a phenomenal addition to the requirements of our school.

I find this decision to be fantastic because it gives the opportunity to students to practice unknown activities and find new passions that drive them forward.

In addition, the school too would benefit from the growing skills and work put out by the students through extracurricular activities.

The first reason why I agree with our school in this decision, is because it will provide the opportunity for both me and my classmates to practice the unknown and find new passions for us to follow.

This practicing of new activities will provide us students a development in our skills.

For instance, if I were to become the head of the student council I would experience how to become a leader, the skills needed to be a leader, and how to drive my classmates to become better students.

Secondly, a new drive or passion for our motivation could become discovered through the practicing of extracurricular activities.

As a result of this finding of new passion or drive, both me and my classmates would be able to figure out what it is we really aspire to be in the future to come.

Finally, the experience that would be provided to us through extracurricular activities, be it sports, leadership roles, or other extracurricular activities that are available to us, would be extremely helpful in our futures.

Specifically, the work ethics that would be highly important in our future in college and even when having a job, these work ethics would be taught like wildfire in any extracurricular activity as long as participation and active engagement is exercised.

The growing passion and drive combined with the learning of skills and work ethics will surely benefit both me and my schoolmates in the future to come.

As for the second reason I support my school's decision, it is due to the fact that my classmates will not be the only to gain through the mandatory extracurricular activities rule, the growing skills along with the hard work that will be progressively demonstrated by the students will surely benefit the school in more ways than one.

A major part of any school, the yearbook, could be made and designed by the people who are inside of the yearbook.

Specifically, the feelings, emotions and bonds created and felt throughout the year by myself and by my schoolmates, could only be expressed inside a yearbook through the people who made those bonds and felt those feelings.

However, that is not the only benefit, the students of the school will also be able to make a more deep and connecting bond through both the teachers and through each other.

For instance, not every club or sports team can run by a teacher or by a student, this diverse teaching environment that will be provided will prove to show a deeper connection through my schoolmates and through their main learning environment.

Lastly, the improvement of attraction to our school will encourage every student to work harder and become better students along with better learners.

In depth, the increased need to work hard and utilize the skills learned through extra curricular activities will increase the grades, performance, and attentiveness of many students in class and outside of class.

All in all, this decision will not only grow myself along with my classmates, but the school in a whole.

The third and final reason why I agree and wholeheartedly support the decision of my school is because both me and my schoolmates will be able to grow mentally, and physically through the extracurricular activities.

First off, the improvements of the number of people participating in extracurricular activities will prove beneficial for people who are in study groups.

As a result of the increased amount of people taking extracurricular activities, an increased amount of people will join study groups which will allow more sharing of knowledge through older members and newer members.

Secondly, sports teams will be able to have more competition, therefore increasing the skill gap between players.

More people participating in extracurricular activities means more people trying out for sports teams which results in a higher demand to play for the team, whether it be basketball, soccer, football or other sports, the high demand will cause an increase in specific member choosing for the teams and will also cause an increase in team spots, therefore increasing the skill of the teams and creating more ways for myself and other students to play sports and grow ourselves physically through those sports.

Lastly, mental sports teams like chess, Sudoku, and other mental sports, will see the same increase.

Specifically an increase of mental capacity being held by our school's students, and with this increase in mental capacity needed to play games like chess, it causes an increase in schoolwork performance, and other schoolwork related items such as tests and quizzes.

The improvement in mental and physical prowess being presented will surely produce results for my schoolmates in the future to come.

The addition of mandatory extracurricular activities to our school will prove to be a promising and progressive choice.

Firstly, students are going to able to practice unknown activities, find new passions, and find new friends while still growing themselves.

Secondly, these growing skills and hard work that will come to be expressed by both me and my schoolmates will prove beneficial not only for us, but for the school as well.

Finally, students will be able to express their mental and physical growth and increase that mental and physical growth through these extracurricular activities.

I believe without a doubt that the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities is the best decision our school has ever made.
