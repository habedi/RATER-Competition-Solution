Hello my name is Generic_Name, my principle asked me my opinion on if every kid at school should join an extracurricular activity, such as a sport, a club, or scouts. But I don't think its a good idea. Some kids might not have time for that pointless activity they might have to get home fast and do chores or care for a loved one. It might be incunvenet for there family's too they might not be able to pick their kids up from the activity. Also, Most kids would be pretty mad to we are already in school for more than six hours out of the day.

Why I think its a bad idea is a very good question. Students at school can have fun for some kids but not all kids have fun at school some kids just put their heads down hoping the bell will ring sooner than it did yesterday. I think if those kids were forced to join an extracurricular activity they would be so miserable. They would proudly try to fake sick or always go to the to the nurse hoping to go home because they might be an introvert not liking crowds or human attention. Some kids might just want to go home to their families and or their pets.

Parents might get upset as well, they might not be able to go to the school and pick their kids up. This will make the kids sad and the parents a little mad. Then, parents might have to leave work early or hire some one to go pick the kids up and take them home. It would also not benefit the school ether parents would probably call the school constantly asking them to not make their kid go to the activity today and this would probably make the school uncomfortable with all the negative attention there getting.

Students who go to that school are probably be super grumpy, tired, and annoyed. They already go to school for over six hours a day adding more onto that is going to make them tired and mad. They are most likely just sleeping and not wanting to work on anything. Since they are sleeping in school it would cause them to not sleep at night then they are tired the next day. It is a terrible cycle of sleeping in school. And there still kids let them go home and have their free time.

So all of this has been leading up to why school should let kids make their own choices. Give the kids an option if they want to join an extracurricular activity or not. Schools should accept the students choice and let the kids be kids. No matter if they want to go home and watch TV, play video games, or just play sports with there families at home. Kids should be kids.
