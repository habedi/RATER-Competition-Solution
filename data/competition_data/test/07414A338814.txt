Should students being to able to attend classes from home.? I think students shouldn't being able to attend classes from home. This is not a good benefit for students for three reasons; students can make some tricks for pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing the homeworks on online and the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online. I believe if students being able to attend online classes from home, they can make some tricks only for pass the classes on online and they will not really learn anything of the classes. however, other people say this is a good benefit because is more easy for the students take and pass the classes. I think those people are wrong because take online classes is looks like easy but it's not, this would be difficut for many students. Furthermore, some students can have trouble doing the homeworks on online because the online classes can be unsuccessful since some computer issues or the computer ruin when the student is in the middle of the half hour of the online class. some people may be think students can not have this type of problems if they buy the high price of computer mark. I think they're wrong because it doesn't matter the price mark of the computers, some times the computer just ruin for some broken tools inside of the compuers or others electronic programs and the people doesn't know about it. In addition, teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online because the teachers have to find many ways about, how they can teach the class for the students understand really well. Teachers have to learn how to make homework, how to show informations that the students need to know and other things. Some people say the teachers already know how to work on the internet and the students will understand better the teacher, but this isn't true because the teachers some times have trouble too, they need to learn many programs for making successful work and the teachers are not 100% sure that students understand the class. In conclusion, students shouln't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they're smart for making tricks for pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing the homework on online and the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online. Help students at schools would be most benefit than attend classes from home.
