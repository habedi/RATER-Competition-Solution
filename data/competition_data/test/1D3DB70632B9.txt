have you ever been bored after school not having anything to do, if you haven't then great, but if you have consider extracurricular activities. Our principal has decided that every student must do an extracurricular activity. I know that these after school programs (as they may be called) can help people, after school programs like sports, theater, and band.

sports are one of the best after school activities because they give your mind and body a workout and they help you work as a team. A lot of people play football after school and most high schools have an official football team. Football is a good one because it helps you get stronger and faster, football also teaches you how to work as a team. Baseball is another good sport that doesn't take up to much time a lot of high schools also have good official baseball teams. Baseball is a good sport to play because theres less chance of injury and it proves that you all must work together to get better. Soccer is a good sport as well it helps you get faster and you can use your brain more trying to figure out what to do. soccer is also offered by some high schools and a good way to get out and get moving. All these sports are good ways to get outdoors and to use your brains and condition your muscles.

Getting involved in theater or drama is also a good way to spend time after school. In our school we have a drama club where anyone can come and play around. Drama club is a good way to make new friends because your spending a lot of time doing fun team building exercises. with drama you can also do plays and musicals which are a good way to waste time. This year we are doing a musical, musicals like drama club are a good way to make new friends because everyone sort of comes together like a family. there are also the improv teams which are good for making friends and having fun experiences. the improv teams travel to other middle schools monthly depending on what the teacher says the improv teams give you a lot of good experiences and help you make new friends. All of these activities are good after school programs that help people advance socially and academically.

Band is also a good extracurricular activity as it provides people with another talent. Band is good because it has a lot to do, in and out of school in preparation for concerts. In order to be great the entire band has to practice in school and at home. Practicing your instrument is a good way to spend your time and it helps you academically as well. You can also make a lot of friends especially with things like band camp. Band camp starts in august and goes to the start of school for herndon high, it is a very good way to reconnect with friends or start the school year with friends for rising freshman. There's also marching band which does quite a lot and is a varsity sport. The marching band plays for the football team and does a lot of competitions in other high schools. Band also does a lot of trips and is very good for people trying to rise academically, studies show people who play instruments are smarter.

In conclusion these are all very good after school activities, and this is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many more things to do out there that you might find fun. If you want to find something but are unsure what to do, I know that sports, band, and theater are all great after school activities. While these things might not be the best for you at first glance give them a shot youd be surprised.
