Dear principal,

The policy I believe is better for our school will be policy 1. Policy 1 allows students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Being able to have this policy will be great incase of an emergency. If phones are not allowed and there is an emergency during lunch periods or other free time the student will have a hard time to try communicating his or her mother or father.

Having the policy will give a chance for students to use there phones only during lunch periods or other free time that way students won't be trying to use them during class, because it will distracted them from doing their class work.

Another reason may be students at our school will have the time to look over their messages or calls they get from their parents or another family member. This policy allows lunch periods or other free periods only. Teachers will have the rights to take phones away if seen during a class period , because the student already had the chance to use their phones in their own time. The students can only have their phones in vibration during the free time. When walking in class the phone has to be turned off, after the class time is over and it's another free period the phones can be put in vibration. This policy will help a student for any emergency with family.

The school and you as the principal should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free periods only.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
