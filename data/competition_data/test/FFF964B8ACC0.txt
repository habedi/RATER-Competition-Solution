Dear Principal,

I understand that you are debating between two policies about cell phones. One of which would make the students very happy. The other would be popular with teachers and staff. Each policy would be popular with one group, and unpopular with the other. Both policies have their pro's and con's.

Policy one would allow students to have their cell phones out between classes and during any free time they have. This would be very popular among students. They like to be able to text or call anyone and talk to them. This would make the school day more enjoyable for the pupils. On the other hand this could lead to a higher percentage of cheating. students could text their friend the answers to a test in a class the student just had. This would upset teachers because they have to focus more on cheating.

Policy two would not allow students to have their cell phones at school. This would focus students more on school work. there would be less distractions. This would also not raise the percentage of cheating. However pupils would not like this policy. They want the freedom to text or call their friends. This would make the school day less enjoyable for them.

Weighing the pro's and con's of each i decide to pick the second policy. Students don't need to text their friends in school. What kids need is a good education. They cant do that if they are texting their friend about what they are doing after school. It may not be popular with the students, but it is the smartest decision. What ever they need to say, they can wait until they seem them or are out of school. That is what I think, at least.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
