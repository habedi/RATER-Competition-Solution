Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed to keep it simple. Teacher-designed projects are usually time consuming, boring, and complicated. The summer projects should be fun, easy, and less time consuming for students. Students wouldn't want to do a project that could take up their entire summer break; they don't deserve it. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are able to decide how much time they want to spend on it and how easy or creative they want it to be.

Summer break is the time students are off from school. If they were to have teacher-designed projects, it'll make them feel like their still in school. Students are supposed to enjoy summer break, not be focused on a project given by a teacher that could stress them out. Most times, students don't do the project at all for reasons like: " Oh it's boring", " I didn't have time", " I couldn't understand it", or " It's too much work". Teacher-designed projects are not right for students, especially since it's over the summer.

Student-designed projects will allow students to have an enjoyable summer. If they create their own project, they have control on what they do. Students will still be learning by themselves with what they decide to create. If the student does not want to spend the whole summer working on the project, it will be okay because they're the one making the decisions. The students can make their project easy and fun with things like: Colors, Pictures, and Glitter. Students will be able to enjoy their summer break because their project will be fun and easy for them.

Everyone has their own opinion for these two choices. If it were to be discussed by teachers only, they would most likely choose teacher-designed projects. If it were to be discussed by students only, they would most definitely choose students-designed projects. Between teachers and students discussing it, it would basically be a 50/50, but the teachers should really give students the chance to create something and learn on their own. It's best for the summer projects to be students-designed to have it easy on them.
