I think we should have technology to read students emotional expressions. we could use this for classes when we are doing homework and we dont understand so the teacher could help."can we actually "calculate" emotions -like math homework. If they could use it i think it would be better.

If we use this technology we could see if someone was hiding there emotions. If we used it we could help peoplethat need help. we could see if they are scared or confused or even angry. I would want to know if someone was mad so i wouldn't say something to them and make hem upset.

we could use this in paintings we could see what emotions they have. In this article they said Mona Lisa is 83% happy 9% disgusted 6% fearful 2% angry. I think it would help artist to make sure they look a surton emotion. I think we should have technology to read students emotional expressions because we could use this to do homework and teachers understand if we get the homework.
