"Cell Phones ! What's the big deal everyone has them and uses them so might as well just let us use it !" . You have probably herd this a lot. Well what do you think ? I can tell you that , You think that they are really bad because they are the number one distractions and without them your students will do better. Well in part you are right and I agree but is it all really the cell phones fault? Think about it , cell phones aren't the only reason or distractions and you know that. Do you think parents let these kids have them so they can get in trouble and it will make them do bad in school with lower grades ? Well i am pretty sure you have kids and let me give you an example why we need our phones .

For instance there is a major earth quake, if your child has a cell phone what is the first thing their parents will do ? Better yet what would you do ? Of course eventually you want to know how your child is and cell phones are the only way to get to them. That's just one of many I can think of. But yet again I know the major risk that you will take in letting them use it at school but either way in 5 or 10 years from now I bet that cell phones will be allowed .

Life is made with tough decisions even if I'm trying to persuade you it is your decision but i want you to see other reasons phones are good and not just bad. Even though I know most people use it at wrong times. After all not all parents just spoil their kids so they can have fun all the time . They bought them for a reason . And you have to understand that sometimes its a must to call your parents. There are certain situations that kids aren't just going to go to teachers or principals that's why we have our lovely parents . So I hope you understand and make a good decision .
