Do you ever get bored at home after school? Also, Do you wish you had the opportunity to meet more people? Then you could benefit from doing a extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal deciding all students must participate in a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision because there is a wide range of activities, there should be at least one activity that will fit a students personality, and it will get students involved with the school.

First off, there is a wide range of activities that should fit all students. For instance, the activates are accessible. there are many activities. Therefore, at least on activity should fit into the students schedule. They are accessible because of the range of activities, at least one activity should fit with your child's personality. With such a wide range of activities there are endless possibilities.

Another reason I agree with the principal deciding students must participate in a extracurricular activity is because it can help students be more social. For example extracurricular activities can help students make new friends. When I did a extracurricular activity at school in elementary school I met my best friend Allison, who I am still friends with today. Along with, extracurricular activities being able to help students make new friends, extracurricular activities can also help develop teamwork skills. In the movie

Moana , Moana and Maui started off not liking each other at all, but after working together for a while they became best friends. Another example is, students can get to know the staff of the school better. Staff members can share there none school related activities they enjoy doing to students. As you can see, doing extra curricular activities can help you meet some of your closest friends.

Finally, students can be more involved with the school when they participate in extracurricular activities. One reason students can be more involved in school is, they can help the school. When students pay to do the extracurricular actives they can help the school have better resources. Schools will be able to buy supplies and help repair and damage to the school that may occur with the money coming from extracurricular activities. Also, there will be education opportunities. The students will be able to communicate among themselves and share ways to improve there daily school experience. Lastly, students will be able to make school a more enjoyable place. For example the art club could paint murals around the school bringing a happier environment. Can you imagine how great place school would be if everyone pitched in?
