I do not agree with this, if students were required to take an extracurricular it may not work for everyone. Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.

Extracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to. The student may feel the need to attend every single meeting which may also cause stress or anxiety. There are two more reasons that an extracurricular activity should not be required.

Students may not like any extracurricular activity that was offered. There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list. If the student does not like any extracurricular activity they should not be forced into one. Forcing a student into an activity they do not want to do could be stressful on them or result in a violent reaction. There is a final reason why extracurricular activities should not be required.

Students may not have the time for an extracurricular activity if it is after school. Some students have things going on as soon as they get home, it could be another sport that is not in school or just going out after school. A lot of people usually don't have time for an activity that is after school if they are already in a sport that is not at the school. This could also result in not getting homework done or getting bad grades. The extracurricular activity could easily get in the way of these things a students has to do.

If a extracurricular activity was needed I do not think it should be mandatory. It could cause any of the listed things; stress and anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. I personally think these are valid reason not to require extracurricular activities.
