Dear Principal,

I think that you should have students be able to bring their cell phones into school. I believe that this would allow students to be trustworthy and always safe. If you choose policy two then you will not allow students to have cell phones during school. This isn't a good idea because if a student gets hurt or his teacher gets hurt, hew can just call for help and not have to run all the way down to the office.

I think that you should choose policy one because students would have to be trusted to bring their phone into school and have it turned off. They would have to be trusted to do this. Maybe you could make some kind of punishment to the students that don't do this. If you are going to make a punishment don't make it so everyone is punished make it so that only the student that was caught with his phone on during class would be punished. Make them go to a detention or suspend them from school. Don't punish the students that are following the policy because they were following the rules.

I really like that they can use their phone during lunch. I think this is a lovely reward for having their phone turned off during classes. They can play games, text friends, and get new numbers from friends they have recently met. I think that the students would be more social, and be more active.

Another point is that students need a break during the day. From a personal experience, school can be a long and boring day sometime. A little break during the lunch period will allow kids to not focus on school for 30 minutes. It allows them to relieve some stress and get some things off of their mind. Everyone needs a break, even adults. When the adult workers go on their lunch break they text and call friends and family. I students should be able to as well. I believe that students need a break for these reasons.

These are the reasons that I believe students should be allowed to bring their phones into school but have them off during class time. I love the idea of having to be able to use the phone during lunch. I think it would be a very food idea for you to allow policy number one to take affect immediately.

From you student,
