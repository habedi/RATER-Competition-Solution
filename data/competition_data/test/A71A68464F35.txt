Hello, I am a scientist from NASA. I was asked about the aliens on Mars. I must say that the first picture in 1976 looks a lot like an alien, but we have gotten better technology and the newest pictures show it is just a monument. It resembles the butte or mesa landforms in the American West. They are naturally formed in nature. As my colleague said in his text they resemble eachother enormously. Also, we used the absolute maximum resolution in the latest picture we took in 2001. It was made very apparent that this was not aliens at work but again just a natural landform. The only reason that people aren't believing the truth with our technology is because these conspiracy theorists. Finally, the biggest piece of evidence that the face is a natural landform is that if NASA discovered this, we would benefit tremendously. We are not hiding this from anyone. We here at NASA would get more money, funding, and attention. We mainly would want the funding to perhaps interact with the aliens if they were there, but they are not. So that is why I, a scientist at NASA, can confirm that the picture from 1976 is just a bad picture of a natural landform. Also, I can confirm that we here at NASA aren't hiding the truth from you. If there is ever aliens we will make sure to tell you, the people, first.
