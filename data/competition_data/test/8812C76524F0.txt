Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this letter to inform you that students should have a Grade B average to be able to compete in sports. It would be better for them to do so because if they miss a day they wouldn't be so far behind.

First I would make some of the kids miss some of there practices and stay for tutoring.

I would make sure that they stayed for tutoring and there grades were going up to a B point average. I would contact there parents and tell them that there child had to have a B point average before playing sports.

Second I would let them go to some of there practices if there grades were improving.

I would tell the student to do better in school and not act up so much. I would stay in contact wit the student until he or she was doing better. I hope that the student does better.

Finally, I would make sure the student was doing a lot better and tell him he didn't have to stay for tutoring anymore. I would let him start going back to his practices and be more careful in school and pay more attention. If his grade started to back down he would have to stay for tutoring and not go to many practices.

I hope you like my idea of making the student having the B point average.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
