Dear principal,

I would have to disagree on having to have a grade point average of a B to be in any activities. Why I think this is ,some student might be great student and just have a grade C average . Another reason is some students might have just messed up on a quiz and that lowered the grade , but tried really hard to pass but just couldn't. Also why you shouldn't change the grade point average is most of these activities help use learn about important thing.

Some examples would be sports help you be a good sport even though you lose ,or just to stay with it and don't quit. Some other program help out with being helpful to the community. Also from making life threatening chooses .A grade point average of a C is not bad you are still passing the grade, and maybe they might not be that strong in that subject. Inconclution , if you took the privileges from us and having to have a grade point average for a B then that would be keeping are fun activities away from us .

from, student
