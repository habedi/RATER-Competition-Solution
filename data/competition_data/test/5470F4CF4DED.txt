Teacher Designed Summer Projects

Summer finally comes to an end and all students have completed their student designed summer project. Students are one month into school and realize the summer projects they created has not helped them prepare for school. Students are put into a horrible scenario, where they are mentally not prepared for school and are assigned many assignments they cant keep up with. It is a teachers job to create projects, tests, and assignments to help further improve a students ability to learn and understand the subject.

Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers are familiar with the format, would prepare students for school, and students are inexperienced project designers.

Many people disagree with the idea of having a teacher design a summer project for students. The opposing side believes that students should create summer projects because students would feel familiar with the format and would feel stress free. What critics fail to consider is students have never created a summer project before and would be stressed when school starts, due to creating a bad project. Teachers have always been the people that create the summer projects, so they are more familiar with creating a great project design. Teachers are great at preparing students for school and upcoming challenges. Students may stress a little over the summer, but the teacher designed projects would help students be prepared for the school year and cause less stress. Teachers are known to help students and would try their best to help students ready for the next year.

Teachers have created assignments and projects for years.

Teachers are very familiar with the format of creating a summer project due to the previous years. A teacher would know what information to put for the students whether if its easy or hard. For example, a teacher could make a project based on review and information learned from the previous year. Teachers can make the project familiar to the students based on recent studies or similar assignments they have made during the year. Students would then be more understanding of the project and remember the information they have been taught. Students would then have to actively use their brain to remember information and how to complete the project due to previous assignments. Teachers are good at spreading out the variety of information on a assignment, so students can learn and remember more than one unit. For instance, teachers can eliminate the repetition of a unit/subject that can possibly be put, and have a variety of information. Teachers would help students remember information taught throughout the year and let them be able to solve it in the project. The repetition of a subject could be created by a student if they designed their own project. Teachers are used to creating assignments and due to the many years of creating summer projects, it would be perfect for teachers, due to them being familiar with the format.

Teachers are very good at helping students get ready for the upcoming tests, by giving students the necessary information needed. By letting teachers design summer projects for students, it would allow them to prepare students for the next school year. To explain this, teachers would give a certain amount of questions for students to complete, so students can continue to learn and use their brain power through break. As students advance in their school years, they would start to receive more assignments and projects. By allowing teachers to design summer projects, they can help prepare students for that certain situation, by giving students a little more work or questions then students think they would receive. Teachers could make projects a little more advanced by giving students a more challenging or different format, to prepare them for the upcoming school year. To demonstrate this, teachers can give students a research project, so students would have to use both their brains and online websites to find their information. This prepares students for the school year, by challenging them to actually focus on their projects and be more familiar on how their future assignments would look like.

If teachers create summer projects, it would help students be more prepared and less stressed for the upcoming new school year.

Teachers have always been the ones to create assignments, because it's their jobs. If a students created a summer project, they would poorly design it, due to their lack of experience. Students would not know how to exactly format the projects. To demonstrate this, students can create a project that doesn't meet requirements for a student to learn and work on. It would be hard for a group of students to decide on how to make their projects, because they are not taught to create projects. Students aren't as skilled as teachers to design a perfect format for all students to complete during the summer. Many students like to enjoy their summer without school projects, because they think projects are a lot of work, or very hard. If students have the power to create a summer project, they would poorly design it, for it to be easier. To clarify, students would make the questions or requirements to complete the projects very easy. Students would not create a challenging project for other students to complete. This can poorly prepare students for the next school year, which can leave students very stressed.

The arguable statement on whether if students or teachers should create summer projects is clearly obvious. Teachers should create summer projects because teachers have experience, can help students better prepare for school, and students have no experience of formatting a project. Teachers have a great impact on helping students ready for school. A petition must be signed by teachers and schools to allow teachers to continue to create summer projects.
