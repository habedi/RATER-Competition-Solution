Dear Mrs. Principal,

I believe that you should allow the students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free periods as long as they are off during class. I believe this should be the policy our school has because during free periods and lunch phones do not disrupt anything they just keep kids occupied. The kids might also need to use their phones to call parents to organize pickups and drop offs. If you have a serious enough punishment for having phones on during class then kids will be afraid of using their phones. I believe you should allow students to use phones during free periods and lunch as long as they are off during classes.

During free periods it does not matter if students use phones because they are not usually doing anything educational. Phones could actually keep them occupied from doing things like vandalizing. During free periods students often find themselves not doing anything, and when students are bored they sometimes make trouble. Students might actually need to use phones to organize pickups and drop offs with parents.

If you make a serious punishment like detention for having phones on in class students would most-likely think the risk of getting caught is to great. They will also probably think it is not worth it to read the one text that they got since they last checked. What is the point of not letting student use phones during free periods, they are not doing anything anyway!

Not letting students bring phones to school is not a good idea. It is better that students use their phones than go and vandalize the bathroom! If there is a punishment for using phones then student will not want to risk looking at their phones. I think you should allow students to bring phones to school if they don't use them during class.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
