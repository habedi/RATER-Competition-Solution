What if a computer could read your emotion?

In the University of Illinois, and the Univrsiy of Amsterdam Dr. huang and his colleague are experts at developing better way for humans and computuers to cummunicate.

This technology would alos benfite us in classrooms.

Making computers smarter and faster is more usefull.

The new technology would get more students involved with class and work aswell.

This technology would help students interact with clss work, and or school projects.

The way it would make students interact more is, when they are using a computer or a type of technology.

The device would read ther eemotion, if they get bored it would change into somthing fun and that wikll get them back on task.

A quote to support my claim is " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, liken an effective human instructor".

The quote expains that the computer can read the emotion of a student if hes getting bored or confused, the computer can read it and change it to somthing else.

This technology could also help play video games or video surgery.

Another way this type of technology would be helpful, it could get people to do there task faster.

If we could get technology at the same rate of what us humans are capable of, life would much easier. A quote to support my second main topic " In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation"

every day.

For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face".

This quote explains of how us as humans can recongize what feeling, in our face expression looks like.

Another reason why this technology would help us is it would be able to make a 3-D model of past pictures to find out what there emtions were at the moment.

A quote to support my third and final claim " She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent digusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No, that's not your science teacher, grading your lastest lab assignment.

It's the subject of leonrdio da Vinci's Renaissance painrio=ng, Mona Lisa".

This quote explains on how a 100+ year old portat can be simpled down and 3-D printed to show what the emtions of the Mona Lisa's were when the picture eas drew.

The overall look of this essay is that whether to use this technology or not.

This technology is very usefel and perfect for school.

This technology is good for doctors or sicentist to figure out other stuff.

This type of technology can go back into time and figure out what the emtions were, of whoever was in th picture.

The type of technology is usefull and smart.
