Have you ever had to do summer projects during summer break? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects.

Some people say summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would help them practice for topics that would be discussed the next school year. However, summer projects should be student-designed because students could be more creative with what they do. For example, when a teacher assigns you a project the set their projects to be something specific like: show a graph, create a drawing of this, and/or write a essay about this. When there are limited options like this, students that struggle at something like drawing could be put at a disadvantage and not grade as high as other students. Thats why if summer projects are student-designed students would be able to show off the talents they have and be more creative with what they present as their summer project.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because student can go at their own pace. For example, some projects could require students to do something that they dont understand and therefore they wouldn't be able to complete their project. However, if summer projects would be student-designed the students would be able to complete the project because they could do something that they know how to do and its at their own learning pace and they could also help teacher know what a student struggles at and what they know really well.

Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do complete their project. For example, one of the reasons many student don't complete their projects is because they think that the projects are too boring or are too hard. However, if the students get to choose what they are going to turn in as their summer project then they would do projects that they think are fun or aren't too hard and many more students would turn in their projects.

In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects. For these reasons, I implore teachers to allow summer projects to be student-designed.
