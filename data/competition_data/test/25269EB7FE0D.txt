Dear Principle,

I believe that all students should be given the privilege of being able to use their phones during lunch. As long as we do not use them during the day and turned them off it would be no distraction the class or the teacher trying to teach it. This should be a good policy because it would not be distracting, it is a good way of talking to our friends, and it would get rid of the need to move table to table to talk to all of your friends.

Cell phones would not be distracting during lunch because the lunch room is loud enough as it is, it would not disturb anyone. You cannot distract anyone lunch because they are talking to their own friends and not paying attention to anyone else.

Furthermore, the only thing to do at lunch is eat and socialize with your friends and that what you would be doing when texting. It is the same thing.

Furthermore, cell phones should be allowed at lunch because it is a more efficient and convenient way of talking to our friends. This would decrease the unnecessary yelling and overall loudness of the room. Therefore, making it easier on the staff, lunch ladies, and student.

Lastly, cell phones would be a good thing for us and everyone during lunch. because it would get rid of having to go back and forth from tables to talk with your peers. Most lunch staff find this annoying for reasons i do not know, but if we were capable of texting each other we would have no reason or excuse to do this.

Cell phones during the day would be a serious distraction to everyone in a learning environment because of the ringing, buzzing, and irritating sound of your fingers typing in words. However, it would benefit everyone if we had access to our phone during our free period of time. In conclusion we should have the right to use our cell phones during lunch.
