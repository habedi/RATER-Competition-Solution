Senator of Florida, the electoral college should continue and not change. The electoral college has helped America vote evenly on politics. This helps avoid any conflicts with candidates. Without the electoral college, we would have to try and use a new method. Using a new method is not only time consuming but, nobody is sure it can have a certain outcome.

The electoral college dismisses the problem of run-off elections. Candidates wouldn't have to worry about not receiving a majority vote. "For example, Nixon in 1968 and Cliton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)." (Posner, 22)

Using the electoral college will give you certanity of the outcome. Since most states go off a certain basis, it is very likely that the state will have a win based on their electoral votes. "In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state." (Posner, 18)

Conversly, it can lead to another disaster. People do have the possibility of rearranging votes so a certain candidate wins. "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)" (Plumer, 11)

Although there were problems and disasters in the past, we have grown from them. Electoral College gives us certainty. This avoids run-off elections as well. Keeping the electoral college would maintain the political balance in America.
