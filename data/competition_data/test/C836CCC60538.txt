It would be dangerous to go to venus it would take courage to go somewhere you never seen or been there before. Nasa wants to send humans to study venus it will be dangerous to go to venus but its worth the try to see if its good like weather and to see if there oxygen. venus is like Earth twin they are really close to each other but venus density and size are occasionally bigger.

Venus has over ninety seven percent of carbon dioxide. Whats more challening is that there are more clouds than earth. the temperatures can also be very dangerous up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 greater then normal earth averrage.

Nasa is working on aproaches to studying venus. Nasa tested some electronics made of silicon carbide and only lasted about three weeks they want to improve that and make better electronics or even better so the heat of any kind of phone or tablet resist the pressure of heat and other forces.
