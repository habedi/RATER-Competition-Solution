Dear Principle,

Personally, I believe that students should be performing some sort of community service. Everyone needs to be doing there part in helping out with their towns, schools, and neighbors. Community service doesn't have to hard and time consuming, it can be as simple as picking up a piece of trash on playground.

Community service is a very important part of society, and development. Most people would agree. I'm sure everyone wants the youth to grow up into smart, kind, caring individuals- don't we? Yes we do. If no one does community service how is anyone supposed to learn any of it? Also, without community service the environment wouldn't be as clean in most communities, and that's because people help pick up garbage. I sure don't want to be living in dirty town. Do you?

In another scenario, what if parents cant watch there children when they get out of school. The kids, and the adults are stuck. Kids cant be alone, and adults cant miss work. So there in a bit of a pickle. That's when community service comes into play- again. No surprise there, if you ask me. Babysitters are your answer.

I guess all I'm trying to say is that community service is a very important thing to be doing. Its not only important for society, and others. But it can be very rewarding, and it looks good when applying for jobs in the future. In my eyes, everyone should be giving a little bit of there time to help others, and give back to there community, and in essence to help themselves in the long run. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
