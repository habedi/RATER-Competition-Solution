Yes, there is a Face on Mars and some people say The Face was created by aliens, but that statement is not true aliens did not created The Face. In fact it is just a natural landform. This landform was actually a lava dome that just got shaped funny when the lava got hard enough to stay the same for the rest of time, unless something happened really bad on Mars. We can state the fact that aliens did not build The Face because we have used the best camera and seen that there is no evindence that aliens build The Face. It is just like something we would see on earth it just happened naturally like how the Grand Canyon got on earth no human or alien built the Grand Canyon. It is just a natural thing that had happened just like The Face on Mars. In the picture that

NASA took has been zoomed into and the zoom would have picked up anything that was on the ground and there was not anything that showed that aliens or anything had build The Face there was absolutly nothing around the face that the aliens could have even used to build The Face out of. Therefore The Face was in fact not build by aliens. The Face is just a natural appering thing on Mars and there is no sign of anyone or anything building The Face on Mars excepcially not aliens.
