Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Most kids never consider a life outside of their own, most believe that if they see something on T.V. that it's just another show, they may understand it may be true but they don't feel the same pain or hurt as the crying mother on the flickering screen before them. All students should be required to do at least 10 hours of community service every quarter. Think of how much a difference it would make, if everyone worked together.

Most people argue it's not technically community service if the deed is not by their own will, but does it have to be? All I am asking is that students help with their community so they can understand the world doesn't just revolve around them. The basic concept of helping out at a local nursing home or picking up trash on a free way is a great thing! Sure it's time consuming, I won't argue with that, but it will also help students to manage their time to fit in school, athletics, and time for others.

But some kids already know what it feels like, to be in a situation like that woman in pain the rich kids down the street see on T.V. They can feel that deep in their hearts. People less fortunate shouldn't be the only ones working hard to survive, others should too so they don't think everyone's life is easy. All the brats who piggyback off of their parents never learn that feel of satisfaction that comes from helping others. If children have this sort of activity worked into their everyday schedule they can become more generous people when they're older.

I, myself, have done community service in the past and learned to give and receive happiness in return. When you ask a man in withered, old, yellow rain coat sitting on a street corner his name, his story, instead of looking past him and hoping you'll never have to look him in the eye, sit down, shut up, and listen to what he's got to say. You might be surprised and that's what I think kids in my grade should learn to do. Not from some second step program about bullying, they're our bigger problems in our world that this generation has to come to terms with. Therefore I think it should be mandatory for every student to have to do 10 hours of community service every quarter.
