Dear Principal,

I strongly believe all students should be required to perform community service because we should help out our town or city in any way we can. We should help clean up and make the town at the least look nice for visitors or to neighboring towns. It's like cleaning your room before an event or party to have it look nice to the people that come. Would you rather have people criticising people on your town or telling people how nice it is? And if you have a messy or run down town you wont attract anybody to your town. Even the kids would say it is nice to have a bunch of friends to hang out with, and with a run down town there wont be many people there to be with. So it will be better for everyone in the town in the long run even if the kids don't like it. You have about 70-90 years of life and the least you could do is spend a few hours helping out your town.

You could plant flowers or trees near a school to make it look nice, or help build a community park for everyone to see. And if you have a ton of people helping out then it wont take as long as only having a couple people help out. And who want s to represent a town that no one likes?

If you don't clean up your town and garbage and other junk like it accumulate then it can start to affect much larger things than just your town, maybe even the world! Sometimes community service can even be fun. This is why I believe all students should be required to do community service.
