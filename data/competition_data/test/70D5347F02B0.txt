Dear Principal,

I you should let us(kids) use our cell phones during because i think the student will be good. Another reason we should use our cell phones is during lunch is because we can text during lunch so we don't have to wait after school to text our friends because during lunch we can text our friends and if we need 2 text our mom just in cast we forget our homework we can text mom to bring the homework for us before we can get an 0 % on homework.

We can use our cell phones to take picture of what our homework should be on and we can send the to the kids that are not in school so they can do homework in trne there homework in with out teacher telling them they got to do for homework. So let us use our cell phones for this reason, you should be kind to lets us use phones in school please! So what do you said about we use our phones. I think you would be the best principal. And that would help us in school. But we will keep our cell phones turned off during classes.
