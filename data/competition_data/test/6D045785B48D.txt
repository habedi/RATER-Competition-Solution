Dear Principle,

I am displeased to inform you that most children do not seek out community service projects on their own because they feel they won't have as much time for their activity's. I feel that you, the principle should require each student to perform community service once a month. You may be fought along the way by your numerous students who disagree with me, but I'm sure you agree that community service is only a good thing.

A community is like a big machine. It needs to be taken care of, and we all need to do our part. Without community service there would be trash on the ground, elderly citizens in need of help, and families that are starving. Why not take the small amount of time out of our lives to help so many? Not only is a beneficial for the community, but also for the people in more ways then one. It helps get us into collage, show compassion and love for our home, and it helps us give back to a community that takes care of us. These kids don't need to do it alone either, in fact you should encourage them to bring their friends and make it a fun time! There is so much we can all do.

My mother works in a retirement home, She often gets volunteers in the 20-50 age range when really there should be more kids between the ages of 13-19. Child interaction with the elderly has proven to make them feel more alive and healthy- more active. A retirement home is a great place to volunteer, but there are so many different places you could help! An Animal shelter, a local store, school or park picking up trash and cleaning. You could plant trees and do gardening, the possibility's are endless!

I strongly suggest you require students to do monthly community service. Its so wonderful to help your community and make things flourish. Maybe you could help with the community service too? Just to show the kids that you care enough to try yourself. Community service is the way to go. Thank you for you time.

Sincerely,
