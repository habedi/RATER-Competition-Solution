I think that this Facial Action Coding System will be benefitial to the classroom. Most parts of the day we spend on our computpers reading articles, typing papers, or searching for information. I think that if the computer could read our facial expression, it would help teachers know what way of learning works best for students. Your teacher can't always tell if you don't understand something or if your having a rough day. If the computer can, I think that it would help teachers help students.

When I read an article online for a project I usually get bored from it. If a computer can tell by my face that I am bored it could change the lession plan to have me play a game or vistit a different website that might be more hands on. The computer would be able to reconize the main 44 muscles in the face to determine the persons emotion, and from that it would know what to do next. The computer is a tool we are constantly using to help benefit us. This would help benefit teachers. For example if an ad popped up on your screen and you laugh or smile the computer will know you enjoyed it and show you more things like that, but of you frown or have a look of discust it will know that it needs to chnage the plan of your study path.

In conclustion I think that Facial Action Coding System would be a good idea for our school. I think it will be a good way of learning. This could also help out teachers being able to know if kids understand. I also think that it will be a good perspective to have for teachers and students. Not all people can read emotion so if a computer did it for us it would be easier to know who needs help and how they learn best.
