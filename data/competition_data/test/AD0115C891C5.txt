I just graduated from high school , my name is Luke Bomberger.

I work two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. My best friend works with me , his name is Don Reist. I was working when Don invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Why wouldn't I say yes , I mean it's a lifetime thing so why not go? World War I I

Was over in Europe many countries wear left ruined or tone apart.

Many animals where stuck with no home or food. The animals had no one , nobody feeder them. UNRRA hired ''seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the young cows , horses , and mules

That got shipped over sea. Once Don and I heard about UNRRA we wanted to sign up , so we did. We really need more ''Seagoing Cowboys''. The amazing thing about working and helping these animals is seeing the happiness on there face.

Come join Don and I , I'm telling you it is very joyful.

You would get to travel on the boat maybe even see some

Tourist , or maybe you would be able to see the places we are going. Don and I have made some trips to Greece , castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

It would be a great , you would travel around the world seeing some amazing places , while helping animals and seeing the joy on there face. Who wouldn't want to be helping in the UNRRA.

Join now for a once and a lifetime chance!
