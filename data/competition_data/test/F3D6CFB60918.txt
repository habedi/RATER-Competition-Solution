Not all students are meant to be in a classroom, some students work way better in a place that is familair to them, like their home.Â Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it could help some to focus better and make them feel more comfortable in their surroundings. Offering distance learning as an option for studets to attend class while not being physically in school is a wonderful idea. By having the option of going to school from home, students are not trapped or required to participate in a classroom environment, yet they are still getting an education. Every student learns a bit differently, so to not have the option of distance learning available to every student is ignorant and exclsusive.

Many students suffer from learning dissabilites such as ADHD or dyslexia, which can make it very hard to focus in a classroom environment. Students with these dissabilities have a very hard time paying attention when distractions are amonst them. Classrooms can get very loud and crowded, which can easily cause distraction for anyone, much less students with certain learning dissabilities. At home, students with learning dissablilities would be more likely to succeed because it is a controlled environment; however, classrooms in schools are quite the opposite of controlled. This is why having the option of distance learning would strongly benefit many students who desprately need a quiet and familair space to study and learn in.

Another situation that could benefit from being able to attend class from home would be disabled students. Hallways in schools can get extremely crowded and overwhelming, so if a student is in a wheelchair it might be difficult to be in that sort of environment. It could be hard to thrive in a classroom environment when not all parts of your body can function. For example, if you are missing a limb or are paralyzed, it might be more comfortable to stay at home, where there is easy access to everything the student needs. In a similar situation, if a sudent has a severe mental diability that renders them immobile, they could get anxious in crowded spaces where it is even more difficult to get around. In these situations, distance learning would be necessary to at least offer as an option.

While I can understand the arguement that a classroom environment is a necessary part of life to develop social and critical thinking skills, it is critical to understand that not all students learn the same way. It is beneficial to have good social and thinking skills, which are taught immensly in school; however, it is not always going to be possible that every student can develop such skills in a loud and crowded envirnment. Just because physically being in a classroom is the most common way of deveoping relationships or getting an education, doesn't mean it will be the most ideal way of doing so for every student. It is very possible that students can learn social skills and get a great education right from the comfort of their home. A classroom is not necessary for such skills, it is just more well-known and socially accepted.

Overall, while a school environment is great for most students, it will not be beneficial to all students. The option of being able to attend classes from home is extremely important and would be very helpful to the rare cases of students who are unable to thrive in a school surrounding. Learning dissabilities or physical restrictments are not as common, but that doesn't mean that they don't exist. In such situations, being able to attend class online or through video confrencing would be the most beneficial way for students to get the most out of the education they're given and be the most comfortable while doing so.
