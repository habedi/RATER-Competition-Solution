The use of the Facial Action Coding system is not beneficial for students in a classroom, because it shouldn't matter how they are feeling as long as they are learning something, facial action coding system doesn't have anything to do with kid's learning or what they are doing in a classroom, and it doesn't benefit them in any type of way.

It shouldn't matter how kids are feeling in a classroom, because they are there for education not for people to judge how they look between angry, happy, disgusted etc. Kid's go to classrooms to learn, to be taught something, to make something of themselves. Yes, at the top of paragraph one it talks about how Prof. Thoman Huang was able to tell that Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. They did all that with a painting not in a classroom, this technology could be beneficial if it was showing the emotions of paintings and what they felt when they were getting a portrait of themselves.

Facial Action Coding has nothing to do with kid's learning, because its not teaching them anything. If anything its teaching them to not be angry or not be disgusted but to be happy. In this article they are only talking about the Monal Lisa which she was around at one point but now she is not. Kid's learning is not based off of the fact that they are able to do some Facial Coding and see how their friends feel or how their family feels. Kid's are in classrooms to learn about one subject and one subject only, kids shouldn't have to sit there and see how they are feeling through a 3D programing, they should already know how they feel. In Paragraph 5 it says " most of us would have troubel actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worrid, disgusted etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles percisely enough to convey specifici emotions." Nowhere in this passage does it talk about it being beneficial or them using it in classrooms.

It doesnt benefit kid's learning in any type of way the only way it does benefit them is by the coding, they could learn coding and get a good job with that. In paragraph 7 it is giving you tips on how to smile when infront of a mirror, so even if kids did learn how to do facial action coding it wouldn't mean anything for their future. Yea they get to tell by looking at a 3D model of the muscles in the face and they get to see what percentage of happy, sad disgusted, etc. Kids do not have to have a Facial Action Coding system that enable computers to identify human emotions because, kids can easily talk to some people for a good amount of time, and they can tell that in their voice in their actions everything they do they can tell if they are happy, sad, annoyed, angry, disgusted etc. Facial Action Codes do not benefit a kid's learning in a classroom at all. In paragraph 6 it talks about how the Mona Lisa demonstrations is really intended to bring a smile to your face,and it shows just how much a computer can do, a computer could read Mona Lisa's face which is a paint and its not moving, but with a human it would be hard to because they are always moving, the muscles in their body are always moving, they could be happy one minute and be angry the next, so kids wouldn't know which one they are because the muscle's in you face are constantly moving.

No, Facial Action coding is not beneficial for students in a classroom, because it shouldn't matter hwo they are feeling as long as they are learning something, facial action coding system doesn't have anything to do with kid's learning or what they are doing in a classroom, and it doesn't benefit them in a classroom in any type of way
