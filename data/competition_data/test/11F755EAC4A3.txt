The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", brings the reader to light on the argument on whether or not scientist should keep trying land spacecrafts or humans on Venus.

An arguement can be made for either side and is just a matter of opionion.

The author conveys her opionion well in the passages, but she doesn't make a compelling case for her side of the argument. The author doesn't give enough reasonable support to back up her claims.

To begin with, the amount of danger that is on Venus's surface and atmosphere poses too big of a challenge for scientists to reasonably accomplish. As it says in the passage, Venus is converes in almost 97% carbon dioxide and the temperature and pressure arounf 90 times greater than what we usually experience on Earth, making Venus's surface temperature around 800 degree. If anyone probes that touchdown on Venus don't get destoyed by any of those, there's a likely chance it'll get destroyed by its frequent lighting storms, earthquakes and volcanoes.

The author claim to the soultion to these challenges are also highly unrealistic. The author states that humans can explore Venus by contructing a vehicle that hovers 30+ miles above the surface. The author gives this solution but doesn't give any support to how it will be accomplished and doesn't give answer to questions like, "How will they transport a blimp to Mars?", " How they enter Mars atmophere without landing first?" or "What will power this?" (If it's constantly in the air that will takeup a lot of fuel.)

One last backset to the author's plan is, how will it be funded? The bills will start racking up everytime a probe is destroyed by Venus's surface and they have to spend millions of more dollars building and sending another spacecraft to Venus. No countries or companies want to spend billions of dollars on a mission that they mat have a chancce of lerning some information about Mars.

The author goals and solutions are just too unrealistics with this day and age's technologies. It is advanced but not advanced to overcome the obsticals that Vensus present. Some day in the future we may be advance enough to achieve this goal.
