Dear Principle,

I think that your idea for people who have at least a B average to be in activities is really not the greatest idea you could do for us. I will give three reasons for being against this idea.

I don't have a B average and am in band and I love it but if you take it away from me and my other band friends we will really be upset. I think that people should be in activities even if they don't have at least a B average. Everyone loves doing activities even if their grades are down, it makes school even more fun then it already is. If you take it away from us kids, we wont like school anymore.

People would go to school and look forward to the fun activities that are in place for them. I even know some people who are failing classes and do sports. I think you should do at least a C average or even a

D average for some students but don't ruin our school lives. When parents hear about this their children will be depressed and beg them to tell you to put activities back at school. Parents will help their child put their grade up but what happens if the student is struggling? Depression will hit them if that child does sports and doesn't get to play if they fail one single class.

Everyone doesn't like going to a boring school with no after school activities just because of their C average and all their other friends get all the fun. If you passed this I would get kicked out of band because of this. Don't so this to us students. Some of us are the best acting students and could be your best yet. You wouldn't be here without us. We don't deserve this at all. I hope you change your mind if you do pass this.

Your student,
