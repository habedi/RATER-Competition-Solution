Some many people are voting for students to not attend to school,but instead they should be getting a video conference online from a teacher to their house that way they don't have to attend to school and just stay at home.

This could bring some benefits to students in all the country.

One of the main reason why students have bad grades in school is the distraction. In all my classes there is a group of students that doesn't care about learning in class, they will always be talking loud and distracting everyone in the classroom for example when I'm in my science class I would always be get distracted by a group of students who are talking loud and distracting other people. My teacher would always call the principal and not teach anything,so we don't really learn anything. Because all the time that he waste for those kids we were just listen and watching all that was happening at that time. But if I had a video conference I would not be distracted by nobody and I would not be wasting my time because I would be learning and not bein distracted by other people.

If some students could attend to class by getting a video cofference they would not be warry about the weather conditions. For example my little brother always has to walk to school at 7 am, sometimes when he is on his way to school he can't breath because the temperature are too low, so my mom has to drive him or pay for someone who could leave him at school. So because of that when the temperature are to low he doesn't go to school so when he goes back he has to do all the work that he miss when he wasn't there and all the homework that he miss. But if he could asist to class online he would not be missing any classwork or any homework from school and most important he would not be sick and my mom doesn't has to worry about who can drive him to school.

In my opinion who really doesn't have to attend to school is the students who have any disability. This could be a big benift for those students because I know how hard is to not be available to walk or do something else. In my opinion this could help them so much because they would have to switch from a classroom to another one, and they would not have to travel to those full hallways in school.

Those are some examples why I agree that some students should receive the opportunity to attend to class by a video conference and why the country should accept that not all students can be at school.
