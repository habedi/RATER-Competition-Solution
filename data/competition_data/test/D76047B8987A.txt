Have you ever wanted to go see Paris for free and still help people in need? Well, now you can by just volunteering and becoming a seagoing cowboy. So here are some advantages of becoming a seagoing cowboy.

First of all, you can get some character by volunteering and helping out. So when you are a sea cowboy you have to do work all the time so you are busy so then if you have to you can learn how to clean, feed, and water animals on a farm.

Another thing is that you can help people and make someone happy. Don't you just love the joy you get when you help someone in need? Well you can have that feeling all the time if you volunteer because you are always helping people in need by giving them animals to eat.

For the record, you can see amazing monuments and other amazing things by just volunteering. You get to see these things for free because you have to go to some places like how I saw the Acropolis and I took a grondola ride so that was fun.

Something else is that you can get out of the drafts. I know because when I was on the ship, Iturned 18 and they said to keep going for my service and so that made me happy.

Finally, you get to have afun way back. I know because there is nothing to do so to pass the time. We played baseball and volleball games and even had a table tennis or ping pong tournament. We also played fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling games to pass the time.

So since I told about how voluntering could get you out of the drafts, see amazing monuments, have fun on the way back, and help people in need, I hope you take my word for it and be a seagoing cowbot like me.
