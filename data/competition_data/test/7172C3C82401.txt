Many people or specially teenager around the world does not have the opportunity to go to the school because some of them need to work to pay their bills and what they need. This is a great idea for all of those teenager because they can be able to attend classes from their home and learn after work,but the mos important thing is that they should get education. In my opinion is too bad for those teenager who have the opportunity to have their parents which means that they pay all their bills and what they need. For those teenager is bad idea because they have all the time to go to the school and learn faster than those who did not have the opportunity.

First, for those teenager who live in the United State is very difficult to attend the school because some of them came here to work. However, they have the age to be and attend the school but they were to force to work because most of them support their family in their country. In my opinion this offer that some schools are giving is an amazing idea because now they can learn from home by online or video conferencing. The school is very important for the human becuase nowaday if you have more education your value is higher but if you don't have education in this country your value is very low. Therefore, these people need to make good use of these big opportunity because if they achieve to get education they will get a better job,too.

Next, life is very weird sometimes because the people who is attending the school they does not want to go to the school and all of those who doesn't have the opportunity they want to attend the school. I had have the opportunity to meet guys than they have everything what they want but they do not like the school because they prefer to go to another place to smoke,drink alcohool or something like that. they are getting bad habit. Furthermore, they are leaving the time to pass and wasting it and then, for those guys is reallybad idea because they have all the time to learn faster than others.

Finally, the eduacation is very important for everybody because with education you can get a better job and also to get a better future. In my case, I really struggling with school because I work and attend the school so, I know that it is very hard to do both things at the same time but at the end I know that I will be a successful man and that's why I never give up I just have my head up and I trusth in God that he is giving me strenght to keep working hard and I will get my diploma. After that first God I will keep working for my future.

In conclusion, all the opportunity that come from us is fine because the opportunities just come one time. This opportunity that some schools are given to the students is really good because when they get sick and they can not go to the school they can do it from their house and do not loss classes and be able to be really with the classes. As before I say the education is very important to achive goals in life. For those guys who does not have the opportunity to attend school

I just could say that they need to strunggle very hard. In life nothing is impossible if god close doors is because he is going to open another one much better.Â
