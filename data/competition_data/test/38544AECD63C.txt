Summer is the one thing that students look forward to the most during the year. Depending on the class and teacher, work is assigned to be completed before returning to school. Sometimes the work assigned can be a bore but other times students actually enjoy the work that teachers give them. Summer projects assigned by teachers can take up a lot of time that students need. Although some may believe otherwise, personal examples, interests and time proves that summer projects should be student-designed.

Personal examples prove that summer projects should be student designed. For example, I recall once that I had a summer project for a history class that I was going to take. A topic that was extremely boring and unfamiliar to me was assigned. I had no idea what I was doing nor did I actually understand the project. This shows that if projects were student-designed, students would be able to learn about a topic they actually know allowing them to perform better on it. Rather than doing a topic that they are weak in, students should be allowed to create summer projects that are suitable to them. Some may argue that when assigned an unfamiliar topic by teachers that students are given the opportunity to learn something new. This is not true because in many cases when a student is forced to do something they do not know best, they do not actually learn something. Therefore, this supports the fact that summer projects should be student-designed.

Interests prove that summer projects should be student-designed. My friend Generic_Name once had a book project in English that she had no interest in at all. The book and what she had to do were both strictly decided by her teacher. She would always text and call me complaining about how she had no motivation to do it. This shows that students should have the freedom of choosing what project they want to do, and how to approach doing the project. Teachers should not force students to do summer projects they have no interest in doing because then it will lead to the student not completing them. One may argue that students should not have the freedom to design their own summer projects because there are specific aspects that the student needs to learn. This is not true because if a student is assigned something they do not want to learn in the first place, they will not learn anything at all. Therefore, interests also support the claim that summer projects should be student-designed.

Time proves that summer projects should be student-designed. Many students happen to have summer jobs and are even on sports teams. My friend Generic_Name had soccer practice five days of the week with work right after. Some weekends she even had games so she barely even had time for herself. She did not have time to do any of the projects that were assigned by her teachers because she was just simply too busy and she was overloaded with summer work. This shows that if students are allowed to design their own projects that they can choose how much work they want to do on it. Student-designed summer projects can prevent students from having way too much work to complete all at once. Some argue that if a student is being productive and using their time effectively then they should be able to complete a project created by a teacher. This is not true because sometimes a student just simply does not have the time due to other commitments, meaning that if they are given the opportunity to design their own projects that they can easier balance out their workload. Time proves as well that summer projects should be student-designed.

Summer projects are important because they allow students to continue learning even when they are not in school. Summer projects that are student-designed have even more importance because they allow students to learn topics that are more suitable for them. In the past students have always been assigned summer work designed by teachers and have always dreaded it, but when they are allowed to design their own it has been very enjoyable. In the future, more schools should encourage students to design their summer own projects because they could learn so much from them. In order for students to learn during the summer, they should be assigned work that they will actually enjoy so they can use the rest of their summer time to relax. After all, teachers want students to be as relaxed as possible when coming back to school!
