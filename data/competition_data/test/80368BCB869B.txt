Before my grandfather passed away, he would always say,"Don't dislike things until you try it." I feel the same about extracurricular activities. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Doing an extracurricular activity can reduce things things like stress and anxiety. It can also help with building teamwork and social skills with people within a team or club. Last but not least, it can boost their confidence and people will acknowledge them.

To begin with, an extracurricular activity can reduce distracting things in life such as stress and anxiety. on my first day of middle school, I decided to join the school's ,according to the band director, spectacular band program. After choosing and learning how to play my instrument, I felt that I could relax and take my mind off homework and other stressful things. Overall, the feeling of trying something new and something I enjoyed really helped to lower my anxiety and stress. After questioning my fellow band mates about how they enjoyed band, most of them replied that they will do it the following year.

After that, playing a sport or being in a club can help build social and teamwork skills with the people around them. Back when I was around eight, I played soccer with people in my school I had never met before. I was extremely nervous as if I was presenting an idea in front of a entire live audience in a stadium. Then we had a little talk with the coach and our teammates. After getting to know each other, I felt more and more comfortable as we moved through practices everyday after school. As we worked on our skills and communication, both my teammates and I were getting better. Before the tournament, we were ready to face off against the best team in the league. Our practicing paid off and we won the tournament and large trophies.

Last but not least, extracurricular activities and boost one's confidence and morale. It can also give the person more acknowledgment. When ever people in sports or teams win game they are boosting and more happy. According to a study, 86% of all students that play sports also do better at school and tests than students that don't.

Most studies even show that happiness is like a domino effect. When one person sees someone else happy, they also feel more enjoyed by the joy around them and so on. When a certain group or team keeps winning, they are noticed as a team that is better. They reach that status because they work hard and it comes out to a great profit. Anyone could be that team if they work hard enough.

In conclusion, students should participate in any extracurricular activity that they prefer to join. Main reasons is that it reduces anxiety/stress, builds skills in teamwork and communication, boosts confidence, and gives acknowledgment. Altogether, participating in an extracurricular activity can bring benefit to anyone who tries. Like my grand father used to say,"Don't dislike things until you try it."
