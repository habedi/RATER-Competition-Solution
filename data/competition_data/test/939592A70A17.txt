Dear senator,

I am writing to you from the villages charter school in The Villages Florida. I am concerned with the way electing the president is done. I feel that the way it is done is not only unfair but illogical.

To begin with, I feel that the way the president is elected is not a fair way. I feel this way because a state can not controll how big or small it is, therefore giving it a small number of electoral votes lowers the importance of your vote If you live in a small place like rhode island, this makes people less interested in voting. If a president goes to his home state he usually gets the votes from there. so if a president was from texas then he will already be going on a great start.

If popular vote was used instead of electoral vote the voting system wold make people not only want to vote more but to know that it realy counts for a reason.

there are many things wrong with the electoral college, however one main issue is when there is a tie, when there is a tie in the electoral college votes the descion is then pushed to the house of representatives, and the vice president is chosen by the senator. this is a huge flaw because of how mant replublicans are in the house. this makes it unfair for a democratic representer get the job.

In conclusion i feel that the way voting is done should be changed and made to poularnvote insteadof electoral college. Thank you.

Sincerley
