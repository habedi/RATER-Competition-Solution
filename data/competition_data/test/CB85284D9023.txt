Projects during summer break might not seem appealing to most students. When you think of summer you probably don't imagine projects and homework. Summer break is a time to relax and have fun, but I do think it's important to keep your brain working while you're enjoying your time away from school. Teachers should assign summer break projects for the bettering of your knowledge and to prepare for the upcoming school year.

Teachers are teaching you for a reason. They're passionate about the subject, or they enjoy informing others of what they know. Sometimes, if you're starting a new class in the upcoming year teachers will want you to complete a project on the subject. Mainly to inform you of what you'll be learning about in the near future. Projects designed and assigned by teachers while on break are to help you learn better and to make sure you won't be slacking during your summer vacation. I believe that this is a great idea, and it will only benefit everyone involved.

During long breaks away from school, some people tend to forget some of the material they were taught in the previous school year. Receiving projects from teachers will help to retain the knowledge. It's easy to forget things that aren't exactly important to you, even if you probably should remember them for your own good. Not everything that you may learn in school will be something you're interested in, but most things are good to have buried in our brains, just in case. Some people are just simply forgetful and may easily forget something that could be essential for the next level in a certain class. Assigning a project will ensure that you're completely prepared and have retained all important information required to start the new class. For example, you will need to retain information from Spanish 1 to move on to Spanish 2.

Some people might argue that summer break should be a time that students have off. Hence the word "break". But, I believe that as a student you should always be doing things to potentially better your academics. A project isn't going to interfere with your relaxation too much. Summer break is full of free time and I think anyone could make time to complete a project assigned to them by their teacher. Completing assignments over break is very fair and reasonable to me. Your teachers are just trying to help you.

Now, if the projects were student-designed I would imagine students creating a very easy project so that they don't have to spend much time completing it. Some students might take the easier route and not complete the project at all. Teachers are most likely very fond of the topic they are teaching and will know how to perfect the project and make sure to give their students a fun assignment while also making sure they are getting a lot of information out of completing it. Your teachers are people who are there to make sure you get a great learning experience, and only want to see you do well. I believe them assigning work over summer break is a great idea.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are the better option. They are ensured to be helpful and will most likely better you academically. Your teachers support you and only want to see you do well. Assigning a project over summer break is a great way to make sure you dont forget any essential information.
