During our day and age vehicals are extremely common every where you look there is a vehical. Vehicals are the second largest producer of carbon emissions in America, right behind power plants From what the artical "The End of Car Culture".

Personal vehicals are not a nesesity there are many ways you can find your self going back and forth between locations even if it comes down to riding a bike. This world is all we got so why not treat it the best way we can and conserve it, you only get to live here once so make a differnce even if it is as small as picking a day out of the week to ride a bike to work or school. I personaly think the goverment should bput a ban on cars for certain days of the week and if people fail to follow that law their should be punishment not a small one either earth is the mother of all life she protects us she nurishes us and takes care of us but yet we treat her like she is worthless. I know i wouldnt want anyone slapping my moher in the face and treating her like she is worthless so dont treat our mother like she is not something worth saving!

Their are also other ways to ensure that we reduce carbon emmisons relased by tailpipes of cars for one cities could build cities closer together so when people want to travel the dont have to spend hundreds of dollars in gas that is slowly but surely distroying our home. People could use car polling or even turn their gas powered cars in for an hybrid that uses electricity to power the engine.
