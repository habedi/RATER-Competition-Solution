Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that changing the school policy is a wrong choice. By increasing the minimum grade point, the students will have to work even harder. By balancing school work and sports it would make the students more exhausted then they already are. Most middle schools require only a C in their classes. I invite you to continue reading this letter if you would like to know why i feel so. Also , as you are reading I would like you to think to yourself "Are you making the right choice for you and the school.

One reason, would be the workload is increased to twice as much. According to two-thirds of my family, when they were in middle school the minimum grade point was only a C. They think by changing the grade point would break the tradition of the school. Also, in my close group of friends they all think the grade point minimum should indeed not be changed. Another reason would be that a student survey i took the week you announced this change over ninety percent say the policy should be left alone.

In addition, most students would not have that sixty minutes of exercise recommended. It is a known fact that America has one of the highest rates for obesity. Since the policy is changed it would make those academically challenged not able to participate in the sports they enjoyed. Which means they are not getting the exercise they need. Over half of the students population feel discouraged.

Finally, changing school policy would lead to our school's decline in sports. I have asked my inner group of friends if they would still join sports if the policy was changed and eighty percent replied "no." Not only that, ninety-one percent of the students population say they might not even consider sports after the policy change. Changing the policy now would lead to a decline in sports.

The sports' policy should not be changed. One the workload of a student would increase, two they would not be getting the recommended sixty minutes of exercise, and three the students interest in sports would decline. I urge you, the principal to not change the school sports' policy. By changing the school policy you are not only hurting your reputation but your students as well.
