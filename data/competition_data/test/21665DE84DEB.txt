The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration consists of,44 nations that came together to help countries recover their food supplies,animals and more.

They hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,he got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea,on his second trip luke served as a watchman.

His job was to check on all of the animals every hour.

One time he said he slipped and fell on his backside and his heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship,thankfully a sharp peice of metal stopped his slide,or he would have flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive,but he could not work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs.

Luke also found fun on board,especially on return trips.

When the animals had been unloaded,the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

In conclusion, he feels that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure. Luke quotes,"I'm grateful for the oppurtunity,"he says. "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." Lukes example of being a "Seagoing Cowboy" shows how you today how,by being on a boat,can make a difference.
