dear principal,

How do you think the students would feel about your decision? i think different about this. my reasons for this are first what if a student is doing there work but always have a c but it is a high something like a 79 and they really want to be one the basket ball team but they cant. my second reason is what if they do have a b average but is one point away from a c would you allow them to be on a team. last but not least my third reason is what if they have meet the standard and is allowed on the basketball team but while they are on there grades start to drop. would they be able to still be on the team.

If a student is doing his/her work all the time but they some how always end up with a very high c could they be on the team. i remember back at my old school i wanted to be on the team for my school but i couldn't because i had an c. its not because of us students that our grades are low yes we understand that sometime it is but you have to think a bout it, would you want to be in the same place as us.

Lets say a student has a b average and is able to be on the team but there b average id very low and is close to c would you still allow them on the team. we all now school comes before an activity but we work very hard to pass so that we can move on to the next grade. what if you seen our grade have showed allot of improved over the past few weeks would you allow a basketball team then?

If you had a student on the basketball team and they love basket very much but you see there grades are starting tot drop very much. what would you do. lets say i am a student and i am attending your school you see that my grades a above an b average and you see i can also lay very well at basket ball or and other sport. when i get on the team my grades start to go down to a b, and as i keep playing they keep dropping until i' m at a low c well i get put off the team or would you give me time to pull the grade up.

you see there are many reasons why i think not being able to play sports until you are at least at a b ravage is a bad choice. you see that we are tring to do better at our work we are focused and always prepare
