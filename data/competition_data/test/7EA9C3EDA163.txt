While many students would at first believe that distanced learning is better, most parents would actually agree that a learning environment with real students and teachers is more beneficial. With the exception of special cases (like medical reasons that may prevent a student from attending a school campus) having human interaction is critical for a true learning environment. For example from personal experience most interactions I've had with other kids my age who partake in distanced learning or go to private schools have been awkward, rude, and for lack of a better word weird.

The idea of being able to learn from the comfort of your home everyday can definitely be enticing to students. Not having to wake up early, go outside, and being able to use your computer all day! That all sounds really nice at first. But students won't be able to realize what they will lose until it's gone and too late to have back. As humans we need physical interaction to live, humans are very social creatures and most of the friends kids have come from school. Having that social experience everyday builds character and prepares students for the real world, it's one of the few and most important things kids will learn and use for the rest of their lives and most of them don't even know it.

In conclusion while many students would at first believe that distanced learning is better, it could potentially be more harmful to their development later in life. Social interaction in schools isn't just fun but is important practice for the real world and teaches students the invaluable lesson of respectful communication. Smooth and respectful communication is imperative to accomplishing most things in life because no one can get anywhere in life on knowledge alone. Getting a job, loan, or any kind or relationship would be impossible without respect, admiration, and of course people liking you all things that can only come from knowing how to socialize with others and having that experience.
