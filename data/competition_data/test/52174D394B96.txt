The Face on Mars had no alien help to be formed. The reason we know this is because aliens can not create shadows. It stated in the article that the features were formed by shadows. The face is just a big rock that could have been formed from eroding rock and metiorites hitting the surface of the planet. As you can see the face does become eroded from 1976 through 2001. If it was created by aliens the rock formation would have stayed in tact possibly. It would not have eroded, it could have a few chizzle marks but other than that it would still look perfectly clear. Also if the face was created by aliens then it would have ment some kind of symbol.

On mars so far there is no possible way ro live there without certain eqipment. There is so far no possible way that the rock could have been made by aliens or anciet civilizations because they couldn't survive without water and the pressure on their head could have killed them. If it was made by ancient civilizations this would mean that there was water somewhere on mars at sometime which is impossible since it is somewhat close to the sun and all the water would have been dried up in probably in about a week.

In conclusion if at sometime there was any trace of aliens or ancient civilization on that planet they wouldn't have survived. If they did they would have been able to keep a generation on that planet and water. So the face is just a rock that has been eroded.
