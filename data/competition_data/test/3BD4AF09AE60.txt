I'm trying to convincing you to be a Seagoing Cowboys program, because one reason, why you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys, is that you can take care of the animals, if you like animals a lot.

Other reason why you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program, is that you will go other part of the world, or even making new friends there.

But, it will take about two weeks to get to the place your going to get the animals, or getting back your home.

Other reason why you should be in the program because you will get pay, and you are helping people to get more animals, or food. When you become a Saegoing Cowboys you will take care of the animals almost every hour. You got to feed the animals, clean the animals, and give the aniamls to the people you were going to help them get animals.

When you get the animals you will be them in a room, and you will go to a small ship, but not that small.

At night you need to check the animals every hour, even if it raining, or when the sea is dangers. Well I hope that I convince you to become a Seagoing Cowboys program.
