Considering To Change The Average To Play Sports

I think we shouldn't have to have a c average because grades shouldn't effect our sports because our grades don't have nothing to do with the way we play sports. We should get to do many activities without having to have a one specific grade because we are all different and some may not be as smart as others but that doesn't mean we cant play that sport because we aren't has smart as the other students.

We should be able to do anything anyone can do without having to have a b average i could kind of understand lower than a c average because that person wasn't try enough or there best. But as long as we have at least a c average we should be able to play the same sport as someone with a b average or a average. Like my friend is not so smart but she loves basketball and she is really good at it she beats me every time but she doesn't have the best grades so she cant play, so no one would never no how good she was except for maybe when we have gym.

My personal opinion is we shouldn't make a change in that we shouldn't have to have a b average because some people don't have the best grades they could get. Some people want to be pros at a sport and that's what they want to do for the rest of there life and they cant because of there grade because they never got a chance to and if they did do the sport and was good at it then they would know they had to pull there grade up.
