It would be impossible for the face to be created by aliens because new high image resolutions and 3D altimetry from

NASA's Mars global survey reveals the face on mars was really just a mesa. It also shows that its formed by shadows giving the the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos and shows that it was just anatural landfom. Their was no alien momument after all. The pictures also show that the landfrom is equivelent to mesas landforms that can alo be found in American West.

Also if u look at the three photos from viking 1 1976 and the one from 1998 and the latest image from 2001. The higher the resolution the more it doesnt look like a face. The 1976 photo its looks like a face. Then the 1998 photo it looks like nothing to me. But when you look at the 2001 phot it looks like hills with canyons or crakes near them. So you would have to give me a good reason and explanation how this looks like aliens created it. In conclusion tahts why i dont think it was created by aliens and its just a natural landform.
