Imagine you are a student and your principal is forcing all students to participate in at least 1 after school activity and, you do not know if you should participate or not. In my opinion, I agree with the principal that all students should participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity due to the amount of fun, making friends, and less free time.

Extracurricular activity can be so much fun and exciting, even if its a sport, helping with yearbook or even serving on the school council. But, remember not all activities are fun to you. What makes a extracurricular activity fun is that it makes that person happy of what he or she is doing. For example, In middle school my friend and I both tryout for our school Football team and Basketball team. After we tryout, My friend decided to do football than basketball because she like throwing and catching the ball unlike myself I prefer basketball over football because I like shooting and having supportive teammates. This example shows that extracurricular activities can be fun when you find the one that most interest you.

Another reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is the people they are going to meet.

When playing a sport or joining a club students are going to meet all different kinds of girls and boys that they probably never seen or talked to in their entire life. Doing these after school activities helps the students bond with other kids or even help them become friends. For example, there is a girl she new to your school and she does not really have friends but, she likes to draw. So, she sign up for the art club and see bunch of kids from her class that also sign up for art. At first, she was nervous then she and the other students started talking and were getting along well. This example explains that joining a club or sport team can bring you closer to new people.

Even though extracurricular activities can be fun and bring people closer it can also take up a bunch of free time.

Some students will just wake up, go to school, do homework, sleep, and repeat every single day. Doing after school activities such as basketball, soccer, yearbook, art and etc. Can keep students busy from around 1 hour or 2. For example, when I was in 6th grade I did not do any extracurricular activities but, when I tryout for basketball and made it. It kept myself pretty busy all afternoon everyday. Now, I wish I had so free time for myself. But, all the example was explaining that doing clubs and sports kept students busy.

To mostly sum up everything, students should a least give it a try to participate in their schools extracurricular activities to see if they will have fun or even meet new people. That's why I believe students should participate due to amount of fun, making friends, and less free time.
