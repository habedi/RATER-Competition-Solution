I feel that it could be good for some students to learn at home because some teens feel safe at home and they dont have to worry about school shooter's some kids dont to talk to others there anti social like its hard for them to open up but if you think about it can be bad for kids to learn at home cause there brother or sister could mess with and distract them or they could say they doing work and be playing fortnite or call of duty and other games. It would be cool to be able class from home now if i was to put myself in this prompt i would go to school because i have 3 brother's it would be hard to work. lets say we were talking about having a food court in school for lunch that would be nice but we got to go over the pro's and con's school would get more money because more student's are eating lunch you could have five guys, burger king, MC Donald, subway, pizza hunt, KFC, i hop for in the morning. but the bad thing is students start to get fat from so much fast food. Now back to kids learning at home it could be good or bad got to check the pro's and con's it could any way so what do i think about it i say no stay in school not home school. Me im a stay in school an graduate and become a rapper or a football player or go to the military and help people if you dream it you can do it follow your goals.
