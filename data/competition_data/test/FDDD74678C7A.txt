In a way it can be useful. Not always for the most part it can be used for looking over old style paintings to see what the person in the picture or how the person is feeling, Showing us the emotion if the characters eyes,smile,ect.

To support these claims it tells you in this short passage showing and telling us what they were doing anda normal home computer cannot use or do these kinds of things, But only a very special strong kind of computer can do this, Telling us only people with very strong computers can really do this kind of thing and also telling us it wilbe very hard for normal kinds of people to do this even if they wanted to invest this kind of money for a very strong computer only to tell the kinds of emotion someone in a painting or a picture in general. This is the evidence I have to support my first paragraph in conclusion from what I gathered from this passage it may be more useful later on if it can do even more such as helping solving crimes or something along the lines of "helpful".
