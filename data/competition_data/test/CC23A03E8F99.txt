Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have recently been informed that the policy for playing sports has been changed. I for one, am strongly against this. You may want to know why this is a bad idea. Well there are a few reasons. For one as you know, most of the students on the athletic program don't have the newly required academic average that is mandatory to participate. Do you really want to make at least thirty children regret themselves and miss experiencing the only time in their lives where sports is still about fun? TEACHER_NAME, I am aware that this new policy will help make students try harder in school, but athletics can benefit a child as well. Sports help people of all ages achieve a healthy weight and can even help them do better in school, so why would you want to deny this simple activity from a child?

Another reason I believe that this new policy will not benefit this fine school is that students need room to have fun in their lives. Do you remember your childhood, when you would go after school to play some pick-up basketball with friends, practice for a sporting event, or just relax and watch clouds? These are all fun past-times that students perform today. I know that our generation is stereo-typed for being lazy, self-centered, annoying, and dumb. But we are more than that, I guarantee you. Look at some of the great athletes in the world, sure they practiced a lot when they were kids, but they still had fun. Larry Bird and Usian Bolt both described their childhoods as fun times. Athletes are not the only ones that had fun in their childhood. Our current president, Barrack Obama, has had fun in his childhood too. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and even Abe Lincoln all had joyous, free times as a kid. And that turned out pretty well for them. I understand that at this point in our lives school is pretty much what we do. It's just expected of us. But please, look beyond that. In a Catholic school, the values you teach us help us throughout our lives. Everyone one of my teachers has told me that they want me to succeed, so if you want us to succeed, let us have some fun.

Also, athletics are a great way to meet new people and build relationships with those people. Social life is important to everyone, and having a large group of friends makes people confident. Students that have friends also, in my opinion, do better in school. Isn't that what you want? Sports are also a way to let out emotions. If I'm feeling angry at my mother, i sometimes go outside and shoot basketball. After about twenty minutes, I feel better. For teens this a great way to spend time and feel better.

Overall I would say that sports is a good activity. it gives positive results and helps us succeed in life. Denying this simple request to repeal the new rule in my eyes is terrible. I know it's up to you, the principal. So I'm begging you. Please let these students participate. I know that this is the right choice. Commitment to excellence, that's what we need. The students would with the lower average would approve of this. I gua
