Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, students would benefit taking classes online and have opportunities while doing them at home than the school.

In this case students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home and here are some of the reasons why it would benefit them:

They would be able to be in a different room of the house that makes them comfortable.

Student would have opportunities to go to different places such as visiting a country or a state and still take the class online without missing anything.

If the student is sick, the student can still take the class in the computer by listening to what the teacher says.

There is no need to buy school supplies because everything is on the computer.

Having more time to spend at home.

Getting the majority of work done.

Students would be able to concentrate better, and example of that is that they will not feel pressed by waking up early, thinking what they would wear, waiting for the bus and especially in the cold weather. They would have more time and opportunities to organize everything they have in mind also if the student works, the student won't feel tired and will feel more productive when working.

Online classes would benefit every student in general and it would be great if all the school's offered that option, also I believe that schools should do that but in the case of an University there should be online classes too but it would be more important if they went to an University and learn more than they would in an online class. The reason is because since they are not teenagers anymore they should focus more on learning something that would help them.

A positive way in taking classes online is that only the students can hear you but they don't have to see you in person and they won't make fun of you because nobody knows each other also the teacher can hear everything you say because there is not too many students that join online courses. It would also helps prevent something that we don't want to happen, that is why it makes it more easier.

A negative way in going to a school is that a student can feel tired, stressed or depressed because I feel like sometimes school is all about passing and what students try to is to get their work done to have a good grades and they get stressed, also if there is somebody that is bullying another person, that person that is being bullied can get depressed and not want to go to the school. They don't say anything because they're scared that something will happen to them.

Taking online classes won't make you worry about anything but doing work that has been assigned and also you feel comfortable because you're at your house and you can feel free to express your opinions and when you're at the school not everybody rise their hands because they are too shy to answer it in front of everybody or if you say an answer that is not correct some students might laugh at you. But that is not good because it can make you feel insecure about yourselves.

In all I believe that taking online or video conferencing from home would benefit students by giving them more opportunities and to focus more in their subjects by not feeling stressed of thinking what they would have to wear, if they need a binder or a notebook, waiting for the bus and being late because by doing online courses everything is on the computer and all you do is stay home, pay attention to the class and have work done also it would help students prevent missing classes and feel tired for waking up too early to get dressed. Sometimes when students feel tired, stressed or depressed it can be because they have to do the same routine since Monday through Friday. But when having online courses you can be eating while you take the course, of course in a respectful way, so the teacher and the students won't get bother and this is why students should take online classes.
