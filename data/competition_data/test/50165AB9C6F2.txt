Dear principle,

I think that you should allows students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times. This would be really fun to do so that the students can text their friends and wont be using their cell phones during class. If you let us do this we will make sure we have our phones off for class. some students would think this is a really good idea to because a lot of students love to text during school and since we are not allow to have cell phones during school hours students still text anyways and if you let us use our cell phones during lunch period or any other free times then students wouldn't have to worry about texting in class and getting their cell phones taken away. when the students text at school and get caught the teacher takes their phones away.

If you let us use our cell phones during lunch time you wouldn't have to worry about taking the cell phones away or anything. I believe this is a good policy because if u don't allow students to use their phones some students don't care and will use it anyways and that's why they get caught and their phones get taken away and then their parents have to come get it and its just a lot of mess.

If you think this policy is good then you would use it. I know a lot of other students would really like this policy to not just me but everyone else.

A lot of students love to text in school and they pay more attention to their phones then learning in class. And if u let us use this policy i think that more students would pay more attention in class since their phones would be turned off. If you don't think is a good policy then their are a lot of other ones. It would be better to have the phones turned of so that students can pay more attention to class but i think it would be nice if you let us use our phones when we have free time and it would be really nice to do.
