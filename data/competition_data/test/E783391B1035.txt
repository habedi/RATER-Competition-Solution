I personsonally think it would benefit everyone if we abolish electrical colledge. We should change the election to most popular voted. This would be easier and also fair. The election should only determine who is going to be our president not the electors. This way it just creates a bid mess for them to deal with anyway.

For example "over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"."This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency". The votes should be direct to dtermine who will be president of our country.

"The electral colledge consists of 538 electors". Thats alot of electors. Why not just make it more simple and try to avoid voting the electors and lets try to just vote directly for the president.

In conclusion I would have to agree that we should abolish Electral colledge. We should just get right to the point. Lets just and only just vote for who should be president. Don't waste your time trying to vote for the electors, make it easy for yourself. "Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors". Why so complicated?
