Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of the FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System. This system was created by Dr. Paul Eckman He classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. When you first try out the system the first process begins with the computer constructs with a 3-D model of the face. It gathers all the movement of the facial muscles, it shows if your mad or happy "your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised" this quotes says that the system can tell us your face expression, how you feeling during that time. If they tested out students in a classroom with this system FACS it would be valuable because it would show teachers how they students are really feeling that day, it would show teachers if the students really care about there eduaction which this would help out teachers because they'll see who really cares. Like when Mona Lisa smile, they tested it out the picture with the system to find out how she was really feeling "she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry" this showed that the sysytem can tell all the different types of emotions at one point which this shows us that if they tested this system out in classroom with serval students this would show all the different types of emtions they're feeling that day and would help out a lot.
