Dear principal,

Community service should not be forced upon students.

It is very good for a student to perform community service but, it should be the individuals choice.

You can not force kids to good deeds you can only encourage.

Many kids are to busy for community service and already after school activities they are participating in.

Community service is not a necessity.

After school sports and activities are played everyday by many kids not all students have time to join in with community service also.

All kids should be participating in some type of activity outside of school.

It is good for kids and gives them something fun to do with their free time.

Community service is an excellent choice but can not be handled underneath some students schedules.

A child must have some independence.

He should have some say in what is free times go to. Not all kids think that is a good use of their time.

You can not force the kids to do good deeds.

What you can do is encourage the kids to do good deeds.

Encourage the school to participate in community service.

In most cases encouragement is much more effective than force.

Let the students decide whether they want to perform community service.

Encourage everyone about this great after school activity.

If a kid has been participating in other activities outside of school and does not have time for more than he shouldn't be forced to give up his activities.

Students shouldn't be made participate in community service.

sencerly,
