Online schooling and virtual classes have become very popular in recent years. More and more schools have offered these online classes as a way for students who can't come into an actual class to get an education. There are many schools all over the United States that offer this program and it would not be suprising if more schools start to offer online education. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are sick to get an education, it allows students who have a disability to get an education, and it allows students who are being bullied at school to get an education.

First off, some students can get sick for a very long time or even a short amount time. Either way, students will be missing school and be missing out an getting an education. Whether that is just the common cold, or the flu, the student will most likely not go to school because they do not want to get their peers sick. Especially with the flu that has spread all over America, and the Coronavirus that has spread all over the world, students will not be able to go to school if ill or contaminated. Students who have the oppurtunity to get an online education, will not be effected by an illness and still get the education they deserve.

Next, students who have a disability, mentally or physically, will still be able to get an education with online classes. There are many people in the world who are mentally or physically disabled, who are not getting the education they deserve because they cannot go to school. The medium to small population of disabled people in the United States will be able to learn new things and new ideas just from the implementation of online classes. The physically disabled may not have the means or ability to get to an actual classroom but with virtual classes, the physically disabled will have an oppurtunity to get the same education as the rest of the population. Virtual classes would benefit the disabled incredibly.

Finally, students who are being bullied in school will be able to get an education without being tormented or harrassed. Bullying is an awful epidemic that has only got worse with the introduction of cyberbullying but it has always been terrible in school. A large amount of the population of students in school are bullied and as awful as that is, it is only getting worse. Schools are not doing much about bullying because either the student's don't report it, or the school doesn't do anything about it. With the oppurtunity of online classes and virtual learning, the students who are bullied will be able to get an education in a safe, and comfortable enviorment. Students who are being bullied would love this idea as it allows them to get an education without any terrible distractions.

One may argue that online education limits human to human interaction and will cause the students to be antisocial. However, students in these circumstances will be able to get an education in which everyone deserves, and be able to go to school sponsored social events and do other social things, just not inside a school. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are ill to get an education, it allows students who have a mental or physical disability to get an education, and it allows students who are being bullied at school to get an education.
