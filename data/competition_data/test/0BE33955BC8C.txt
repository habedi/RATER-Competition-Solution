Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. Driverless cars are a phenomenal idea becauase they're innovative,all major car compaines are moving toward the driverless way and they're safe. This essay will disscuss these three reasons on why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea.

First driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. It states in the passage "Originally,many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads". This is putting into perspective that even futurists didn't believe it was possible but Google has achieved this monument to perfection. Also in the ariticle it says "founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream". As the original founder of this project he has even reached the level of innovation that he has been striving and working for since 2009.

Secondly alot of major car companies are striving for making their product driveless. For example in the passage it conveys "Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time". This is shownig how a major car company as innovative as Tesla is going to release a self driving car of their own. In that same paragraph it informs "Mercendes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020". Showing that even some of the luxury brands and the major car compaines are releasing a driverless car. Showing how they agreee with where the future is going and how much of a phenomenal idea it is.

Lastly, the driverless cars are safe and take limitless precatious to stay safe. It describes in the article "Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearveiw mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor". This derscribes how many preperations is took for the car to be very safe.

In conclusion I have disscussed the three reasons why self-driving cars are a good idea. The reasons eing they're innovative, major car companies are doing it and they're safe. What do you think about the cars?
