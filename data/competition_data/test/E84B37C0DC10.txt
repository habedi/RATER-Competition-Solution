Think about your future, for example your dream collage. Don't you think that they would love see different activities you have done during your past year. To see if you are type of person they want to be at their school. I agree that participating in an extracurricular activity is a good detection to make .

I believe extracurricular activity can help them get into a good college. First doing a sport can help. Colleges love to see really good students you are dedicated to a certain sport. Which they would love for them to join their school cause of how good of a player they are. Secondly voluteering is another good reason. Colleges love to see when kids take the time out of their day to help those in need. Therefore if they take an activity involving voluteering it can help them get into the college they prefer. Lastly taking a student council or being a leader in some activity. Colleges have to determined if you are right for the college. Taking an activity that shows your leadership and hard working are amazing traits to be shown in a person. Sports, volunteering, showing leadership are the reasons why I think it is great for college applications.

Its a great way for you to interact. You could make new friends. Firstly when you participate in activity it is a great way to meet new people and become friends with someone who share the same interest. Secondly you are able to learn new things. Whatever activity you participate in, you would mostly learn something new. Therefore it could help you in the near future . Lastly it can change you as a person. When you are around new people and you learn their differences , you could change as a person and see the beauty between other. Making new friends , learning something new , and changing you as a person are reasons why extracurricular activities are great for interacting.

I agree that students should take extracurricular activities. It being great for college and great way of interacting are the reasons why I think so. Taking the time out of your day and doing something new can never hurt anyone.
