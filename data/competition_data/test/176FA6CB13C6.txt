Just about everyday, students wake up early in the morning to begin a long, exhausting day of school. We sit through hours of learning with little time for interaction with others or having some time for ourselves, just to come home and be rewarded with even more work. The offering of distance learning provides an opportunity to offset those annoyances of physically attending school, while still providing a fulfilling education.

The dread that comes with knowing you have to wake up much before you'd normally wake up is a terrible feeling, not made much better upon the realization that you have to get in the routine of waking up early five days a week. Students are seemingly deprived of sleep as a result of school. The school day begins early in the morning, and combined with the fact that many students have to stay up late in efforts to finish assignments for school, a lack of sleep for plenty of students ensues. Should students take distance learning, they'll be allowed to have more flexibility with when they begin their classes, meaning they can begin their school day later than they would if they were to just physically attend school. The work that comes with school, be it work inside or outside of school, allows for little to no time for interaction with others or time for one's self. Nowadays, some teachers are assigning insurmountable amounts of homework, projects, and extra practice which leave students with almost no time to do anything of their choice. Much of their time outside of school is devoted to schoolwork, with the exception of maybe Friday evenings and Saturdays. Regardless, two days is nowhere near enough free time for students. Being in school itself takes a toll on students, and we need more time for us to have fun to better ourselves. Distance learning provides the opportunity to set up a more manageable schedule, to allow us to have more of that free time we need.

While in school, it can most certainly be argued that a large percentage of our time in class is wasted in a sense. Personally, I can advocate for that stance as I find myself with nothing to do nearly half the time I'm in class. This time spent doing nothing makes it increasingly difficult to retain information. There is no point in learning something, just to forget it due to these consistent pauses in class, where students aren't doing anything. Should students take up distance learning, they can arrange to do all their classes within a specific window of time, allowing for them to have no time wasted while additionally allowing for a better comprehension of the content they are learning. Distance learning provides the same education as physical schooling, but without all the unnecessary time involved.

On the contrary, it can be argued that should students take up distance learning they would likely become increasingly lazy among other things of that nature. There is valid logic behind that stance as it is easy to see students constantly putting off school work to do other things, while also lacking motivation to put more effort towards assignments due to their being no teacher to enforce any consequences should they do poorly. However, I ultimately believe that that would not be the case. As long as assignments are graded and mandated, the work will be done to the same, if not to a better standard than it would be had students done it physically at school.

Distance learning's allowance for a flexible schedule is incredibly beneficial in allowing for students to better themselves both inside and outside of academics. Distance learning is definitely something that should be brought to more attention as many would find it more beneficial than physical schooling.
