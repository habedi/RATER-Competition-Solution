Driverless cars may be the future but it would be a rather risky option. Sure the driverless cars are going to have advanced technology and have a ton of motion sensors on the body of the cars but all that technology, including the crucial sensor on the roof of the car that constantly processes 3D images around the car's body can cost millions of dollars to produce.

The cost to manufacture the cars aren't the only problem, The psychological aspects contribute to the driverless car aswell stating that the fact that drivers may get bored when they aren't driving. The drivers could also doze off to sleep and miss all the warning displays about the car needed to be taken over by the driver which can lead to more accidents.

Driverless cars are also illegal to test in some states becuase the safety of the public is concerned. The hardware in these cars can easily fail and traffic laws will need to change in order who will be the one to blame if the car malfunctions- either the manufactuer or the driver. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that a car can olnly be safe if a human driver has total control. The advanced technology can throw the driver and the manufacters through a loop, which may result that the whole situation will turn into a mess and the manufacturers will be sued because the driverless cars didn't meet the highest standards for pedestrian safety.

Yes, having an extra pair of eyes in the car is very usefull when backing out or to prevent an accident thanks to the automatic brakes and sensors, but being in a car that is driverless can be very dangerous if the driver is not alert and prepared to take the wheel when there is a work zone ahead. Also the driverless cars may be very expensive because of all the technology that is enhancing the safety features. Driverless cars will cause problems in the near future if the technology malfuntions or causes harm to the driver.
