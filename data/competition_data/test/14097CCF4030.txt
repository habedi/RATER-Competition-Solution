Our principle is considering on letting us have our cell phones at school. Do you think she should let us? I think that as long as we don't have them on during class that we should be allowed to to have them. Here are a few reasons why i think we should be able to.

First, sometimes we have after school events and may need to call our parents. Our school has Drama Club, FFA, Key Club and many more. If we have a meeting after school and our parents can't get off of work we may need to call our dads. Or any other relative. This is one reason why we should be allowed to have phones at school.

Second, what if there was an emergency and our parents need to know about it. I do not think that the school will be able to notify every kids parents. If we were able to have our phones we would be able to tell them ourselves and they could come get us. This is my second reason why i think we should be able to have our phones at school.

Lastly, i think we should be able to have our phones because it is a way for some people to get a ride home if they don't ride a bus. Some parents have to work and don't have let their kids stay at home alone.

So they may need to call a friends or grandparent. Or if their parents are running late to pick them up. They might want to call and make sure that their parents are okay and see if they are almost there.

All in all, i think we should be able to have our phones at school just not in class. First we have club and after school meetings we might need to call our parents. Second there might be an emergency at school and the kids want to tell their parents. And last they might need to find a way home. These are a few reasons on why we should be able to have our phones at school.
