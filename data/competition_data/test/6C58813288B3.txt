Some people believe in different things such as aliens for example, but what about you?

We all heard about the "face on Mars" some might say it's real or others say is it NASA playing a trick on us? But it all started falling into place when we got some news about it.

I believe that this is real. No not the alien part but the face it's was fomred by natural landforms. Land forms can be created at any given moment - but this certain one just seemd to catch someone's eyes.

So on April 5, 1998 Michael and his Mars Orbiter camera took a shot of the "face" that made it look 10 times bigger than it was the viewers were shocked. Just as NASA revealed that it was only a natural land form. Some people weren't satisified just yet... they needed more information or did they want more to sound right?

So for quite awhile the argrument grew bigger on the big question " Did aliens really make this?" No one wanted to believe NASA because, they thought they knew more stuff than they were telling people. Maybe they wanted it to be something bigger or something better.....
