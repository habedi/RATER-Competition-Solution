Why do we want to have driverless cars? There are still things that the driverless cars cannot do themselves. Are they safe? Are driverless cars good for the people? In this arguement These are some of the quesions I'm going to answer in my opinion.

In the future could cars actually drive themselves? That is a question we cannot answer at this time. Right now cars can drive themselves, but not in every situation. In paragraph 2 of the artical it states " Google cars aren't truley driverless; they still alert the driver to take over..." The "driverless" cars are not so driverless. They alert you when pulling in and out of driveways, when complicated trafic issues occur, and when there is roadwork. The car will alert you in any situation where human abilities are needed. In some cars they have sensors that can sense when to stop, or if there is something the driver did not see to stop for. In paragraph 4 it states "... uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rear view window...." They have the sensors for all different things while the car is in motion. But how does that help the car be driverless?

In some cases the "driverless" cars are safe, but remember the car is controlled by a computer. It can still shut down and crash. In paragraph 2 it states "... cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash..." What happends when the car reaches one million miles? Would is shut down and crash? We don't know that because the text in the artical doesn't state that. Would someone want to have a car that could drive itself, but the human still had to be aware of the road? What if the car is on the highway and alters the human, but the human is sleeping? What if the human wasn't paying any attention to the road? That is a safety hazard. In paragraph 7 it states "... the human driver must remian alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." What person is going to pay attention to the road if the car can drive itself? Paragraph 2 also states "... 2013, BMW ... development of "Trafic Jam Assistant"... car can handle up to the speeds up to 25 mph." What person can't drive at 25 mph? Why would these cars be any safer than a regular car?

Why would anyone want "driverless" cars if they really can't drive by themselves? Would any human want to wait their turn to drive their car at 25 mph? Would the human driving the car got into an accident and they were not the one driving? New laws would have to be made for those situations. New roads would have to be worked on so that the new "driverless" cars could work. Woud anyone go through all of this trouble just so that we could wait our turn to drive our own cars? I don't think anyone would want that. So why do we need driverless cars? Just to be lazy, or to just drive at low speeds? I don't think that I would want to be lazy and drive at 25 mhp for my car to be "driverless." Would you?
