To the principal:

Students are always wanting to be allowed to have cell phones in school and use them. I think students shouldn't have cell phones in school at all. I believe this because some students cant even follow simple directions like, " Don't talk" or "Sit down. So I expect the students to take out their cell phones in class because they do that every now and then already. Most likely more students will be in detention due to the fact that they will keep on taking their cell phones out and getting into trouble.

Why would you need a cell phone at school? What would you use it for? You would just be able to use it at lunch and at other free times. Almost all the students friends are at school. So you just be texting your friends when they are right beside you are across the table from you. All students would ever do at lunch is text. Students would also eat less because they are busy texting their friends.

Some student will be sneaky with their cell phones. Students might be pretending to read a book when actually they are texting. And some might try to text in their desk.

So now you know the reasons why I think students shouldn't have cell phone in school.
