Imagine knowing what emotions people display, even though they are not always being truthful of their expressions. The invention that was created is called "Facial action coding systems" or FACS. It can read the emotional expressions of anyone. From the passage, Prof. Thomas Huang used the software to test on the Mona Lisa painting. "She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." The software explained that even though the picture makes it looklike the Mona lisa is happy, she wasn't all tht truthful of her emotions displayed in the picture.

Another example was that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal." Observes Dr. Huang, "Even though individuals often show varying degrees of an expression.'' (like not smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa." the evidence explained that people are often times seen as displaying an emotion. Even though they show said emotions, The scanner really tells what a person wasw feeling. Another piece of evidence from the article claimed that "Humans can perform this same impressive "calculation" everyday. You can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, sad, etc." The quote was stating that humans can calculate if one person is sad by saying "what's the matter?" or if they are happy, they ask what brought them in a good mood. Dr. Huang claimed thar "Artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to display an emotion." Even though most humans may have difficult knowing that said emotions are displaying (ex. Alexythmiacs or face blind people) they may depend on the software to help them understand what emotions are on display. Final piece of evidence stated that "Most human communications are nonverbal, including emotional communication and that computers will need to understand that too. Your pc at home can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona lisa's smile." A reason for that is that if a p[erson has a computer and has a look of discomfort, the computer will not really have the scanner to recognise what the person is feeling even if they want the computer to do so. In conclusion, The FACS can recognise anyones emotion with just a scan of the face, But it is good use to see if students will display anything when in the classroom.
