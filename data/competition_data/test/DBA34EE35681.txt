Dear Principal

I would like to have you pick policy number 1. If students weren't allowed to use cell phones at school then some of the study clubs might be empty at school because of how many students have to tell there parents there going to study club. Most of the teachers response to that would be "There's a phone to use in the office" but most of the time the office phone is always in use and there's always a line of like 5-7 people. Once its your turn to use the phone then your parent might of had said no then you look outside and see that the buses have left already now you have to walk 2-3 miles depending where you live all because of NO cell phones.

In Policy 1 it says specifically that "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times" in that case most of the students will have no one to text because most there friends are already with them so they can just talk face to face or if they have to advise there parents there going to an after school activity. When your in class maybe the teacher would probably be able to collect all the phones and get them after class.

I think that having cell phones at school will increase the amount of people going to after school activity's which would the school a better way of the district noticing the participation of the students making the school a better look on becoming best school. Students should always have the volume on there cell phones of only on vibrate for them not to disturb other students at school. Overall my opinion is to allow cell phones.
