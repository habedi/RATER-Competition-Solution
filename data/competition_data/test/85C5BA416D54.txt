Will i don't see phones to be a big dele so i would just let them bring them to school and use them wean ever there not in class. Plus if you don't let them bring there phone to class they well just do it any way. that will led up to getting phones taking away and then the parents will get involved and they wont be happy. so just let the kids use there phones wean there not in class it's not a big dele.

and i even see testers on there phone so if we kids get in trouble for it then i thank the testers should to. it is the only fare that if testers do it we can do it. last time i look this was the USA and in the USA we should be treated like equals. So if you want to say that teachers should be able to use there phone the students should to. so if you want to be un fare fine then students will just keep on using there phone in class. and if you band phone from school you be over your head with parents that say my son need a phone so i can know ware he is at and it just not worth going throw all that troubles to stop kids from using there phones in class wean they will just do it any way. So listen to me or don't i' m done caring what other people do because i know i' m right.
