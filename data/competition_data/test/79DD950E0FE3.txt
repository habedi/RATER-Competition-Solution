Should all students be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? There are many children who feel like they dont belong because they hang out with the wrong group or no group. School is very hard and can be tougher with nobody to talk to when you need it. There is proof that school is harder with no friends so I think they should be required to do an extracurricular activity.

Because school can be very difficult if you have no one to talk to or nobody to hangout with. It is a good idea for children to be required to do an activity. I dont think someone should have to do what the principal wants them to do. I think they should be allowed to choose what activity they want to do. This could also help with making friends and getting to know new people and talking instead of being antisocial.

There are many benefits to doing this in your school you can find the group you are supposed to be hanging out with. Im not saying drop your friends that you already have but add them to your friends and make them feel more included. There are other benefits to doing this with your school such as learning a new sport or learning something new about a topic or game. There is also a way to communicate and get to know your teachers more like if you are not into sports I think they should make teachers participate too. The teacher have to play a sport or help kids with homework.

There are disadvantages as well as advantages of doing this idea. You are being forced to do something not everyone wants or can do. You might not be good at sports and dont want join the yearbook committee. You might not have as much fun doing these things as other children do and they might be better then you at these things. These things can be hard and you might not want to do them but there will be a reward at the end for trying something new.

I think that this is a good idea to do for students to get to know each other and hangout and have exercise . This idea is very smart but I think that at the beginning of the year children should be allowed to vote on what they want to do. They should have someone draw out of a hat and choose twenty ideas for clubs and you get new clubs every nine weeks. This is a very good idea for kids who dont like talking to people and are having problems with there sport or something. You will be making new friends and getting better at other things that you want to get better at.
