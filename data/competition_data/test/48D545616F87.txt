Dear TEACHER_NAME

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME im from SCHOOL_NAME .Some of my friends think having community serves is not a good job because that take time away from what you are doing for that day. For an example u have a basketball game u want to go to it and u have community servas and you cant play because u have community servas.,but i think u should not help the community servos i think u can do something else like recycling.

Another reasons why i think you should not have community servos is because that is tacking time out from your parents from working and from kids doing what they got to do. Some of the reasons why imp saint u should not have community sevens is because if u have to go some were special you have to do community serves have some question i will like to ask, how do it feel like doing community servos its like torcha? How it is in the summer time and you have 2 do that and it is like a 95 degree weather? What made mall come up with the idea of doing community serves? You do that for people who deserve it or what? What is the confluences if u do it or you don't do it?

The reasons why imp asking you all of these questions is because i wannabe know how do the system work with community serves. Also i want to know why is it community servants that's my option for this fit of having community servos.
