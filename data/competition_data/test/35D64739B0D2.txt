Being schooled at home is what other children would've wanted and where they can just wake up at any time and doesn't worrry about being late.

There are also other types of way to attend classes at your home. For example, taking it online and video conferencing with your teacher and others from that school. And it is much more easier in a regular school.

Firstly, taking classes at home is much more comfortable than taking classes at school. Therefore, you can relax, not be tense, and not being afraid to ask questions. It is much easier to handle than a regular school.

Secondly, you're much more focus there are no one to annoy you, making such noise, or hearing somebody else talking about other stuff whether it is important or not. It is much more quieter than any of the room you've been in and your head is on the right point.

Thirdly, you don't need to worry about troubles unless you're slacking no, i'm talking about bullies those brats who always pick on the weak. Their head is not the right pont where they por they're anger all to you.

And others would say that taking classes from home can take your mind off from your objective. Because they're distraction if you have sibling and when you just can't really focus when you play games all the time and watch tv.

In conclusion, studying at home instead taking classes from a real schools can alson be hard there's really no one that you can depend on except, you have a teacher on your house now, thats much more easier.
