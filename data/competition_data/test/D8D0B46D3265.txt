Walking, jogging, or even riding a bike. All ways of transportation, right? And also, the car. Of course that'd be the intial thing most people would want rather than actually exercising to get from one point to another. However, limiting car usage would be better for our planet and for us.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it has a bystander that says, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter. She is a mother of two, and she has walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. So, not only is she a mother of two and basically walks everywhere, driving made her tense. And she claims to actually be happier walking rather than using a car to transport her to different areas. Another thing from this article includes this line, "...Ad that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States." So, if we were to not necessarily drive too often, we'd be doing the Earth a favor in making the world more dense.

Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , already off the bat. Driving in Paris is basically banned, because of smog. It states, "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." All the gases that are in the air due to cars and such could very well just harm us, and Earth. However, it is a good thing that Paris had banned that, because people who've tried to keep driving, has had to suffer a 22-euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. Other people care about our world enough to get them to stop what they're doing. Or, at least ban it for a while. But, typically, Paris has more smog than other European capitals. It says, "[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of the particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found." Now, not trying to argue with this, however, not driving for a while is something that'd be better for not just Europe, but everywhere around the world. It's a big deal, and our ozone layer could basically kill us in the end.

Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , now, by this article, it pretty much states that trying to promoted alternative transportation and reducing smog had violaters face $25 fines. It was the third year straight they've tried to do this, but people still got caught doing it. But, it does mention, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo. He does have a point here, because it helps us in the end. Another thing it adds is, "The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that begain in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the contrustion of 118 miles of bicyle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor." So basicallt not driving is a relatively great thing for us, now, not driving for a while is not any intention, but limiting it is probably what's best.

And last but not least,

The End of Car Culture , it claims that fewer people over the years have not been getting licenses and buying cars. Which, is a good sign for us. As a world all together, we shouldn't be depending on transportation (by car, of course), to get anywhere. It's much better this way for us to do this because it's mainly how we're effecting the Earth that's the problem, well.. and obesity but it's not a huge concern. But, that's just the way it is. It goes on to say that people 19-21 and older in some cases haven't even wanted a car or even attempt to get their license. And that says something. We're changing, and that's a great thing. Of course, we still will use cars, but hopefully not as much as we used to basically.

To conclude this, other transportation other than driving, would be better for the world, and we could use something else to make it better for us. Of course we'd still use cars, but not using it as much would definitely be our goal in today's world.
