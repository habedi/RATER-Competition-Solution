I think that using cell phones while driving is not the way to go because according to the law you can not drive,text at the same time simply due to the increase of crashing. Through out the recent years,more than half the populations drive and text which causes them to highly get into an accident. Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions to yourself therefore the accidents may increase rapidly throughout the years. I would prefer doing it when you're driving just because it is safer than driving. Operating a cell phones while driving can lead you to crash and will get you to a penalty for it. The safe way that I would say is to keep your cell phones off when you are driving because you'll get distracted to the cell phones once you pick it up.

The increase of the cell phone uses are very high simply to social media. Some say that there is no wrong in the doing of the cell phones use but I think that it causes many accidents and death rates to increase rapidly. The actions that many people take are actually risking their lives over a notifications on the phone and that will go horribly wrong to those whom use cell phones while driving. We have to follow certain laws from accidents and causing them. Everyday,there's at least some of the people such as young adults who text and drive all the time. Risking your life for something that doesn't have greater impact of your life is basically saying that cell phones are more important than paying attention to what the real world has.

During the years,many of the populations that causes theses accidents are young teens. Therefore,the death rate goes up throughout the years and some say that it's not the reason why. I feel like so many people look down into their phone then look up and see what's going on. For me driving and using cell phones is not the way to go for your life and for the safety,I would prefer you to always shut down your devices while driving so you don't get too distracted.
