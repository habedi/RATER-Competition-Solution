Yes I agree,Beacause I feel like students have to participate in at least one exrtacurricular activity because they can get a grade on participating. And that's really easy to do and another reason for students to participate is that students can avoide getting in trouble and go to the office and talk to the principal or go to RC.And i don't think they want to talk the principal for not participating and you only have to participate in one thing not all of the things like it can be sports,yearbook,ag,etc. Because if I we're them i would participate in an exracurricular activity that they like ore and then they don't have to worry about getting in trouble,going to the office,talking to the principal,or even goin to RC.Like they one got to do one activity it's not that hard at all and i like sports so i would an activity of sports and that's it then i would be doneand not have to worry about getting in trouble or even getting a bad grade if they even grade us but if they did i would get a good grade just for participating. And if you don't participate in something then your crazy because it's easy to do.
