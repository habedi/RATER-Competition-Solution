A wise person once said,"Education is important but the human mind must not be too overwhelmed and stressed." He or she basically stated that education is important but a working human still needs rest. Well my principal wants all students to participate in extracurricular activities. Most people disagree with the principal because students have to go through seven long hours of solving the quadratic formula, memorizing the United States court system, and writing down scientific formulas. They don't need to be obligated to do more activities out of school. I disagree with the principal forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities because students still have other activities out of school to do and they need some rest and downtime after seven long hours of learning.

Students still have other activities to do out of school. Kids can be participating in sports teams, karate, dancing, and many more. Adding extracurricular activities will interfere with these activities happening out of school. To add onto that having extracurricular activities to go on with the activities happening out of school can put too much stress on a young child's mind. For example, I play for two basketball teams out of school, if I were obligated to participate in extracurricular activities my schedule would be overlapped and crazy. I would be overwhelmed and I might even have to miss some practices because I would have to stay after school everyday.

Students need downtime and rest after a long seven hours of learning. Students have to go through the pain of doing algebra problems and memorizing scientific formulas for seven hours almost everyday. Usually when they get home they still have do homework that was assigned. Although students should work hard they still need some time to rest, relax, and just have some downtime. For example, I usually get assigned homework everyday. If I were forced to participate in extracurricular activities I'll be exhausted and I might not even turn in my homework in time.

In conclusion, I think the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities because kids have other activities to do out of school and they still need time to relax. Making students participate in extracurricular activities would overwhelm them because when students arrive home they still have to do homework and the activities happening out of school such as sports teams and dance clubs would be overlapped. A wise person once said,"Education is important but the human mind must not be too overwhelmed and stressed." Rest is important. Why take that away from people?
