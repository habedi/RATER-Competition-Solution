Is A City Without Cars

A Good Idea?

Imagine city with no cars, thats right no cars! sounds craz right, well what if i told you its real. Thats right the city

Vauban, Germany has limated the use of cars. And from what i resurched the people are living that lifestyle whith straight up happieness. but like always there are afew pros and cons to this sacrofice, like the city

Paris, France how should fallow Germany's disition on car free streets.

PROS: The reasons people are living better, is because they the kept the cars use to a minamum, which means that they have cleaner air, and thats good for the lungs. Its also good on the wallet, because you wont have to worry about spending money on gas and car repairs. Heidrun Walter said, "when I had a car I was always tence. I'm much happier this way. 'saidÂ  Heidrun Walter" (Rosenthal 3). think about the helth rates in the city

Vauban , laughter in the sreets form kids that have health lungs. and the more healthy you are the less you would have to pay bill from the doctors office.

CONS: This idea is great and all but not the best idea. But think about it, yeah you have a healthybody but your also late to work, because you dont have a car, or your wife is haveing a baby and you need to rush to the hospital quick, but then again you can't. you see cars are what gives us the abilaty to travil to places in a fast maner. most people end up needing a car at the end of things.

so to my conlution; I like the idea but is see potential flaws in the system, so I would keep cars to the equation. Its a nesesity to man-kind.
