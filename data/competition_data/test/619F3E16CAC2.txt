Many people believe that the face on Mars is an Egyptian Pharaoh. I believe that the face that appears on Mars is just a natural landform. I believe it is just a natural ladform because the text states that Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos and it revealed a photo that looked like the face was just a natural landform. I also beleive that the face is just a natural landform because the text states that on April 8, 2001, on a cloudless day, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. He took a picture using the camera's maximum resolution. The photo showed that the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the America West. I also believe that the face is just a natural landform because people thought that it could be an alien artifact but that was proven to be wrong because of the good quality cameras. This is why I believe that the face that was discovered on Mars is just a natural landform.
