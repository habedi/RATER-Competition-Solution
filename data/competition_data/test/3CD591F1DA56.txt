The world is quickly evolving and advancing, in both education and technology. However, the American school system has yet to catch up to these changes. While to the unobservant eye it may seem that all children have equal access to education, in reality, many children are unable to attend school for a myriad of reasons. One solution to this problem is distance learning, a way of learning from home through online lessons or video conferencing.Â Distance learning is an equally supplementary and beneficial way of learning, as it gives access to education to students who are unable to commute to school, provides students live assistance from teachers, and allows students with anxiety issues to have an equal opportunity to learn.

While certainly not as prominent in the U.S as much as more rural countries, where children have to hike mountains daily to reach their school, transportation is one of the biggest factors as to why some students cannot attend school. In large cities, kids may not have the funds to ride public transportation, or the ability to walk to school. Many lower class families struggle with these issues, and see schooling as something unattainable. In contrast, in more rural areas, a surplus of students cannot attend, simply due to distance. Many of these families opt for education by their parents, because they lack a means of transportation to have a more traditional education. Distance learning would be an optimal solution to this problem. Any student, despite location, would be able to receive formal education.

One reason that many children and parents shy away from homeschooling is the lack of live aid from teachers. One of the most prominent benefits from school is access to this live assistance, a much more resourceful and helpful source than the internet, which may give vague or incorrect answers. Teacher also are able to help students work through problems, and show them a method of understanding which allows them to learn material faster and better. With distance learning, the worry of losing this resource is eliminated, as the option of live video conferencing provides this much needed live assistance. Being able to communicate with a human resource is an important aspect of education, and is given through home learning.

A final reason students may be restricted from participating in regular schooling is mental issues, such as anxiety and depression. In today's society, almost one in three people have some form of mental illness, a large portion of which is anxiety or depression. One who struggles with these ailments may recoil in thought of attending a place filled with people and uncertainty. To the unaffected it may seem trivial, but these are serious issues that provide a huge detriment in learning. Once again, distance learning is a great option for these individuals. The ability to "attend" school, sans the social anxiety and fear, would seem like a golden opportunity to most. If Distance learning was implemented it would absolutely improve the attendance rate of those with mental disorders.

In conclusion, there are many, many reasons as to why someone may be unable to attend school, whether it be distance, reluctance or mental issues. Often, these people feel as if they do not have an equal opportunity as others. However, through the help of distance learning, the issues of being unable to attend because of location, the fear of missing out on live assistance, or the barrier of mental health, are solved. If distance learning was implemented in homes across the nation, there would certainly be more individuals who receive fulfilling a education.
