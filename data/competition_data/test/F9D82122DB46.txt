School activities may seem boring but they are not maybe you should try it. Many kids do a lot of after school things because they are bored at home. People should try after school sports because it can keep them bus while there parents are at work and some should do it to keep them out of trouble. Kids like to play games a lot now a days so I think after school activities wold be perfect so they wont ruin there brain.

first reason I think people Should do after school activities is because it helps kids parents out and it help the children out because they wont be distracted or bothered with games or getting in trouble. A lot of kids just sit in the house and play videos all and all its doing is ruining peoples brain its no point of sitting on a games for hours and its not helping you out in the long run. Games are making most kids who love sports and have a talent at sports sitting in the house and at junk food all day and not take baths every day. This is just the beginning why kids should do after school activities.

Second reason kids should do after school activities is because they can help kids prepare for future jobs and future sports they wanna play they might not be better than playing a game all day or hanging with your friends all day but its worth a shot. Not everyone thinks staying after school is cool or fun but its okay to be different from your peers or friends its all ways to try some new. But if you want to impress girls I bet they think a guy who is willing to try different things are more impressive than a guy who is sitting on a game all day.

Trying new things are the way to go try things you would never thought you would ever do you might acutely like it. Trying things out you thought you would never do is good because if you never do it you would never know the feeling if doing it. You might try something you said you never do but when you do it you might like it and be the best at it. These are great reasons you should always try new stuff and actives.
