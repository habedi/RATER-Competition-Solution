The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions sould be valuable. I would want to see people's different emotions from the face from the past and today. This could be a new science technology that we ever made. It's just like a math and science subject, but trying to figure out more of different people's emotions. They could be angry or happy or have any other emotions.

This technology would be great for school education, maybe in college. It could be a new subject for a science class. For these six emotions for the class, it would be a great class to pass a high school class. Doing this is pretty cool to do. Out of all the science classes and math classes it could prove that emotions for humans would be great.

That is what we should do for the future science class talking about emotions. It would be great for it to pass a science class in high school, or college.
