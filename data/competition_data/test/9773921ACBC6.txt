Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I have recently heard that your are deciding weather or not to make all students perform community service. I feel that if some student don't want to help their community why force them to.

If there are students that want to help make their community better you should let them keep doing what makes them happy and or proud. Look at it this way if you force someone to do something they wouldn't have a positive attitude about the whole process. I think since some students give back to help their community then you and or the school should give back to them. If others see that doing something positive like cleaning up litter or even tutor elementary school kids or even staying to help a teacher with some work they may need help with, then some students might get the feeling that they really want to help. I am not saying that everyone will react in the same way but I think it would be a more calmer approach, rather than trying to force a school of kids that may not want to spend extra time of their day doing more work. It will not be easy but as a teen I would say that positive feed back can really change the way people look at things. If you put yourself in a teenager's shoes you would see that some students after school really just want a break and take a load off for a couple of minutes instead of continuing working. I think to fix this problem we need one or even to positive students took set an example for our school to encourage the others to give back to the people that live around us and help us everyday in our lives by going to what every job they may have and doing what they have to do to make our lives easier and better. Thank you for your time and I hope you take my ideas into consideration.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
