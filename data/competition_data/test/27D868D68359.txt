Dear Principal,

I don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service.

It's a great thing to do for our community, but not everyone should be forced to do it.

To begin children would resent having to do it.

They wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment.

They would just be being forced to do it, so most people would hate it and either try to get out of it, or just hardly do anything.

The whole point of community service is to help out your community however, if you just have a bunch of kids there that would much rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose.

Instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be much more effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community.

Although it's sad that not all kids want to help out, their still are a good amount that would be interested.

All people are different, whether it's in appearance or personality.

They completely are different.

Some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video games all day and others would rather help out in the community.

It's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything but it's just not realistic.

All of humanity is different, if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they most likely wouldn't enjoy it.

Kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves.

Another very important reason, is that students are already so extremely busy.

If you put on another thing to do they will get stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do.

As students get older they get more and more homework and projects that they really need to focus on.

Not only that, is the fact that after school many people do various sports, arts, etc. that require a lot of their time.

At our age we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do, it's not always on people's list of priorities.

With already so much work and activities to do, adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do.

Also a lot of student are already doing a lot of community service.

People in SCHOOL_NAME a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours.

And also tons of students that go to church have to.

Anyone in SCHOOL_NAME (which is most middle school students) have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation.

It wouldn't be fair to add more to these kids and then others don't have to do as much.

Maybe a good idea, is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is.

Or even giving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards.

Doing this will make more kids that want to do community service come out and do it, instead of making people do it when they don't want to.

Students will have more fun if they have the time and want to.

It will have a much better outcome then forcing students.
