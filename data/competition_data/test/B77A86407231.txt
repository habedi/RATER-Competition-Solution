Seagoing Cowboys

Hello everyone reading this , i'm guessing your thinking " who me?? "

to answer your question yes i'm talking to you , my name is Luke Bomberger and i would love if you would join the Seagoing Cowboys , here's why.

I think that everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys because , we get to help take care of the horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas. It is also a great idea to join the Seagoing Cowboys because , the boat trips are amazing!! Especially for a small town boy like myself.

On top of that we even get to see Europe and China! If you actually think about it it is really an amazing job. I think my favorite place so far was seeing the Acropolis in Greece it was very special.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboys is going to literally change your life!! You could do everything you wanted from traveling to random places overseas , to caring for animals , we have it all! So i would recommend to stop by and sign up to become an official Seagoing Cowboy!
