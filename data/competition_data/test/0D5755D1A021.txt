At first the Electoral College is a process of compromising between election of the president by a vote in congress and by popular votes from citizens. To my opinion I could favor this as a smart compromise.

Second it goes to show that when a president gets elected and wins by popular vote by only citizens is not a good idea. Reason is that people only vote for a certain president based on not their support or ideas for america, but based on their looks. When the Electoral College comes into play, Citizens vote for a slate to pledge a candidate. Then it depends on the state.

Finally when the electors who elected the president and not the people, the citizens votes goes into a good cause. When they agree to a final vote then that candidate gets the job.

In conclusion, I think the Electoral College is a good idea becuase when an idea strikes from a candidate ,and approved by congress. Then everybody wins the vote.    Â
