advntiges, of limited car use? are you crazy there is maby only two avantiges to limited car use. people have to go to work  or pick your kid up from school or even when you go to do landry. there would be to many upset people if this was to happen. and i would drive a truck not a car. do you know how many people are going to use horses. insted of cleaning tires off the road your going to have to scrap hot horse poop off the road. more people will have to use a bike. some people cant ride a bike because there fat or have bad nees or for the pure fact they cant ride a bike.

but there is the two things whitch one is saving money on gas witch isnt a big problem its a doller and nindyfive cents then we would have to use that saved money on a bike or horse the second one would be not using that much gas witch would slow the polution make the hole in the ozone get smaller and make it not ass hot there for the ice in the south and northpole melt so i gess having limited use of a car can have its avantiges.  saving on gas and not using as much gas
