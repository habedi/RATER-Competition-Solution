Dear Senator of Florida,

Citizens and residents of the state of Florida, or "Floridians" may have an issue with the Electoral College vote. The majority of citizens and residents of this state may ask a request to change the Electoral College vote to popular vote. The reasons to why they're asking a request may be either because they're tired of it, find it unfair, or they want to try how successful the popular college vote can be when it comes to electing their president, although they don't know if their expectations might go wrong and it will be a complete chaos. Well, I personally believe that the Electoral College Vote should be kept in the state of Florida because it avoids run-off elections, and it has been practiced for the past 2 centuries and it seems it has been a success.

To begin with, the Electoral College vote should be kept because it avoids run-off elections not only in the United States but especially here, in the state of Florida. This means that the Electoral College vote avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In the article "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner Election" it states, "It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state... Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election". This quote indicates that the Electoral College vote equally distributes the states' votes to the corresponding candidate who's running for President and every amount of the state's vote counts.

I understand that the Electoral College may be consider extremely unfair and useless to some citizens and residents here in the state of Florida because of its way of processing the votes and electing the President.
