I beleive that people should join the program. I beleive in this because in this program you are going to different places to help out animals that need it or dont have a home and I would do it because I always wanted to help out animals that really needed it. Also I would join the program because it will me be a better person by helping out and getting along with the animals.

In the article it says that Luke Bomberger and his friend Don joined this program that makes you a "Seagoing Cowboy" n this programs has you help recover countries food supplies animals and also have you take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

So in conclusion I think you should do the program. Because you are helping and benefiting this earth and helping other countries with their food supply and animals like horses and young cows and even mules that were shipped overseas and thats why I think you should do the program.
