At School

Students should not do school at home because it will put them in this bubble that will make the stay at home classes feel secluded and will make them become an introverted person. I do not think that doing school from home through videos would be very effective because at school you are surrounded by people who are or have taken the same classes that you are and it is easier for you to ask for help at a school with the teachers being there.

By going to an actual school you would be experiencing everything that someone who goes to a school would. You would be physically sitting in the same class with your classmates. You get to know your classmates, build friendships, and relationships with the people that you meet. You will get to know your teacher in person and get to physically ask them questions in person. If I did school from i would miss out on a lot because I would be by myself and I would have no friends in my class. I would also have to meet people from outside or from different events having to do with school.

Another reason to go to school is that by going to a school you gain so many things, one of them being skills. Some skills that you gain would be communication skills. Being able to communicate is really important; not just in school but outside in the real world too.

At school you have to do projects, talk to classmates about school work or about school in general. later, after school the kids who did school from home our most likely going to go to a college where they don't offer the same things by providing video conferences and other things having to do with doing school online. They are not going to be used to being in the same room learning the same things with multiple people. For the kids who did go to school, it won't be a big transition for them because going to college will be the same as going to a high school. The only difference is that college is a higher level course and you have to start over and meet new people.

Some people may argue that learning from home is more effective and beneficial because it takes away distractions and it will help their kid become more independent. However, I still think that going to school is more beneficial because being at a school, you are surrounded by people who have taken the same classes and your teachers will be there physically so that you can ask them questions and build friendships with them and your classmates. You can also become an independent person at school because you have to be able to speak up for yourself, ask for help. Me, going to a school i have to become independent now that i'm growing up. I have to ask for help and be able to do things on my own.

Going to school is a great way to get to know a lot of people that you might not meet by random. A school offers a lot of different things, such as clubs, volunteer opportunities, and the chance to be on a sports team. If you did school from home you'd have to get permission and would have to do have your grades be good enough to participate. At home you are reliable for understanding the information that you are receiving from the videos and if you have a question you have to email or get a tutor because sometimes the teacher isn't available and you'd have to go off the notes you took and the videos that are available to you online. Therefore, going to a school is more beneficial because it has more opportunities to offer you and people to learn from in one building.
