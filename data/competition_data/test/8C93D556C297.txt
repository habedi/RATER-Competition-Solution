Have you ever wanted a computer that can read your emotions ? Yes right? Me too. Its good to have a computer that can read your emotions because if its teaching a lesson in a boring way it can change it and make it a little more interesting. Second, it will detect your emotion and know what you like and what you don't like. Third, it will know when your happy or sad and it will know what to put on your screen.

First, it will change the mood of the lesson if you're getting bored. This is great because now the lessons won't be so boring and you will actually do them.

You will learn faster if you like the way they teach. In the text it say

" ' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ' Dr. Huang predicts.' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor' "

( paragraph 6, D'Alto). This states that if the student is getting confused or bored the computer can modify's the lesson and the lesson will be better.

Second, the computer will detect if you like or not like what you're watching. For example, if the video you're given isn't a good one and you really don't like it then the computer can change it and give you a better suggestion. Also, the computer will understand how some people only express with emotions. " ' The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive - for video games or surgery. ' Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, ' notes Dr. Huang. ' So computers need to understand that, too " (paragraph 6, D'Alto ). This explains how computer can undertand when you like something and also how they need to understand that most communication is used my emotios or expressions.

Third, it detects if you're happy or sad. If you're happy it will make sure to keep you like that but if you're sad it might play you something so you can cheer up and do your work. Its difficult to do your work when you're sad , when you're sad you don't even want to work. "Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar add will follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"(paragraph 6, D'Alto ). This supports my reason because it talks about how the computer knows when you're sad or happy.

In conlcusion, having a computer that can read your emotions wouldn't be bad to have in a classroom. I think they will make the classrooms a litltle bit better. First, because if the student is getting bored the computer can modify the lesson. Second, because it can detect what you do and don't like. Last, because it will detect when you're happy or sad.
