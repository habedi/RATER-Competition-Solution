The Face on Mars is a mesa found on Mars in 1976. NASA's Viking 1 space craft was snapping pictures to find somewhere for it's sister spacecraft ,Viking 2 when is saw this figure/face. On April 5, 1998 MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper. It just revealed it to be a natural landform.

After taking the picture they saw no alien monument. They decided to take another picture just to clarify. On April 8, 2001 Malin's team captured a picture using maximum resolution. Each pixel was 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel which is the best they could have done in that time. If there were any form of alien artifacts or anything like that we would have seen it. The picture actually shows a form of a butte or mesa. They are landforms Common around the American West.

They have done other research to try and prove that there is no alien activity. Why would they lie? Defenders of the NASA budget specifically said they wished there were an ancient civilization. Typically if someone has an opinion of something they try to fight the opposing side. So why would NASA lie if they weren't against what the American people had to say?
