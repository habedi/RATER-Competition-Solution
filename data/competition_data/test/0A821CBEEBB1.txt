Ever been too sick to be at school and you miss a lot of work or you feel that sitting in school hours a day wastes too much of your time? Imagine being able to do all your school work from home. Some schools offer distance learning for students online or on a video chat, which I think would be very convenient.

There are times when students get too sick to even leave the house; reasons could be they are contagious and don't want anyone else getting sick or not even being able to leave their own bed. One thing about being sick at home is students will definitely miss work from school, grades might even drop and they will not even be ready to take any exams or tests because they have not learned the material yet. Being on a video chat with the teacher could feel like the student is there and actually able to see what new lessons they need to learn. The student could ask the teacher any questions he or she might have and participate in the classroom. Video chats would also save sick students from a bunch of extra work stacking up and they will be less likely to have their grades drop from an A to a C.

What about students who just don't want to go to school because seven or more hours a day just feels like its too much or have other important responsibilities?

They might work two jobs or have to stay home with their sick mother and going to school will just crunch up their day making it harder to breathe and take a break. Online classes could save the student time and money, so that he or she could get more done in one day. They could get a break from having to be transported to and from school, which takes time out of their day as well. But having online classes could mean that there are times when the student might just give up because there isn't any teacher that could collect the work which could lead to slacking off and becoming lazy. There could be an easy solution to that problem too, having online due dates will keep the student from not getting their work done and not learning.

In the end, students go to school to learn but the same could be done at home. For whatever reason any student might have they will still be picking up new information and have more convenience in their life with video chatting or online classes.
