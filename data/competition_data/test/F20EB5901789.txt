dear TEACHER_NAME

I believe we should use policy 2 my reason why. well first off our school already use the phones either way if you say yes or no. we use them out in the hallways in class or even lunch and P.E. so either way which ever policy them may pick we will always use them. so we should just leave it the way it is and leave it be.

For my reason why not to go with policy 1 is because if you were to let the students use there phones you would have them off task. then they would think it would be ok for them to pull out there i pods so they can listen to music. Another example is that drama would float around school faster because people would text other people saying something about someone else and then the school has a fight in their hands. then you would have people losing their phones and more drama would come of that. so if anything policy 2 should be considered.

So if anything i believe the phones should just be put away until after school. thank you TEACHER_NAME for taking the time to firmly read this letter. so just stick with policy 2. i mean after all we all kids have to use our time wisely while in class. a phone would only cause a detraction to you and everyone in the class.

If anything to support my detail go up to a student or even a class and ask how many student use there in school and maybe 80 % of the class will raise there hands. if that is not enough proof go to the office and see how many phones have been taken from students. so just like i said before either way you put it students will always use there phones. but if i had a choice we wouldn't use them at all. so once again thank you TEACHER_NAME for taking your time to read this and i hope you understand where I'm coming from.
