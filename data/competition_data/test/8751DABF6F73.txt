Students should be able to pick anything they want to do for the school. First, I think its better for the students to do something educational is because most of the teachers in the school have papers to grade and stuff like that. It would give the teachers a break from extra things they dont need. I feel like if you sign up for something school related then its showing that you really care about the school and actually wanna help people. Helping out other teachers and staff members are good ways to help the school.

Secondly, the students that are athletes in their school can also play for the school so that the teachers and the staff members can see that other people like representing their school and they feel comfortable at this school. I love playing sports but its different for some schools that dont have any sports at their school. As you get older your mindset changes and it may become easier because you know what you want to do in the future. Yearbook or student council are 2 good ways to start off your career because if you start drawing or something in the yearbook you might want to become an artist.

Students Council is a hard job for the school but is a way to make yourself organized and prepare for challenges. Other Students in your school might want to run for students council and u might not have a chance to be able to have that position. It might be a little heartbreaking if someone else gets the position and you dont because you really thought that you were the best at it. Student council is a hard job because its different from all the other ones. you have to go from point A to point B to point C all around the building. Imagine if they make you do that all day your going to be stressed,tired, and hungry.

Thirdly, their are some kids that want one of those jobs but they cant get them because the principal said that you have to have good grade and all of your work done. That is a disappointment because it makes you think to yourself like why didnt i get this job/part maybe i should start doing better and maybe i can get the job by the end of the year or marking period. Students might not understand if they get the job/part they're gonna get money but since its just for the school its basically like participation for other job that teachers need to do.

Lastly. i think that its a great idea because it give students a chance to prove the staff members and teachers that they are actually good at something. The only thing that i thikn that im good at is doing flips and stuff like that. i have a little talent of srawing but im not the best. If i could show my teachers and my staff memebers what i can do then i would. maybe they would let me do it some day. Another way you start jobs and see if your good at something is like going to a barbershop and sweeping up the hair for people and excel in it.
