Dear Principle,

I think students should not be required to do community service. Though i do think they should be able to do it for extra credit. I think this because if the do not want to do the work then they should not be made to.

For example if a student had something to do or a job to go to then they wouldn't have time to do community service. Maybe a student just doesn't want to do community service then again they shouldn't be made to do it.

Though if a student is behind in a class they should be able to do community service for extra credit if they want to. Also if a student wants to have community service but on there college application they should be able to do that as well.

In conclusion i would like to say once again that i don't think students should be made to do community service, though they should have the option of doing it for extra credit. Thank you for your time to listen to my opinionated letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
