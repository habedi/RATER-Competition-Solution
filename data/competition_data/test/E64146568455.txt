There are many advantages of limiting car use. Have you ever thought of just how much gas we use and how bad it is for our air. All the driving we do as teenagers is a way of showing our freedom for most, others just need a ride. I drive myself but i do have to say i couldnt give up my car, i dont live close enough to anywhere so that i could ride a bike or walk, otherwise its a great idea. Some advantages are not as much greenhouse gasses are emmitted into the air.

I also see that without driving some can get more excersize that is well needed and it also gives people the chance to see the things they dont see everyday because they are in such a hurry. It can aslo help use save our resources that have been having shotages. In america not many people are worried about driving and getting thier liscences as there use to be. Another advantage is that we can save money that could be used for other things.

Some places are having days rthat people cannot drive and if caught the get fined. I think its neat seein g a community coming together and doing stuff together. It shows just how are humanaty works. Anothe advantage iss that you can slow down, and see those around you that you havent seen before or in a while. I could go a day without driving, maybe even two. Could you ?
