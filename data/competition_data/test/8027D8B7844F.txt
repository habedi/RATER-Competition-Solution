The principal should let students have there phone during free times because they might have missed a class time thinking about something else and then when they go back to that class they will not know what to do. then when a test comes up they will not know and then they will fail the test .

But if they do let them have there phones out during there free time and there know class periods going on they can call or text there friends and see what was there home work or what they did during in that class period if they were not following along. That would be there fault.

If they could have there cell phones they might not because they can ask there friends to explain it to them if they later at lunch or to see if they can go there house later to have them show it to them and then they can text or call there parents to see if they can go or not and they can then the parents can call the school then the kids can go home with a friend to have them show what to do and what they did during class time.

Then the students can talk to there friends to see what has been going and to see if they want to meet somewhere for they can talk and to see what they have been doing all day and see if they had a good day or a bad day in school so far. so that's what they should do because they students are hurting the class time and there education so why not there still following along in class there still learning and what need to know about what was going on in this world. and learn every thing they need to know . plus if do not then buddies they might tell them what they want to them but they don't they might not following along in class because there wondering about there going to say during and not follow along.

i think this should be the policy because it could help out a lot with them
