Driverless cars soon to come

I think it would be a good idea to have driverless cars, because think about this someone could have a disablitiy and get no where, with the driverless cars they could get anywhere they need to. Cheeper on fuel, I think it would have a huge inpact in life today. The technology today is growing and growing. And with the technology this gerneration has, why not try something bigger and newer. Something that would be amazing, you can think about it in many ways. The ways I think about the new idea of the driverless cars, well I think it would be a really good idea.

The cars we have in this generation already have the sensors when we are backing up and are close to something that we may hit, we have the anitlock brakes, if someon eis texting on the phone, or not paying attention to the road, or just anything that could make us get into a car wreck. The anitlock breaks will stop it. In the matter of the seconds your life will flash before your eyes.

I have watched many movies where the taix cab driver has almost wrecked with you in the car because of talking on the phone. And the taxi cab driver dropped someone off at their house and now they know where you live now. Does it never concern you about that? Well it concerns me. I think if we got the driverless cars, we would a lot safer but that my position about them.
