Dear Principle,

Community service is an important event. It is a nice thing to do for others. Some people aren't fortunate enough to have the things that others have. I think you should make the students perform at least one community service act. It will teach them many things such as leadership and responsibility.

Students should help others because that could be them and if it was they would want someone to do the same for them. Some people think that community service is boring and a waste of time. The truth is it's really not . It's not just helping others it's taking care of the planet. Who wants to live where there is trash everywhere?

I know i don't. I think you should make students do at least one community service effort whether it's helping somebody in need or picking trash up off the highway. This could teach students how to be helpful and responsible for their community.

Community service is not a waste of time. It helps not only people but the planet too. A community service act could be as little as picking the trash up at a local park. Community service is a nice thing to do.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
