Dear Principal,

Grades are very important now a days and should have a huge impact on our lives, but there's no reason that the school policy should be changed so that students with a B average can only play sports or be involved with activities. That should not be the schools decision to make this policy. If a student doesn't get good grades then let the student and the parent talk about weather or not that student should play sports, or be involved in other extra activities.

Many students, are very smart when it comes to getting grades.

Most sports coaches tell there participants that if they don't get good grades, or earn there good grades then they don't deserve to play on that team, because it's not fair to the other athletics that do work hard to get good grades. Student's may try as hard as they can in a classroom, and study as much as possible, but that doesn't mean there always going to get good grades. Some students don't have to study to get the good grades they get. Where with other kids they have to study, and study, and study and maybe still don't understand what there learning about.

In school, instead of having the extra activities go on during school hours, let the group meet before school, or even after school where they will have more time to discuss their ideas. Even they could meet on the weekends or get together on the weekends and discuss there ideas that they might have. A student should not be punished in this way for there grades.

Most students, don't have the same way of learning things. Some students may be hearing learners where they hear one thing and can remember it just like that, where other's may need to see what there working on and maybe still don't understand it that well. Not all of the students brains function the same way. Some might be fast learners, where others are slow learners and you can't hold that against the kid.

I do know that if a student has any grade lower then a C- that student should not be allowed to be on a sports team, or involved with the team until they bring there grade up to a C. Grades are very important don't get me wrong, but student's need to have a free life outside of school also. They come to school five days a week for more then thirty-five hours. These students get bored out of there mind. I would rather see these students have a C average and be out on the sports field playing sports then to see these kids out along the streets getting involved with drugs and other substances that could harm there body.

Those are the reasons that I find most important why students who get C average grades should be allowed to participate in sports, and other school activities. Students should not be punished in that way for the grades that they get.

Signed,

Very Concerned Student.
