Technology cannot read emotinal expresseions because they are not acctually there and they are not humans .Technology is an electronic that is programed to do certain things. It is not to show u if that person is happy,sad,mad etc... You could figue it out by just looking and reding that person.

Some people may have different oppinions of what emotion the picture has but technology will not tell u what emotion something is you would have to figure it out on your own. As stated in the article "In fact,we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance ,you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. So that shows that a person can tell if something is wrong with a friend or whoever else most likely .

In conclusion,Technology will not give you answers on how someone feels and their emotions. Only another person can tell if you are or not by the way you look ,or if that person tells u that they are sad,mad,happy nervous etc...
