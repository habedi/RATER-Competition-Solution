I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it's a fun and exciting program.

The text states,"The cattle-boat trips were and unbelievable opportunity for a benefiy of seeing Europe and China."

The text also states,"But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says.

So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."

Another reason to join the program is you get to learn a lot of interesting stuff.

The text states,"Luke served as a night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour."

The text also states,"But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

One final reason to join the program is because if you like dangerous stuff the program is dangerous.

The text states,"Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of craked ribs."

Those reasons are why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
