Vauban, Germany is the very first suburban community that generally forbids street parking, driveways, and home garages. By this community having a completly "car-free" zone they are contributing in preventing more pollution. If there was a thousand communitys with car restrictions like these it would impact the enviroment at an astanishing rate. Humans have been centered around cars since WWII imagine the amount of pollution we have created on the earth.

Paris is another city that has banned driving due to smog. They have issued a partial ban to clear the largly populated city of intensifying smog. By making the partial ban it has redused the amount of smog by 6o% and rivaled the most polluted city Beijing. Limiting car usages isn't as hard you think and for people to contribute it gets others involved.

In conclusion driving cool cars is what every man wants to do but it can have terrible effects on the earth.
