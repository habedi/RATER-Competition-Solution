I disagree because a lot of people do not like to do activity and a lot people are not alike some people maybe love doing activity some people maybe feel not a type person to do activity and the principal should not decide for other people and cant force others to do an activity they dont feel right with that type of activity the principal should let them decide for themselves, so they can think and say am i ready for this type activity and should i do or am i doing it because i got force to the students should feel like they not being pressured to do stuff some kids do not like sport because sports are not for everybody and working on the yearbook is not for every it is for certain people like sports and being student council and how i want others support me position is i want them to understand not everybody is ready for sport and other stuff like that it say process to do thing that your mind decide for what best for your strength and the details i would like to share is some people might not like sports because there healthy care some people might not be a good helper working on the yearbook some others might not get what it take to be student council be other kids that dont fit in with sport and other things are always good at other things and can always try out for sport and stuff when there for and i agree how the principal feel about getting them out to do something like sports to get them out of trouble and caring for them but decide for them is not a type a thing to like let the students to decide whats best for them selves like im going use this as a example what if i was a principal and i decide all the students to do sports and work on the yearbook couple of them be student council what i will do have a some pick what they feel good at and they wont feel bad or dislike there principal as in other way there to say it like every students who feel good at these type of stuff sign up
