Natures Faces

There are many reason to why the face is just a logical thing that can happen. It could've been buttes or mesa landforms that are located in the American West. Also, there is no reason NASA would have for trying to hide something so major from the world. Lastly, if their was aliens on mars, wouldn't their be more evidence supporting the aliens instead of nothing?

Garvin from Mars Global Surveyor, talks about how it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho as stated in paragraph 12. Anyone could go to Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho and see for themselves if they look alike. A simple way to put it is that their are so many things this "face" could've been other than aliens. Which is why most people don't believe in this "theory" because it is far from practical.

Although NASA could hide what they saw at Mars, why would they? There is no reason for NASA to keep anything they discover a secret, or try and hide anything from us. NASA wouldn't have even shared the photo if they felt that they didn't want for anyone to know, to stir up this controversy in the first place! The astronauts were most likely just as shocked as we were when they saw the image.

Lastly, there isn't enough evidence to infer that there is any type of life form on Mars. In paragraph 9 of the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," it talks about how it isn't easy to target where the face is. If the face was a form of life there would be more, and it probably wouldn't be so hard to find. Most likely there wouldn't be one face but many.

Even with every fact in the world there are still the great questions we all have from time to time. Even with the facts we all know about. Though I think that there is no possible way there could be any existence on Earth. You could always say "what if." Which is why I hope you take my words into accountance when you think about the face on mars.
