Dear Principal

I Think That Its Good For Kids To Perform Community Service To Help Save Our World , I Believe That If You Help Others They Will Help You Back But That's How I Feel You May Not Feel We Have Enough Money To Help Others But I See That If We Believe In Other Selves We Can Do Alot Of Things About Earth The Place We In On The Thing We Call Earth .

Helping Others Will Get Us So Far In Life Because That's Our Time In The Furture When Our Kids In School And They See A Picture Of Us Helping Others They Will Want To Do The Same They Don't Want To Feel Like Our World Is Suffering From What Our World Have Bein Through And We Don't Want That Do We Aleast We Can Feel Good And Say I Feel So Proud We Helped Others As A Kid Now Their Going To Help Us And Plant Food , Clean Our Beaches , Stoping The Population And Making It A Good Citie And Furthermore.

If It Wasn't For Others Taking The Time Out Of Their Plans Our World Would Be A Mess , Treat Our World As Its Your World Not Just A Dump Of Waste Live Laugh Love Earth And It Would Make You And Others Very Happy Our World Is Nothing To Play With When Were Going Through Hard Times Maybe If We Keep Our World Cleaned And Wasted Free Maybe Money Will Get Batter Please Save And Recycle Paper , Bottles , Caps , Cans Anything So We Can Save Trees.

You And Your Friend Can Have The Chance To Have Fun And Hang Out At The Same Time On A Boring Weekend Your Not Doing Anything Take Advantage Of What Your Doing For You , Your Friends , Family And Most Of All Our Earth Its Nothing Better To Love Your Earth Clean As We All Can Remember It.

To Save Our World Please Do The Right Things And Have Fun With The Things You Are Doing , And Not The Wrong Things That Would Hurt Us And Our World Even More.
