The summer project is something that often looms over the minds' of students. We often find students bellyaching about how they are missing out on fun summer activities. More often than not, it is the teachers who assign the projects, and even though teachers are more educated on certain subjects, it would be appropriate to believe that students should design summer projects. This sort of activity over the summer would promote individuality, entrepreneurship, and personal responsibility.

Some people think that individuality is not necessary in an industrial world, but really, it is the backbone of this nation and student designed projects promote such individuality. In the long term, individuality leads to higher paying jobs in the future. It is well known that if more people have high paying jobs, there will be less homelessness and a stimulated economy. As well, creativity stems from a sense of individuality. Fine arts are the future of the world as we are getting closer to not needing hard labor. The arts also jump startÂ economic progress by putting more money into the system. All this individuality leads to entrepreneurship.

There is an argument to be made that not all students will be entrepreneurs, but it is important to nurture entrepreneurial practices, which can be done through aforementioned student designed projects. Entrepreneurs tend to be better off in the real world. This may sound repetitive, but we really need more people with big ideas so that the world can progress. The loss of this kind of person means the loss of all those years spent building the world from the ground up. As well, the process of designing a project could lead to students designing a business in the future. The process for creating such projects is quite involved, and it leads to more focused adults in the future. In reality though, none of this would be possible without a sense of personal responsibility.

Many people in this modern world believe that the only way to become more responsible is to get a job, and while this is partially accurate, projects such as this will always nurture responsibility. For example, completion of projects lead to the student feeling more accomplished. That sense of accomplishment make students feel like accomplishing more will make them feel even better, leading to them being more responsible with projects in their future. As well, project planning in youth will lead to the individual taking charge within projects in their future. It is important to have students be proactive in their career as it will likely lead to better positions and better pay.

To finish, responsibility will only develop if you let your student take charge, be it in a career or in a project. While some people may disagree, this is the truth, hard work cannot do all the heavy lifting. As a country we need to develop our youths' sense of entrepreneurship,individuality, and personal responsibility or else we will not progress as a people.
