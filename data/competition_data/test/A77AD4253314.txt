Dear State Senator,

I favor on changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is time for change to our voting system. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. five reasons for retaining the electoral college is, the certainty of the outcome, anyones president, swing states, huge states, and avoidment of run-off elections. The first reason is, inÂ  2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vot when romney only got 51.3 percent. the peoples popular vote wanted romney to win. I beleive it isnt fair that the electoral vote has the final say, there is more of the U.S citizens than the electoral college. The second reason is, the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trnasreginal appeal. residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isnt thir president. The third reason is, swing states. voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, so the most thoughtful voters should be the ones who decides the election. The fourth reason is big states get more attention from from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state which isnt fair or equal. the electoral college favorites of of bigger states. the fifth and last reason is that the electoral college avoids the problemof elections. The electoral college method of selecting the president, may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying there state. voters in the U.S presidential election are people who are exspressing a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.
