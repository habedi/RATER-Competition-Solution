Hello, I am here to tell you why I believe that people participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that would be a good way to see the world and go place you never been before and you can go over seas and help other countries in need.

In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves it state in paragraph 4, in World War two over in Europe and many other places they was left in ruins so 44 nations joined togethere to form a UURRA and they hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the animals they was shipping over seas. That is why I believe participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good thing cause you can help other countrys in need.

In the story it sate i paragraph 6 that the boy Luke that was in the Seagoing Program he was over seas for two weeks before he had got to china. That is one of the reason why i think that being in the Seagoing Cowboys is a good way for you to go places you never been before

Last, the passage state in paragraph 9 that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that a adventure for Luke Bomberger. This is why I choose to think that it is a great idea to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program cause you can see stuff that you never in your life seen before and have adventures.

This shows why I have stick to believe that it is good idea for people to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
