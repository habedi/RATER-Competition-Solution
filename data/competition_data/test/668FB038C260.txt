Dear Principal,

An issue has come forward involving our fellow classmates. Should we or should we not be required to take part in community service? I think we should, and here are my reasons why. First, if you walk outside, and see litter over our beautiful grass, would you not want it to be clean? Would you like a big pile of trash on your lawn? I think not. Therefore, I think to make the world a better, and more cleaner environment, we should have kids our age helping out! Another reason why we should be required to be in the service is because it teaches us lessons. Nowadays, you see kids under the wrong influence of people. I believe that if we all work together to achieve something, we will see our wrongs and we would want to change. We hang out with the wrong people sometimes, and when kids work together, I noticed, we seem happier and more gentle working for something that will make us feel better in the future. Looking back at our memories, I believe that we will feel a sense of pride and a need to spread this good-willing service to our community. Another reason is that it will keep teenagers out of trouble. If, let's say, a boy robbed something. Is it better to shove him into a juvenile jail, lock him up, while he does nothing with his life? Instead, a good option would be making him work for the community. Like I stated before, it changes people. You can see right away, it makes us feel good. Like we are doing something with our lives. I believe that helping out our community will truly change the way we see our world. How we act, and how we care for our environment. Requiring to help in community service makes us proud that we are becoming a better person, helping others out. I believe that it also boosts self esteem up by a great difference. You see kids getting rejected by 'cool' teenagers everywhere, being bullied, harassed, and even feeling the need to not live anymore. Helping others, caring for others, will surely lift their self esteem, and they will feel not scared to live, but proud to be living and helping others while doing so. In the process of the volunteer work, I think that they will find such confidence in themselves, they will start to come out of their shell, and find a great person lying beneath there. Someone who helps others and likes feeling good. And the bullies? I believe they should also be required to help out with service. Deep inside, bullies are just scared little kids who don't have anything to live for, or their lives are so bad, they take it out on innocent people. What they don't see is the damage they do internally. Helping others, the opposite of what they do, will be a lifelong lesson that they will forever remember. I believe that if they volunteer at, for example, an orphanage, they will see their victims true side. Not a wimp, or a loser, or whatever names they call them. But a human, a person that has hopes and dreams like everyone has. Even themselves! This will give them a new sense of clarity, a need to apologize to their victims, and a need to help out more, discovering new ways to do good in their lives. In the process, they too can change, become more humble, and become a better person.

In conclusion, I hope you take the time to consider this letter, to make the hard decision of requiring the community service for your students. I believe you will make the right decision, and that you will ponder the good qualities of how we might change the world by helping out. Consider this question. What is this world coming to? Do we want the society we have now? Or would we like to make the world a better place by helping others, and changing in a good way to become a better person. Thank you for reading this, and I hope you will side with me and help us become good, educated, and caring students.

-Sincerely,
