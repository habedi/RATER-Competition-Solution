Act now before it's to late. The problem is getting worse than before.''70% of Vauban's familes don't own cars''.We buy cars for no reason. Just to impress girls or to look cool. Me my self i use a bike to go places. I'm not polluting the air or causing mother nature any problems.

Were on the job! People are actually doing something about this crisis. Car pollution is increasing because more people are buying cars. So that means people need to stop driving and find a new transportation like bikes.''Almost 4,000 drivers were fined,according to Reuters''.It's about time people start caring for this world.

In Colombia they have a car free day. That's not a bad idea matter fact we should take that to consederation in the United State Of America. Places like Colombia are trying to reduce smog from cars to prevent bad air. With that the traffic won't be jam and less car accidents will happen. So that means less death rates from cars will occur.

So try helping to reduce greenhouse gas. Be mindful next time when you are going somewere use something else then a car. Don't abusse the prevelage. One step at a time. Anything you put your mind to you can conquer. Just belive in you. You could do it.
