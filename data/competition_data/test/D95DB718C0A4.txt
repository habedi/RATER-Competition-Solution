Dear Principal,

I am glad that you want students to have good grades to be able to play in sports and other school activities.

I do not agree that us students should have a B average to participate.

Some students can only get as far as a C average.

The lowest average us students should have is a C average.

It would be unfair to only let B average students participate in recreational activities because not everyone is great at school but they do look forward to being active and healthy.

We should be able to take part in these activities because a C average is passing grade average.

We should be allowed to play sports or join clubs as long as we have a passing average.

I disagree with this policy that we must have at least a B average.

C average is a passing average.

We should be able to have as low as a C average.

More people would be able to participate if it was a C average instead of a B average. Thank you for your time.
