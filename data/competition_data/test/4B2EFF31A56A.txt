Dear Principal,

All students should perform community service if they want a better place to live . As you can see our community is becoming a junk pile. Our community wouldn't be in a bad looking community if it wasn't for people littering. If there wasn't community service, do you think people would be recycling? I think it would make our community even more dirty if we didn't have community service. May be if we gave out prizes many people would help. But kids the most are the ones that need to help our community because they are good when it comes down to littering. Some may think that community service takes up time. But if you think about it why wouldn't you help your community if you know no its going to look disgusting. You know you may have littered one time or more and somebody else picked up your dirty work. What if someone from an different community comes to your community and talks about how dirty it is and how clean theirs is. Wouldn't you feel embarrassed ? I know i would. getting students to help our community recycle is a good thing. It would make our environment a much safe and better place.

P.S Thanks for taking time out of your day to read my letter. I truly appreciate it!

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
