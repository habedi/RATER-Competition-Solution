Venus is an intresting planet in our solar system. This soarching planet can reach extreamly high temperatures;and conditions of this planet are dangerous. That being said its hard to believe is reffered to as Earth's "twin?" Well, believe it or not Earth and Venus share more similarities than you may think. In the artical "The Challenege of exploring Venus," The author suggests that despite Venus's conditions, we should be trying to expore this planet and be more educated on it. The author of this artical did make a few valid arguements as to why we should be more willing to take a risks to find out more information about this firery hot planet.

First, lets start with a run down of Venus's charaterisics that mimic Earths. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density. In some circumstances Venus is acutaly closest in distance too, depending on their differences in speed. Astronomers are fascinated in Venus because they think it may have been more of an "Earth-like plantet" long ago. They think Venus was probably covered with oceans. The planet surface itself has rocky sediment and includes similar features like valleys, mountains, and craters.

As to why we havent gone to the planet before and the risks; for starters Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97 percernt carbon dioxide blankets. It has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperatures can reach all the way up 800 dergrees farenheit, and the atmospheric peressure is 90 times greater than we experience on Earth. Venus also has been known to have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes, and no spacecraft has survived the landing to Venus for mor than a few hours.

In concusion to reading the artical, i think we should be furthering our research on Venus. Venus could have supported various life forms before, and we want to know how Venus got the way it is now. How could we do that? NASA has an idea that we could possibly float above Venus to avoid the hostil conditions, but even then it would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be closer to sea levels, and the radtion wouldnt exceed the Earths's levels. Even then, there would still be limited reaserch on the ground conditions because most forms of light cant get through the thick atmoshere, which means we cant use stadard forms of phtography and videography, and we wouldnt be able to take samples of rock, gas or anything else. Nasa is however working on some simplified electronics made of silicon carbine, and have been tested in chambers simulated Venus's surface and have lasted up to three weeks in these conditions. I think we could learn more about our "twin" planet, and it would be nice to have the reasearch done and acutally be educated on Venus.
