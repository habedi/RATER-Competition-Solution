Summer is a time period students dream about throughout the school year. It is the promise of complete freedom from the academic cycle they grow exhausted of over time. While summer project assignments may be dreaded by some to inhibit them during their months of freedom, these assignments have the long termÂ benefit of continuing to engage student minds. Teacher-designed summer projects guide students to continue learning effective content based on the educators' experience, and though more demanding than student-designed projects, ultimately prepares them for the future.

Unlike students, who have no experience in teaching a course, teachers have the knowledge to assign projects that not only directly relate to the classwork, but specifically assist students in mentally preparing for the rigor and content of the coming year. Teachers have firsthand experience in assigning projects, as well as knowledge gained through formal training to receive their teaching certification. Specifically, they know how their class will be lead and therefore have the deepest understanding of what content would be most effectively to learn or review over the summer. The time students spend on teacher-designed summer projects would assist their position in the class even before the academic year has begun. Oppositely, student-designed projects have the potential issue of being mere busy work, meant to be simple to complete yet not informed by the actual course, and subsequently a poor use of students' time and effort. Teacher-designed summer projects are guaranteed to be effective in enhancing student learning, as they are lead by the educators themselves.

Teacher-designed summer projects have the educational advantage of being assigned directly by the leader of the course. This then gives students the advantage of getting to know their future teacher's expectations for the class and the content they are expected to know. This may lead to lessened student anxiety surrounding beginning a new school year by providing them with a sample of coursework. Summer projects may involve a rubric for scoring, as they often do for academic year assignments. This allows students to have teacher expectations written out for them so that they can mentally prepare for the coming year at their own pace. Summer projects designed by teachers may also mirror an assessment that will be given the first week or two of school. A practice test, for instance, gives students firsthand experience in what questions will be asked. This knowledge of the class, direct from the educator, provides students with concrete practice and will lower stress surrounding the unknown of the coming academic year.

Summer projects designed by teachers are likely to be more intensive than student-driven projects. But this prepares students for the reality of their futures, in which they must independently weigh work, leisure, and socialization to reach a balance for contentment and success. Students and parents may be concerned about the potential inundation of schoolwork during the promised free period of summer break. Yet, the promise of months of vacation from work is not reflective of students' lives after graduation. In the workforce, much more often then not vacations are not guaranteed. Vacation days must be earned or built up over time, and the employee must additionally consider the effect of losing that time at their occupation. The working world, the adult world, does not slow in the summer. Teachers, understanding the scope of their courses, will tailor summer projects to be educationally effective, which likely will mean more intensive work, but work which will improve student performance in the coming year. While the project itself is not student-driven, students have control in how they plan to complete the assignment. Teacher-designed summer projects mirror the students' future careers, in which the work is assigned but they have the independence to balance work with choice activities.

Teacher-designed summer projects provide students with the opportunity to use time over the summer to efficiently prepare for the course and develop skills regarding balance of work and play. Student-designed projects would not reflect the content of the course adequately, and a student-designed system does not prepare students for their lives after graduation, in which they will be expected to manage work given to them by authorities and balance their other activities. Teacher-designed summer projects have the major benefit of preparing students in both the short term and long term.
