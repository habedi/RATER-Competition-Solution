Dear principal,

I strongly agree that you should consider policy 1 because it gives kids the opportunity to have free time and to just get away from their classrooms. When we have a lunch break you can allow us to just use our phones. As an illustration you can listen to your cell phone with your headphones; enjoying the amazing music. It also gives kids free time to just get away from their classrooms. They'll have so much enthusiasm knowing that they can get their free time away from school work. They'll be listening to their hip hop music with their apple headphones. You'll see the joy on their face as you'll walk by them. Other people that you should consider policy 2, but I certainly disagree with that point of view. If you consider policy 2 you'll be making an horrible mistake. Without their phones they'll probably think you're taking away their freedom. If you consider policy 2 kids wouldn't perform as well. They'll question you, our beloved principal, and start protesting against the school. If you consider policy 1 they'll perform even better and improve in things they're not good in. Banning cell phones in school would be a disgrace to our school. Listening to the music from your phone isn't going to harm our school. If you could just let us have the freedom to have our phones at school, we'll make our school the best school in the whole state. Patrick Henry once cited "Give us liberty or give us death". I believe if you give us the liberty to have our cell phones in school it'd be wonderful. However if you chose not to that would have been like backstabbing. We guarantee that if you choose our request we'll turn them off during class. Above 75% of our school would like to choose policy 1. To sum it up, principal, you should grant us policy 1 because it gives kids the opportunity to have free time and to just get away from their classrooms.

Sincerely
