Today join the sea going cow boys as there travel around the world seeing unique places such as seeing Europe,China,Acropolis,Greece,the Panama Canal,excavated castles and much more. If you join you will sail on a cattle boat trip also this is a huge opportunity for small town boys and many more people. You will be kept busy by caring for the animals on board during the crossing. All animals must be fed watered 2 or 3 times a day. Also caring also means cleaning out the animals stalls. If that isn't enough for you then we also have challenges and tornements below deck to keep you busy when all your work is done. Also if you need something to do we always could have a night watchmen just in case one is tired we have shifts for the night watchmen so you always have a good sleep and your ready to get on the job in the morning see you soon,
