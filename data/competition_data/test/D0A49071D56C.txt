Limiting car usage has so many benifits not only for the earth but for us to. Getting rid of cars would make everyone in shape beacuse we would be walking every where. It would also lower car accident rates and the amount of pollution we breath in. If some of the worlds most polluted places like beijing and china stopped using car's their amount of smog would decrease greatly. France forbided cars due to the increase of smog and after five days without them the smog had cleared and France was back to normal. Bogota has a day without cars each year and all the people love it they say its a good way to lower stress and pollution. Recent studies show americans are buying fewer car's, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. Part of the explination is some american's can't afford cars and some don't even have job's.
