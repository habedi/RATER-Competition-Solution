I belive that these summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed. Students are able to work better if they get to design what their project should be about and have the chance to be more creative, they are also less likey to be stressed about doing it wrong. If these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing.

When students get the chance to design and pick what they can learn about for their project, they will most likely pick something that they are pasionate about. Which means that they will most likey have more information about it and have the opportunity to be more creative on the finished product. For example, if a student wanted to to bulid a model about something they like, then they will work as hard as they can to complete it to the best of their abilities. It doesn't matter what topic they choose, all that matters is that they are using their time wisley and learing about something new or learning more about something they already knew.

Having to do a project over the summer in general is stressful enough, so having a teacher get to design the kind of project students should do, would add even more stress. This stress could lead to students wanting to give up on the project and not complete it. Students are excited about summer because it means they won't have the stress of doing work for school, so if you design something that is easy and know a lot about, causes youto get it done quicker and enjoy the rest of your summer worry free.

In my opinion, I think that is would be less stressful if I could get the chance to design my own project. I wouldn't have to worry about holding up to what a teacher expects me to do and only worry about what I know i can do.

Concequently, if these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing. It limits their creativity and their work ethic. For instance, if student wanted to create a type of art work about what they learned about, they wouldn't be able to do that if a teacher got to choose the kind of design the student had to do. Students are expected to do their best and succeed, limiting them to do a specific project would only casue them to do the opposite. Students are capable of doing great things if you let them.

In conclusion, students should have the opportunity to design their own project. Letting students design their own projects would only effect them in a positve way. It would cause them to do their very best and improve their creativity. They would be less stressed about doing what a teacher expects and get the project done much quicker. Students would have more time to enjoy their summer worry free. Teacher designed projects would only limit them to what they are actually capable of doing.Â
