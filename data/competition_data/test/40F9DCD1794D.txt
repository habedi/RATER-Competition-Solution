I disagree with this because the principal shouldnt have to make everyone do at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons on students dont have to do a activity because some students might have anxiety, work around the house, or homework. Some students might have anxiety because they probably been bullied by classmates and other times they probably grew up in a rough life. Some students do work around the house like some kids live in a farm and they have to take care of animals, and some kids might babysit their siblings. The principal dont know some of the kids went through in their life. For instance, some kids probably got abused, homeless, and foster care. So the principal should ask about how they feel about they feel about the changes of the school activities. Most students dont like sports because coaches push them a lotÂ or there not interested. When a student is behind in school and they have to make up work it takes them time. Some kids dont have time for yearbook or student council. People dont like yearbook clubs because they have to work on a page and it takes days to finish. Some students cant do student council because they cant behave, focus, and be responsible. I have few more thoughts. When it comes to sports parents dont allow there child to eligible to play any sports like football because the injuries, concussions, and even deaths. Students might have body issues for sports like leukemia, and schlolisosis. So I think students doesnt have to do at least one after school activity. Some students dont have the grades to be eligible for a sport like they have 3 F's. Finally some students have to do other sports out of school like wrestling and the gym. So I think students shouldnt have to do at least one activity.
