Dear Principal,

I think that you have a grate idea, even when students even me wont have fun for some time, but i think that they will do better at school and bring their grades up. I just want them to do better and learn just like you, but leather if they get good grade you can give us our sport time as reward. I know that some kids do bad at school, but there are some that do great as well and even do I know is a team effort

I don't think that student that do good in their learning shouldn't have some time to have fun just because others don like to learn. If you take the sports out of our school is like taking a banana from a monkey because the student will lose their interest in school and then everyone will be doing poorly in their grades. I don't think we want that, we want them to do better for example: I like to do good at school, but I also like to have some fun and talk to friends at when we are not been tetched because the think that i like the most of school is that you have to respect so other will respect you the same way back.

with all my respect,

STUDENT_NAME
