The face of Mars is a landform that looks just like a face. Even though it looks like a face, it has been proven that it is just a landform and if you zoom in on it, you can tell that it isnt manmade. There are landforms on Earth that look just like the face too.

Scientists have zoomed in on the picture and have proven that the face of Mars is just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Butte's, or mesa's, are landforms common around the American West and are also on Mars. The face of Mars is just a really odd shaped butte and people have mistaken it for alien structures. The face also kind of looks like a butte called Middle Butte in Idaho. People have also said that the face looks about the same height as the Middle Butte in Idaho.

The people at NASA had the first pictures of the butte zoomed out enough that it looked like a face. The NASA camera that takes pictures of Mars is in a wierd position so it doesnt pass the face that much and when it does, its not very close so when they zoom in, the pixels are too big to see. When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.

Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up. Landforms can have all kinds of shapes and the face of Mars just has a very unique shape. In conclusion, the face of Mars is just a odd shaped Butte.
