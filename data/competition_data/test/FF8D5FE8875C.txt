You shouldn't take advantage of cars because they are bad for the environment. I understand it's good and important to have a car, but if your going to the park that is two blocks away with your kids you shouldn't go in a car; you should walk them two blocks because it's good exercise and many people do need it. Always depending on your car isn't good because one day you might not have it. Cars break down very easy and you also should be walking if your going a few blocks down. Vehicles are great but also very bad; people tend to depend on their cars to even go down the street, you should be able to walk and get the exercise you need if you don't normally exercise.

"Vauban's streets are completely "car-free" except a few streets." That's good that Vauban is trying that because you will soon realize that their wont be so many obese people and many people will be more halthier. Taking a ten minute walk isn't so bad and your exercising so it's helping your health conditions. Many believe if they don't have a car they can't go anywhere, when in reality they can they can walk their if it's not to far and if it's somewhat far then they can walk to the bus stop and take the bus.

"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." I belive that, that's good what Paris did because all that smog isn't good for the environment and is bad for people. If you work far or your gonna go grocery shopping or do many things then I understand to use a vehicle but ig your going down the street their's really no point of driving a car when you can just walk there.
