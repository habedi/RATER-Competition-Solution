I say we keep the Electoral College. For one we are not put with that pressure of a single vote from us, the people instead its like a claim to the candidate. Though some candidates in some states may seem hopeless to the people of the states though that barley happens due having a trans-regional appeal. Even if it is a bit "outdated" we have been using it for years and it hasn't had much flaws. The close vote in 2012 was won because of the votes in Florida due to its population thanks to the Electoral College. Also some people may not understand the real intents of a president, example if a potental candadate, if in their campaign the went to sent troops to war but try to cover it up by saying the area they are sending the troops in caused something or threatened the country the  then the people would side with the candidate.

It balances  out large states from small states not causing much of a arguement so you have equality. Also it depends on the state candidate who should be listen to the people of the state to help their vote. Also some people can be bias to a potental candidate and vote for him instead but with the state candidate that can't really happen. Even if the state candidate is hopeless they can still try to the the popular vote for that candidate their voting for. With those small votes they could make that candidate win. If states pay attention to candidate ads they could vote for the candidate they actually think should win for political reasons. For area the candidate know he will win he has focus on just those states so he points them out making the other states feel like that candidate doesn't care for them. Say we remove the Electoral College then people in more populated area can vote for the candidate the wish to win and they can outnumber the candidate by a whole lot.

Bottom line we need to keep the electral college.
