You should become a Seagoing Cowboy, like in the article "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" for many reasons. One reason, is that you get to help animals and people after WWII according to the text, "World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more,"(2). You get to transport animals to new areas to graze. You'd be able to help people get out of poverty.

You could also get to see places you don't usualy see. For example, "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,' he says. 'So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete"(5). Most people would never see those places in a lifetime.

Speaking of lifetimes, most people who live average lives will probably never get a chance to do this. "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy,"(5). After the job, you may never do it again.

While riding the boat, you still get time for fun activities like "Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."(8) So, you won't be completely bored while riding to the next area.

Luke(the charicter from the story) also said that "being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. 'I'm grateful for the opportunity,' he says. 'It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.' And that awareness stayed with him,"(9) So over all, you get to make memories of the places you've been, and help people and animals in need, better understanding the world around you.
