Extracurricular activities can be a fun after school experience for students. While extracurricular's are a fun experience, I do not think they should be forced onto students. Three reasons extracurricular's should not be forced include, A lack of interest, not having enough time, and extracurricular's could hurt students school performance. I personally enjoy after school activities, but some students may be effected by them more than others.

First off, Students having a lack of interest in what their doing. When people are forced to do things they have no interest in doing their work is effected. Not to mention that they often work in groups with other people so their work is effected too. The people who really enjoy what they're doing will be effected negatively by the people who don't care. When this happens people stop working together and when you're not working together as a team then everyone becomes disinterested and will not do their best work.

secondly, Students may not have a lot of time for extracurricular's. Some parents may not have time to pick up and drop off their children to these after school activities. Also, Students may participate in extracurricular's outside of school that may be effected by there school extracurricular. Students that would have to do both extracurricular's may not have time when they get home to do their school work and their home duties. This could put a lot of stress on students and they could be effected by this stress at school.

On the topic of students being stressed, Their performance in school could be negatively effected by extracurricular's. When students do not have time to do their homework at night they are forced to stay up late. Students sometimes go to sleep almost in the middle of the night and could get sleep deprived. The next day, students could be tired and falling asleep in class. When you fall asleep in class you are not paying attention to the material or doing your work and after a certain period of time of this happening your grades could start to drop.

Extracurricular's are fun activities for students when they're done with school. Extracurricular's will have a negative impact if they are forced onto students. Extracurricular's should not be forced for these three reasons, lack of interest, not having enough time, and after school activities could hurt students performance in school. To me extracurricular's are fun but they may effect some more than others.
