To the Principal,

I think you are trying to do the write thing by not allowing kids under a grade B participate in any after school sports even though most kids in this school have a C average. I feel that if you say you need to get a B average to play sports that would be the write thing to do. It's smart to make kids get better grades to participate in after school sports because if they really want to do the sports then there going to want to get better grades and to do well in school.

Its great for the school and its great for the students to get great grades.

The students that do not agree with this policy will not earn the right to play sports, so its either get good grades and play or get bad grades and not play.

You could reduce the amount of kids that do not agree with this policy maybe if you don't make it sound like a challenge and you make it sound fun to get B' s in school You could even hold an after school sports activity for getting the highest grade in your class and hold a competition amongst these students. Also good grades also lead to good behavior so that is another reason to stick with your policy. This might even make school a fun place for students who hate it or think it's boring.

In the future you should try to get students with B pluses and A' s to play in school sports so you keep pushing them to get the higher grades. I'm sure that not only will the teachers, and students feel good about there grades but so will there parents or guardians. Getting good grades is fun and its even better when you can do an after school activity because of it.

From,
