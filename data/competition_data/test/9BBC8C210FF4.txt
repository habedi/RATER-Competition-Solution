Exploring Venus comes with many limitations. "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is an example of these limitations. The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" does not show enough support towards the idea of studying Venus despite the dangers and does not use enough evidice to back his claim up.

In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author does not use enough information to support the fact that spacecrafts will last on Venus. While trying to explore Venus, Spacecrafts were sent out but they did not withstand the climate of Venus not long after landing ("The Challenge of Exploring Venus" 2). This information does not support the author's idea and would limit the studying of Venus. Although the author does explain other alternative methods to explore Venus, it is not for certain they will work ("The Challenge of Exploring Venus" 7). This shows that studying and exploring Venus may not be a worthy pursuit if their attempts in creating a spacecraft that lasts on the surface of venus does not work.

The author describes multiple reasons as to why Venus's atmosphere and climate are so dangerous and does not support the alternative methods of retrieving information from the planet using human exploration. The atmosphere of Venus consists of corrosive sulfuric acid clouds and 97 percent of the atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide. The pressure of the atmosphere on Venus is 90 times greater of what it would be on Earth and the suface of Venus can reach teperatures above 800 degrees Fahrenheit. On the surface of the planetthere are other dangerous aspects like earthquakes, volcanoes that erupt, and plentiful lightning strikes ("The Challenge of Exploring Venus" 3). The author describes multiple reasons as to why humans exploring Venus would be very challenging, if even possible, and the multiple dangers it would consist of. Researchers would not be able to get the photography, or even the samples from the surface that they need since Venus is inhabitable ("The Challenge of Exploring Venus" 6). If researchers are not able to aquire the information they need to research Venus thoroughly and without putting themselves in harms way, it shows that it is not a worthy pursuit. The author does not support his idea while explaining this.

In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author does not show enough support as to why pursuing Venus is worth studying despite the dangers. Instead, under multiple instances, the author gives all the more reason we should explore from afar. The author's idea does not get across, from describing the limitations of spacecrafts and humans to the treacherous atmosphere and climate of Venus.
