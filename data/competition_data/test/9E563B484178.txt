"Hi", I am Luke Bomberger.

I am a Seagoing Cowboy a part of the "Seagoing Cowboys" from the UNRRA

( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.)

I was not always a Seagoing Cowboy, I was actually a regular boy just graduating high school and working two part-time jobs one in a grocery store and the other at a bank.

I was doing just fine, until my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat, I couldn't say no, and he said it was an opprotunity of a lifetime so, I said, "What the heck, I'll go" and that's the begginning of how my life changed.

It was in August in 1945, when I went on my first adventure as a Seagoing cowboy, I just arrived on August 14, when the Pacific War ended and me and Don got our seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay for us to feed them.

The next day I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and I realized that I could be drafted for military service, so instead I drafted myself and by the time it was 1947, I had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy, I helped many people while stopping, but most inportantly I hope that you can also help people just how me and Don did.

So, in conclusion, just become a Seagoing Cowboy, because it opened the world up to me and gave me a grateful opportunity, and It can make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs.
