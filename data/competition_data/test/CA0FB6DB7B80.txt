I agree, with our school principal ideas, I agree that our school principal should add more afterschool activities or even better, in school activities, I also agree that all students, in Generic_School, should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think that after a long day of school, after a log day of studying hard and working hard, our principal should let students do an activity after school, such as sports, serving as a student council, and working on year books to unstress ourselves out. In my case I love playing sports so much, my biggest favorite sport is soccer, and I love it!! I think it would be woderful that our school principal decides to add a soccer activity afterschool, even tho you can run, get tired, and sweat alot by playing soccer. Soccer could be one of the best way to workout your muscles and body. And not just that, it could be one of the best ways to developed your brain, and the best way to give your brain a break from school things, such as math, science, art, mucic,civics,english,strings,etc.

As I said before, it's a great idea to have afterschool activies or in school activities. "wow". what a great way to unstress yourselves out after a long and tired day of school. Lately, most people, and student's stay after school to do an activity, but not all of the students participate in at least one activity after school or in school, some don't participate because they're parent's don't give them permission to stay after school, for at least 2 hours.

I think that parents, should give permission to their kids to stay afterschool and participate in at least one activity. It will be awesome that all students participate in an activity, even if you don't know how to play a sport or any other activities, you can learn as time goes through, you can learn by looking at other student's examples, over ad over and over again! yet I think that adding after school or in school activities, is a good way to get to know other students from different grade levels or further more, get to know different teacher's in our school, that we don't talk to, or don't get along with. By joining in afterschool or in school activities you can easily get along with other people, and who knows you can become friends or even better best friends.

As some people do this activities or play sports, others can volunteer to help in school, in whatever teacher's need help in. For example, others could work on keeping the school clean.

furthermore instead of having just sports activities, we should, or in other words the principal should decide to add more new school activities, like I said helping in school. My question is how can I help in school? well you can help in school for example,by helping the school clean. but in what ways ca I keep school clean? well one example is by keeping the school organized and neat. while other students could do other things, for example, students could participate in picking up trash that other student live during school hours.

Others can participate in keeping things organized in school such as keeping the library clean, by organizing the books by categories or by the authors, this way all students could colaborate to keep our school clean. Students should be able to colaborate in at least one thing, that way if all students colaborate and volunteer in this great idea, our school will look more organized and wonderful, not just from the outside, but from the inside too, because that way visitors or even our parent's who come to school sometimes, can notice how great our school looks like, because how our school looks like, tells other people alot about our school.

Students in our school are so helpful, as teacher's are too, our school has alot of wonderful, helpful and smart students. In my opinion I think that teachers or students cannot change the whole world, but we can change at least our school. We can make our school in to a better school, in to a a wonderful and nice school, even tho others made not like the idea of having extracurricular activities. Indo think we should have extracurricular activities,afterschool. Sometimes after a long day of school, I go home tired and bored. In my opinion that's why we should do afterschool or inschool activities, so when school ends, we can go home happy and not tired. As I said before, sports is a good way to end school and go home happy. All activities, doesn't matter if is in school or afterschool can help you alot, it entertains you and helps you take a break from school. When school ends, some people are bored, tired, sleepy, mad, sad, depressed, etc, but if our school principal adds new activities after or in school, those students that are sad, mad, depressed or tired after school, can go home happy and with a positive attitude.

Overall, in conclusion I do agree with our school principal's idea. I think teacher's and parent's should vote too, so we can have more new activities, so we can have in school or after school activities. Lets help our school! students!! Let's help teacher's and our principal decide, that way we will have new activities to do, in school and afterschool. Let's keep our school clean, beautiful, organized and a safe place to be in. Let's help our school look awesome, so when visitors come, or our parent's come to visit our school, they can say positive things and not negative things about our school. Let's be the awesome students we have always being, and I encourage you to join in our after school activities, that way we can always be happy and have a positive attitude.
