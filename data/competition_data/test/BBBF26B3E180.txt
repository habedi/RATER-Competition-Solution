I feel as if the technology is very adavnced to notice every kids face in a room. I believe it would work! If the technology can work on a masterpiece from centuries ago, why wouldn't it work on a couple of students?

In the text it says " By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions". A classroom full of kids is at the huighest, 31. I do believe that the technology can do just that. "Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness." A classroom has more than six people in it. So the technology is more than advanced.

To conclude, the FACS can notice every muscle in your face. The technology is so strong! "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles." It can focus on all 25 to 30 children faces at once. The technology will work on the kids in the classroom.
