Seagoing Cowboys

Just like Luke people should become seagoing Cowboys.

People should join this force because it's fun not only fun it helps you explore the world, like New Orleans, Greece , Venice, and even China. I'm sure there is many more places Luke visited and just didn't talk about.

Boeing a seagoing cowboy isn't always about fun and games. Sure that's one thing but it's also a duty. It's a duty to get you're animals from one country to another, or farmers wouldn't have cattle, butchers wouldn't have cows,etc. but without them some countries wouldn't have cows, mules, and horses. Even know it's a duty seagoing cows are always helping in they're own way. They get animals from one place to another but they are also kind. I'm sure if someone was having a bad day and to pick up a horse, the seagoing Cowboys were there to help.

So please take this information and spread it to others we need more seagoing Cowboys. They are important, thank you for reading. And take my advice and become a seagoing cowboy with your own free will.
