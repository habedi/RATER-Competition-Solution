policy 1: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period.......

reason 1: students here at SCHOOL_NAME would still bring cell phones to school any way why not let them bring them and let them us it during recesses and free times.

reason 2: in class they wont be so busy texting that they'll forget about classwork.

reason 3: its a break for students who work hard in class and wont need to hide to send a text to a friend

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I want to tell you that you should allow us to have cell phones at school for three reasons:#1 you wont have so many students up in the office with referrals because they were texting in class to a friend. #2 they will have a break from class work and hard working. they wont be so busy in class texting that they'll forget about class.

You wont be so busy every day with parents coming and try getting their students cell phone and wont have a bunch of kids every twenty minutes. They will have a GOOD

break and text all they want without having to hide their cell phones they will feel good and so will parents! they will have better grades in class and that's what SCHOOL_NAME wants right. there will probably be more and more students every year. this school will probably be popular and students will have found the right school. the one they fit right in. Oh and of course you will have a break from so many referrals that you wont even know what they are.

As you can see everything can work out just fine and every one will be happy!

Well fit right in!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
