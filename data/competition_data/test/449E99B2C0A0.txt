Many kids are home schooled. And there has been a lot of debate to whether or not it is better than public or private school. The debate spans from social skill problems, bullying, and learning opportunity. In my personal opinion home schooling is a more beneficial for students because they have a choice in what they can learn, they can learn more efficiently, and they will have more time for other activities.

First, being able to choose what to learn is very important. Public school has very limited options, especially if they are in AP or IB classes. In IB kids are limited to only three sciences: Biology, Chemistry and Physics. although they are important classes, they are very basic and dont allow for expanded knowledge of other sciences. But in home schooling they are able to pick and choose any science they wish. There are no restrictions as to what you want to learn. A good example is, if a kid wants to be a pilot, he or she would attend classes more geared towards aerodynamics and engineering. These options are not only limited to sciences though, another example is language. In public school there are usually two to three choices to choose from; Spanish, French and American sign language. It is very important to understand another language and having only three choices is extremely limiting. But that is not the case with home schooling. In homeschooling the student is open to every language there is. Having the option to learn every language is an amazing opportunity. Many jobs and careers open up the moment you learn another language. Not only does it open jobs but it also allows the student to have access to other cultures and speak with people from other countries, which further expands their thirst for knowledge.

Being home schooled also is a more efficient way of learning. A day in public school is seven hours long. That leaves about an hour and thirty minutes for every class. Being able to grasp a concept and have a concrete understanding of that concept is very difficult to do in an hour and a half. But with homeschooling the student has as much time they need to fully understand a concept. Not only do they have unlimited time but they also have the internet as an extremely efficient learning source. Additionally, in public school there is a lot of waiting. Whether it's for a teacher to move on or for a fellow classmate to catch up. It is very inefficient way of conducting a lesson. The teacher has to constantly be checking on students to be sure that they understand the subject. Not only that, but a single class can range from fifteen to thirty kids. This causes the learning environment to reach a plateau, where nothing new is being taught because a couple kids dont understand the material. None of that is a problem with homeschooling. The student can finish a lesson at their own pace and move on to learn other things. It's more efficient to be able to learn something in an hour and have a full understanding of it and move on without having to wait for other students. There is no waiting involved and is a constant flow of learning new knowledge.

Finally, being home schooled leaves more time for other activities/extracurriculars. In public school there is very little time after school to be able to have fun or do other activities. Generic_School for example starts at 8:20 AM and ends at 3:00 PM. this leaves students with three to four hours to do the things that they like, excluding homework and studying. When homework and studying are added in it equates out to about an hour or two to be able to do things. The students who get affected by this the most are student athletes. Most teams practice for about two hours, which leaves students to get home around five o'clock. But when the student gets home they have to do homework and study, and by the time they're done its already seven o'clock. None of this is an issue with homeschooling. The moment the student wakes up they can work on school work and get it all done before its even noon. Or they can spread it out evenly throughout the day. This causes the student to have more free time and pursue other things that interest them. For example, a student can wake up and work on school work while eating breakfast. They would work hard until they finished their work, which would take a lot less time than being in public school. When they are done they have the rest of the day to either play a sport, go to museums, or explore the arts. Additionally, having that much free time would encourage students to participate in more volunteer work. Since they wont have to be at a building for seven hours they can go outside whenever and will be more inclined to help the community. This will result in a healthier and more friendly living environment.

In conclusion, there is a lot of debate about whether or not kids should be home schooled or should attend public school. But there are far more benefits of students being home schooled. The benefits range from being able to have a choice in what to learn, being able to learn a subject more efficiently, and having more time to do extracurriculars/other activities.
