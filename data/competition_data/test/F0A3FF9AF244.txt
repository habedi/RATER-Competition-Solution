In The United States of America and throughout the whole world the usage of cars has been in existence for so many years. Humans use this vehicle to get from one place to another in a easier way. Cars have not always been a safe spot to be in. Many human beings have lost their lives because of a car accident. Technology and social media has had a big growth throughout the years and it has played a major part in car accidents. Phones should not be used while driving.

The first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you have a higher chance of getting in a car accident. Getting in a car accident is bad because you are able to lose your life or even worse, killing someone else. If you were to die in a car accident you would definitely leave your family destroyed. Imagine your mother and father having to bury you instead of the opposite way around. It's most likely that you will always live with the fault that you killed someone else. Putting the phone on the side and on do not disturb is something so easy to do than can benefit you in the long run.

The second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you can get yourself a ticket. You might not think that it's a big deal but it really is. A ticket can cost you a lot of money and sometimes trouble. A ticket can cost you more than what you would pay for your phone bill. Having a ticket means having a bad record. For any reason when you want to get a new job, They will be able to tell that you aren't a responsible driver and even worse not a responsible person. It's better to have a good record than to not have one and not be able to get the job you want.

The third reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because phones can be put on do not disturb. When your phone is on do not disturb you are not capable of receiving calls, text messages, and notifications from any of your social media accounts. You have to be able to control your brain and body. Your phone is not a need, It's not something you have to be holding every second/minute. Allowing your phone to be on do not disturb is allowing you to live a longer life and prevent a tragedy like a car accident. It's better to think soon than regretting it later when it's too late.

A phone should not be allowed to be used while driving because you can kill yourself or kill someone else, you can get yourself a ticket, and phones can be put on do not disturb. It's nothing new to watch the news and see that there's another victim of a car accident due to phones. People have to think better and make smart decisions on the road. Once you have your hands on the wheel you shouldn't take your eyes off the road. Accidents due to being on your phone can cause you stress in life and also capable of having bad memories. Prevent is better than to regret and that will be the smartest quote to remember in life. Keep your eyes on the road and don't let a phone distract you.
