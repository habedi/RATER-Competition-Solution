With the rise of the internet, access to information has become easier than ever. people now have access to colledge level information for free and in an intsant. Of course, not all information is reliable, so credible sources and online schools still charge money. one topic for debate is online schooling, and wether or not students would benefit from these programs. Students would benefit from taking online classes because it is self-paced, time efficent, and the experience is one-on-one with the teacher.

A benefit to online classes is the fact that it is self-paced. Often in traditional schooling, subjects are rushed and students are not provided enough time properly learn the material, since they have to meet deadlines or curriculum standards. This leads to grades suffering, and time wasted as the student does not retain the information. With online classes being focused on the individual, it does not depend that all students meet a standard to progress. Students have the oppurtunity to focus on difficult topics and teacher can point out the specific mistakes that student is making. however, not only do online classes benefit students who are behind, but also those who are ahead academically. Self-paced does not just mean the time taken to study, but also the level that is taken and when it id taken. Most highschools in the U.S. have students be in class by around 8:00 a. m. and the students are limited in academics due to their grade level. Potential is wasted since students cannot progress after a certain limit that their grade level has. Being self-paced would not only allow for improved learning, but also higher progressions, which leads to more oppurtunities in life, and improved time management.

Another benefit to online classes is the time-efficiency that it would provide. Due to the fact that the classes take place in the home of the student, it saves time as there is no need for tansportation, time in between classes, or waiting for the class to be present. In Vienna, Virgina, students spend an average of 20 minutes to get from home to school by bus, and 30 minutes walking. Take into consideration that the process repeats twice a day, and students spend 40-60 minutes on transportation. To add on, in schools, to transition from one class to another takes 5 minutes, and there are four classes a day. When everything adds up, the total comes to 60-80 minutes spent on just transitioning from place to place. Not only that but traditional classes take around eight hours a day, five days a week. While online schools are limited and not much data is available to compare schools, online colledges have shown to be completed much quicker, as students earn bachelor's degrees, which would have taken four years, in three years or less, leading to job opputrunities earlier in life. With time cleared up, students have more breathing room as well as time to improve other skills.

Furthermore, online classes provide one-on-one interaction with a teacher rather than a whole classroom of students. The downsides to having only one instructor and twenty to thirty students per class is the lack of personal time between the teachers and the students. In online classes, the class tends to have 1-6 students.

All students are different; they excel and struggle in different areas. There is no teaching method that works for all students. Seeing how the class is more personal, the teaching styles of the instructor would adjust to fit the learning style of the student. While public schools offer IEP's or special classes, it is meant for students who have conditions or learn slowly. However, this does not mean everyone else can be taught with the standard system of teaching. A one-on-one approach would allow students and teachers to engage in a way that would yield the most results.

If online classes were to be implented in the lives of students, many would reap benefits of self-pacing, time efficiency, and personal connection with the teacher. However, one concern is the lack of friendships students have as they have no classmates to interact with. This concern can be dismissed as many kids have taken advantage of social media and online servers to form friendships, so the lack of physial presence would not affect the students' social lives. Not only should students take advantage of the internet for their social lives but also their education. Online schooling has many upsides, and could become the future of education.
