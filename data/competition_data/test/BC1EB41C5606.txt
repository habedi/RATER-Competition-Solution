You may not know, but schools have been requiring students to complete summer projects so they can still continue to learn over summer break. You probably wondering now like, why would they do that, but thats not the question. This individual have to explain should the projects contain the teacher designing them or the students designing them. As one, the projects should contain the students designing them because some students like to use their own creativity, when you come up with your own things,accomplish the and do good on it, that make a person feel good about their self, may want to come up with your own so people can use the material that's already at home. yes, some people may think that the teacher should design and some people may think that student should design them, but as one, this essay will contain it being the students designing their own projects.

Well, here will talk about how people like to use their own creativity. For example, I know a female that like to draw, shes very creative and she always drawing on her spare time. If her teacher does not have as much creativity as she does it would not be no fun for her. If the teacher was to design the projects she would not to get to use her creativity as much as she would like. Do not get me wrong she will use it even if her teacher was to design the projects she will not use as much as she would if she was to sit down and think of a design herself. If she can sit down and think of one herself then she can fully use her creativity and then she will have more fun doing the project because she can come up with her own idea.

This specific paragraph will talk about how when people come up with their own ideas and accomplish them, it make them feel good about themselves and it pushes them to do more. If someone had to write a three page paper and had to turn it in by the end of summer break and they plan on having it done by the end of June and they accomplish that goal, its going to make them proud and make them feel good about their selves. Yea, some people may say otherwise such as they only did it because they had no choice and it was grade, but thats not true because people always have a choice. They did it because they wanted to accomplish their goal that they set and they did that. Im pretty sure no students wants to go on summer break and do a project or work because that suppose to be our time off from school. That's our only long break that we get to have.

Last reason contains wanting to pick your own project so people can just use the materials that they have at home instead of going to the store and having to but some materials. For example, if a person was to have supplies to do the project that they want to do and the teacher say, "i'm going to pick your projects". Then she give someone a project that you do not have none of the material for and the that person have to go out and spend their precious money on a project. Instead, this is y this should contain students designing their own projects and then that person can just pick a project they already got the materials for.

Finally we reach the end of this confident essay. Some people will not agree to what this person said and some people may agree to what this person said. This person is not here to worry about who agree with her or not she just want to leave her opinion and how she feel about the question. With all that being said, these are this ones reasons to why she think that the school summer projects should be student designed and not teacher designed. Hope you enjoyed reading my confident and amazing essay.
