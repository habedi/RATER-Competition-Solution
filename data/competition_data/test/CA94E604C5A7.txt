Policy 2 because, think the kids would use them during class time also when the teacher is not looking. I think they would like the rule because they would use them in lunch and in free time, but they would take advantage of the rule. For example after a test when the teacher gives you time to read or do your homework, I think that's when kids would use them. They would use them when a teacher is not looking, or even when the teacher is teaching. I think most kids would like this rule because they would be aloud to use there phones and not get in trouble. I think if they were aloud they would not under stand what the teacher is telling them to do, maybe the schools average on tests would go down if this happens. That's why I think passing that rule would be bad. Thank you for your time.
