Dear Principal,

I personally think that you should let the students with a c average because a C is still a passing grade on a report card or progress report. Even though some of us students have a better grade then just a C average. If you don't let them play then they won't have a chance to get better at that sport they play or they won't get a chance to tryout a new sport that they really wanted to see. Also the more students you have trying out on a team then you will have a better chance of picking the people who plays really well. Even though it is bad to get a C I still think you should at least let them tryout in sports if you change are school policy to a B to a C then there would be less kids volunteering in sports because most of the students have a C average on there report card.

In addition you should let the students with a c average to participate in this event or should i say a sport. On and on if i were this principal of this school i would not change the school policy for the benefit of our students at this school. Just think of all the opportunity's a students has at this school if they tryout and play for a sport at the school. When you change the school policy think of all the bad things or how you would ruin someone or somebody's life because they had got a C average and can't tryout on a sport that they have been playing for there whole life. If I were in that situation that would ruin my whole life because i play a sport that i have been playing my whole life.

All though it would probably make us a c school it is worth the chance if half of the school has a C average and they all play sports, but you still have to think about the bad and the good possibilities you would have if you don't change the school policy to a B average. Last but not least it would help the kids who would like to play a sport.

P S: I hope that if you change the school policy to a B average that you would not have that many kids who are trying out in a sport at are school.
