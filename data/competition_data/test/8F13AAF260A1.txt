Dear Principal,

I think that we should not change the policy so that you can only play sports if you have a B average. I think that many students and parents will complain about this for similar reasons that I have. I also think that if this policy goes into effect then their will be very few people on the various sports teams and the teams would not be as good.

I have many reasons for why I don't think that this policy should go into effect. My main reason is that a lot of the people who are very athletic and good at almost all sports have trouble concentrating in a classroom because they just want to be out doing something, anything. I think that if you took away the ability for them to play sports with their friends from school, the majority of the kids would start to do even worse in the classroom because they just don't care anymore. Yes, some would work harder to get better grades, but who knows if they even could. They probable have never really tried before, so it would be a great struggle for them.

Another of my big reasons is that as the Principal of our school, you should care about how the different sports teams are doing in their various seasons. If the kids who were better at sports could not play because their grades weren't so hot, then the teams would probably be not very good or their would be no team at all because there were not enough people to play on the team. Then the kids who did want to play would not get the chance to and then them and their parents would be mad at the school and you.

My last reason is, who would coach? All of the good coaches are generally a parent of one of the kids on the team, one of the good kids on the team. So if all the kids who were good at that sport could not play, then their parent would not want to coach if their kid wasn't on the team.

So as you can see it is a very bad idea to change the policy to a B average instead of a C average. There are many rock solid reasons not to change the policy above. I advise you to read over them thoroughly and make your decision. Please make the right choice, and remember if the knew policy does go into effect then it won't just be me that you are hearing from.

Sincerely,

Your anonymous sports fanatic
