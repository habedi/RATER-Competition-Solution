Students-designed projects should always be assigned even during the school year. Students-design are more understandable that teacher-design. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students.

Even though, teacher-design projects will be able to test our knowledge. They are not made for children the way a student- design would be. Student- design projects will relate to students more because it will be base around us. We will have total control, unlike how sum teacher-design projects have rules and guidelines that stop us from being fully open. For, example i had to do a essay about my summer adventures. I chose to write about the time i visited my grandparents in Florida. A few days went by and my teacher wanted to talk to me. She wanted me to rethink my essay because she did not feel any excitement reading it. I didn't agree with her because i always had fun with my grandparents. We would feed the sea turtles, go on night walks at the beach, and go to the board walk's carnival. She still felt as if i wasn't meet the project requirements. This project played a important role in my grade, so i accepted it and rewrote my essay.

In addition student-based projects will show how creative we are. This will give students the opportunity to show off their talent and ideas. Teacher- designed projects do not always allow students to show what they are fully capable of, it only shows what they want to see. Such as, my friend Generic_Name had to do a portrait for her finals in art. She sketched an amazing portrait with a lot of details, so she could show her skills off. This was very risky, to much detail could throw the sketch off. Her adviser thought that she should do something simple to ensure she will get an easy A. Generic_Name wanted more that a easy grade, she wanted her artwork to inspire people and to make a mark, so she went with her idea instead. Now her paint is hanging in the museum of art and is displayed every month downtown.

Next, Student-designed projects will be way more fun and entertaining for students. Every year we receive projects that are boring and does not interest us. Teacher-designed project have no personality and are way to formal. Students-designed projects can be more funny, silly and excited, it can bring happiness back to school projects. For example, two teachers, Generic_Name and Generic_Name assigned the same project. Generic_Name gave her students a teacher-designed project, but Generic_Name didnt. She let her students chose their own project and gave them a rubric of what she would be looking for. Generic_Name class's project still related to science but was personalized. It showed that they really tried and had fun doing this project. She had never seen so many smiles on students faces as they presented their projects. It showed her that she made the right chose.

In conclusion, these are all the reason why we should get student-designed projects. It is showed that student- designed projects can help and motivate students. Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students. In the end this will be the best for students.
