The author presents the idea and supports it very well with all of this information that he has provided and mentioned in this exerpt. Getting samples from Venus could be quite beneficial to us humans in furthing our space exploration and devolping more advanced and harder to breach technology and systems. Scientists predicted that Venus may have once been covered in oceans on the surface and been like earth a very long time ago. In paragraph four the author states that,"If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to it's surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." If we could get artifacts or samples of soil we could be able to discover out of this world (literally) species that could help us further more understand what Venus used to look like and the type of life that could have been on it. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (or NASA) has been working on new types of systems that could be able to withstand the harsh conditions presented on Venus, by using old space type Mechinical computers. If they could use those they would be way more durable and wouldn't require any electricity at all furthermore extending the time we could stay on Venus. You probably ask why don't we just hover above the planet and just take photos. Well here's the problem, the 97% carbon dixoide atmosphere and most forms of light cannot penerate through the thick atmosphere, rending photos and videos virtually impossible. Our curious humans minds bring us closer and closer to exploring the mysterious planet. Only time will tell what we will invent and what we will learn from this beautiful planet. That's if we go back.
