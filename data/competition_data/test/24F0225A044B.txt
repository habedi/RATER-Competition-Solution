It is hard to imagine being a scientist at NASA, But if i was a scientist at NASA discussing the face with someone who thought it was an alien structure, I would use three pieces of evidence to support the claim that its just a natural land form. The first piese of evidence would be Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper then the original photos. The secouned piece of evidence i would use would be Malin's team captured a photo using the camera's maximum resolution. The third piece of evidence i would use would be the picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

The first piece of evidence, On April 5, 1998, The MArs Surveyor flew over the cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper then the original photos. What the photo revealed was a natural land formation not an alien monument.

The secouned piece of evidence, Malins team captured a photo using the cameras maximum resolution. In the Viking photo the pixels were only 43 meters, But every pixel was 1.56 meters in the 2001 photo. That means in a image three times larger than the pixel size you would see objects such as airplans, pyramids or small shacks in the photo.

Finally the third piece of evidence, The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which is a common land formation around the American West.

Thouses are the three pieces of evidence i would use to support my claim and convince someone that the face is just a landformation.

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper then the original photos revealing a natural land formation. Malin's team captured a photo using the camera's maximum resolution that would have shown any ariplans or pyamids. Finnaly is is equivalent to landformations on earth.
