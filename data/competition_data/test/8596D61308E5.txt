When describing the face found on Mars I would first tell about how it was found. The face on Mars was located by accident by a spacecraft circling around the planet Mars taking snapshots of possible landing areas for its sister ship Viking 2, when the spacecraft saw a look-alike of a human face.

I would then start to describe the facts about the face. It was also enormous too,two miles long from end to end. At first scientists believed it was a Martian mesa, which was common around the area the face was located in. Eventually the picture was unveiled for the world to see, for 25 years the image was posted in haunted grocery check out lines or in books and magazines, it even stared in a hollywood film too. Although a few scientists did believe that the face found on mars wasn't in fact an alien artifact.

After i would then finishis by reveileing facts and information to them. The face had been photgraphed to get a clearer picture of what looked like to be the head of and Egyptian. Although Cydonia, the place where the face was located, is not easily found the photagraphers, on April 5, 1998, were able to find it and took more pictures to get good looks at it. What they found in the image's were actually showing a butte or mesa, commonly known as ladforms, they are also common around the west of America. The most likely scenerio for the face to of been built was by natural lanforms and erosion. Even some scientists believed that the face was just a landformation and not an alien artifact.
