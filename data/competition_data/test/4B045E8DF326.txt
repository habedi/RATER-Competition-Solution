Imagine you are a student, There is only two days until summer break and you cant wait to finally be free of all the boring school work. Then your teacher imforms you that you'll be having a summer project. Do you really want more work that will take up your free time? What if there was another way. Summer is the time for students to relax, unwind, and have a break from school. They should be able to design their own summer projects to make their time more enjoyable.

First, Summer is the students break time from everything school related. They finally have the chance to relax their bodies and brain from all the cludder from school. Students will more likely remember to do the project if they create them. Students would much rather spend their free time doing things they enjoy or want to do. because of all the fun they did during break and will be more happier and egur to tell someone or just want to share their summer experience.

Second, Teachers can't assign projects that each student would like. Everyone has their own way of things, some people dont like this or cant relate to some things people write or presented. If students don't like the project the teacher assigned they'll most like forget about it and wont finish it, meaning zero in the grade book. Teachers assign one project about a certain thing so it wont be that much work but at the same time a lot because of the many students.

Finally, students can get benefits from designing their own project. it teaches them differant skills like independents, responabiltlies, and self awarness. Provide insight of what the teachers be like and what they be having to do durning the weekends and breaks. Students will get to learn how the real world is and that you can't go out every single weekend cause you will work or other things important to care of before getting into the fun things.

Altogether, students designing their own projects can be very beneficial, and transform the student way of thinking about their work.
