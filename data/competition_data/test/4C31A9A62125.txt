Have you ever looked in a telescope and seen the Face on Mars? Many people believe the The Face on Mars was created by aliens, but it is a natural landform. The Face on Mars is a natural landform because images from a JPL website showed the Face was a natural landform, the Face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, and if there was an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would benefit from it.

First, on April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Face for the first time. "Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." (7) When a JPL website revealed the photo many anxious waiters were astounished that the Cydonia was a natural landform.

Secondly,

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program, confirmed the Face was a of a butte or mesa. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, (12) Mr. Garvin also claimed Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. (12) Which means that the Face on Mars is very similar to a lave dome, butte, or mesa.

Next, if there was an ancient civilization on Mars and they made the Face then NASA would benefit from it. "Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." (5) This quote is explaining that if NASA knew there was an ancient civilization on Mars then they would benefit from the civilization. Why would NASA keep an ancient civilization on Mars a secret if they could benefit from the situation?

Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because images from a JPL web site showed the Face was a natural landform, the Face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, and if there was an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would benefit from it. Now do you believe the Face on Mars was created by aliens?
