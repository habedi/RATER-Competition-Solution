Dear Principal,

I just read the two possible cell phone policies. I think that the school should use the first policy, that said you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I agree with this policy because I think if the students are using their cell phones in the hallway, it is not interrupting or distracting to classes. Another reason I think the first policy is better is that if the students need something, like a ride home from school, they can call there parents during passing periods to tell them that they will be staying after school later and what time to pick them up. That way they will not have to go to the office to call during class. Doing this, they will not have to miss anything in class.

Students should be able to use cell phones at lunch because it is not even a class. They should be able to text or call people during that time. The teachers should allow students to use their cell phones because there is no reason they shouldn't be able to use them at lunch. Lunch and passing periods are supposed to be breaks, so that the students don't have to be working the whole time they are at school. If the students choose to use this time texting or calling people, that should be their own choice.

These are some of the reasons why I think cell phones should be allowed to be used by students during lunch and other free times. I think the teachers should be less strict about using cell phones at these time. Thank you for reading my letter and considering this ideas.

Sincerely,
