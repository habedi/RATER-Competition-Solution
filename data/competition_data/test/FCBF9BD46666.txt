Dear Principal,

I think that you should not make community service a requirement but you should make a program available to students who would like to do community service in there spare time or even during there elective time. As you know colleges look for community service hours and many good high schools look for community service time. There should be a elective given as a chose to students, so that they can get community service hours.

For many students community service is a punishment, they think they should only have to do it if they get in trouble. So why make the students who don't care for community service do it? If we force them they will just do a mediocre job. For the students who do want to do community service, you should let them know that they will be given high school hours or even college hours depending on there age and grade there in. I know because the high school I would like to go to SCHOOL_NAME requires me to have community service to graduate or move on to the next grade. If a student is though caught doing something wrong you should have him/her do community service for there punishment, but make sure it is clear to them that they do no get high school or college community service hours. Please write back if you think my ideas are for the school, I will be very happy to hear from you and to here you criticism about my ideas. God bless.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
