Students come to school to socialize and expand their knowledge in a classroom setting. Removing this idea of a classroom setting will have detrimental impact on students as it is a new idea they have not previously been exposed to and will result in a lack of students control. Distance learning is not beneficial to students as it keeps them from truly interacting with content and lacks the personal association with others, but can be beneficial when students are unable to attend school due to various reasons.

Technology is seen as a benefit in many ways and distance learning is a direct outcome of this, but can be detrimental on students comprehension. Students are increasingly getting addicted to technology and numerous devices they may use in every life. With all assignments and exams put online students lose the tangible aspect of learning. They lose the opportunity to interact with materials in a science lab, writing on paper during tests, and forgetting basic supplies. Moving to fully virtual classrooms would lose this aspect as a whole. Students would no longer have the ability to interact with their material in person and as a result of the digitized classroom would be able to do all school related assignments with just a technological device. Students are unable to build proper emotional relationships with others due to the physical barrier. The sense of control present in a classroom will be lacking if everything school related becomes virtual. The facilitation of control would be lost without a teacher in front of a student to monitor them.

Students are involved in numerous school related activities that would not be possible with distance learning. These activities consist of sports and clubs that are able to further the communication and collaboration between students. Students are able to become role models by taking leadership opportunities in these extracurricular activities. Once students are moving to college or to pursue careers the chances of being in a distanced virtual career setting is very low. The lack of proper communication skills as a result of these students not attending an institution in person would hurt these students in the long run. Certain assignments and public speaking are aspects of schooling that cannot be properly recreated on a virtual platform. Specifically science classes with labs that require interaction with materials are difficult to be recreated or comprehended by students when completed virtually. Studies show that students are more able to retain information when they have physically interacted with it. Students also have different modes of learning that are beneficial to them with them being auditory, visual, and tactile learners. The tactile learners will be hurt the most by this type of system and provides an increasingly unfair advantage to the auditory and visual learners. Without a place to go for school there is no guarantee a student will socialize with others outside of where they live and attend school virtually from. They will lose the fundamental principles of proper communication with others whether it may be casual or formal. They are met with restraint from immersing themselves in different lifestyles and being exposed to culturally diverse people who can teach them much more than simply taught in classrooms. Overall, students would be met with advancements in their character and personality while also being educated as opposed to virtual learning which would only focus on the educational aspect of schooling.

Distance learning has the potential to be beneficial for students who are unable to attend a physical school as a result of personal reasons. Students with medical conditions that keep them from being able to come to school would be able to attend school in a fair way. This is because every student is being educated in the same way and has no advantage over the other as they are all interacting with each other and the material in the same virtual sense. While this may be a beneficial short term solution to these students suffering medical conditions, after the issue is resolved it is better to integrate them back into the physical schooling system to avoid the feeling of isolation they would receive from remaining at home. Students who feel uncomfortable in the presence of others due to previous trauma or bullying in schools are able to attend school from the comfort of their homes. This gives students the ability to be physically and emotionally safe from any harm social construct might have given them at school. Studies show the detrimental impact bullying can have on an individual and how it is able to lead to psychological disorders such as depression as students may plunge into a constant state of feeling worthless. Even as bullying may be an issue, cyberbullying also exists online so confining students to their homes to avoid emotional impacts of harassment such as bullying would not be the proper solution to the issue. There is no guarantee that keeping these students at home will avoid the impact that cyberbullying may have on them, which would have the same or worse impact on an individual as bullying in person. With online teaching through virtual classrooms and courses the disadvantages outweigh the benefits and until specific issues are solved, such as bullying and effectiveness of online teaching, it will not be a proper system to implement in society.

Virtual distance learning is detrimental through the lack of physical interaction, emotional connection, yet is able to occasionally benefit students with specific reasons of being unable to attend school. Schooling has taken place in person and in schools for all these years for a reason and changing this now would have damaging impact on students and teachers. Whether it may be a student taking a test or a teacher in a meeting, virtual distance learning would create a lack of personal interaction between individuals and create a distance between all.
