In my option I very much disagree all student must attend classes in my case , staying home by the way using the internet, online or video conferencing wouldnt be benefit for any of those students so, therefore staying home classes is not good in anybody intense, staying home classes can be the most distancing learning when you are suppose to be online doing your work you be watching television so classes home is unaccepted.

The main reason why i think its unaccepted because most of the stuff you learning in class you never be hearing about them online the most smart way is the sit in class and pay attention i just feel like staying home classes is just a not safe for examples, ''Generic_Name and Generic_Name" ,was in a group in classes to present about cell membrane in Bio the presentation was mainly about how is cell membrane found , what is the produce of cell membrane, is there DNA or RNA is cell membrane, so on the online class wouldnt been so active in the class.

In my case all student who do the distance learning classes dont do most of there work because they dont get it check like how a real teacher would have check they word. All student must be in there classes staying home classes really dont help them to there ability my reason why i dont like staying home classes like you probably be on videos conferencing while you baby sitting your little sister so there be a lot of distance in the household while you trying to learn so no i dont agree with kid staying home.

So therefore the school should have a distance learning program inside the school for all student that dont want to be in classes with other student should be by there self in my way i feel like that would be the best way to resolve this issues it will help other student to come to there ability in everyway just with a teacher in the room to help them in my case distance learning can be fun in the right way .
