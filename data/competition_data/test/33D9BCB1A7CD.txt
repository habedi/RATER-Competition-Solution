To the Editor:

Yes I do believe that students and myself should have a B average.

We also do need to try harder for ourselves because of the real world that's ahead of us.

I would love to have an A average but to be honest I'm not actually trying hard enough.

But I have to make up my mind that i can do it without having doubt in myself.

That's mostly why students sometimes fail or get held back because they think they can't do it.

I would also love having good enough grades to go to a good college and make a good life for what's ahead for me and my career. I want to have fun with my career and love doing it without having to go back to school because that would waste time for me and it could hurt my time for my job. I want to be a Pharmacist or a R.N. My dream career is to be an engineer on planes. I think I'm not smart enough so I don't believe in myself. Anyway back to the policy yes i do go with the principal on this on because he is right and he's doing it to help us out.

Mostly all my C average grades have come from my reading. I don't like reading at all because i find no fun to it. But I got to deal with it because it could hurt my life later on. I know there is lots of paperwork to be done and read. Reading is probably my most disliked subject and right now Social Studies is my favorite because its not a lot of homework and its actually easy this year but life isn't just handed to me. I'm finally starting to like science again because its interesting also. But for some reason I don't like reading. My dad loves reading, but my mom hates it. I guess I am like my mom. She doesn't like reading but she could solve any algebra problem you give her. My mom is real smart but I'm not. How do I know. because she didn't have her first C until her junior year. Can't no one tell me that my mom isn't smart. I've made so many C'S and B'S I couldn't believe it when I realized I had my first A in one class. But in grade average I'm like my dad. I wish school wasn't so hard a bunch of the time. A lot of the times i hardly ever get what the teachers teach me. No Offense but a lot of times that happens. I am a person that you can't teach unless there's excitement going on in it.
