I think the summer projects should be student-designed, why ? during the summer students would not like to think about any school work. It's good to go over and have work from school during your break so when you come back you can earn new material without forgetting. However a teacher-designed could work also, students don't want to feel like we're still in school during our whole break. Our break is to have fun and go out and enjoy the weather and ourselves. Now we are going to go in detail and talk about both opinions of the argument.

For the teacher-designed many students will agree to that. Teachers will have to come back the last month to get their classroom situated, and they plan throughout the summer and go to training. Some teachers might be changed to a different subject to teach. Instead of giving work packets, teachers can email work to do online and the students might do it. And some teachers will be seeing students during break because of summer school, for the teachers whose teaching there they can ask for their work while sitting with them.

The student-designed, some might agree and disagree. Some students feel as if their summer break purpose is to take a break from school work. Some kids don't have a problem with remembering what they learned the last school year. Others naturally study and go over anything they struggled with. And the students who don't mind won't have a problem with doing projects over their break.

The disagreeing part, many students feel as if they worked hard and deserve a break. Some students be busy while out of school, some work and attend camps. For ones who do other stuff might not have enough time to get the projects done on time. Many just not do it because there is no school. Being that it's not no school they might think it's not counted against them.

My opinion on it, is that I think that the summer projects should be teacher-designed, it'll loosen a lot of other things that needs to be done in the summer time during break.
