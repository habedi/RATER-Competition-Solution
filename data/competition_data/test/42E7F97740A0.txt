Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Please reconsider your judgements. In my opinion I think that your decision to raise the average from a B to a C is very unjust and bias. It is unjust because sports consume a lot of time in our daily lives. in my opinion it is bias because you are pressuring us students to do better by raising the standards.

Not all students are intellectual and sporty. Most of our sports consume a portion of our days. it wouldn't be unfair to raise the average because most of simply may not have time to do our homework, or get A' s on all of our tests.

Also, with the pressures of our extra-curricular activities, such as student council and yearbook, we may not get all A' s and B' s in all of our classes. All of us have responsibilities but your rule will make us reconsider them. Many kids in this school have a C average so, the outcome of this decision may involve many kids dropping out of teams and activities outside of school.

Though, I understand why you're doing this. your trying to make us realize how school is also important and how athletics are not everything. But, this decision is very drastic and you are asking to much of us. Not all of us can balance school and athletics on a daily basis.

So, please reconsider your decision. Though it is a good concept, the outcome may not be the outcome you may have expected. Even though this letter may not reconsider your decision, just think about what is best for us kids.

On behalf of the student body,

STUDENT_NAME
