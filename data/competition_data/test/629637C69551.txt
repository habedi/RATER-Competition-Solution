In this story we are trying to see if the technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

I think that the computer is going to work for that, is not going to be the same but is going to work. The monalisa is something that people believe in but if a new computer software came out with 3-D and 44 major muscles must move like human muscles. I think that computers can read peoples emotions with just a video imagery. In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang said that " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored".

In this case i think that the computers are the prefect thing to work with because the technology is growing really fast. I think that computers should identify if a student is confused or bored. The same technology can make animated faces more expressive. For video games Dr. Huang said that "Most human communication is non-verbal, including emotional communication","computers have to understand that too".

I learned that computers can make a huge different in our life, and it can help us know how we're feeling at the moment. I think that's a really good thing for a future that is coming.
