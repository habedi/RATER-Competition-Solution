I think we should be able to bring our phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as its turned off during class. I think so because if we could use them at lunch and free time we wouldn't have to use it in class and we would be paying attention instead of texting in class. The reason i choose policy 1 is when we have free time in between classes we could use our phones instead of having to hide them and not pay any attention in class, when we could use them and then be able to pay attention in class and have better grades. If we were able to use our phones in school when we were at lunch or had free time we would have better grades because we're paying more attention in class instead of trying to hide our phones under the desk and not paying any attention at all, because we're hiding them.

If there was an emergency and we were at lunch and we couldn't have our phones we wouldn't know what to do because we would get in trouble for having it out, and if we could have it with us at lunch we would be able to know what's going on. When we aren't able to have our phones on us and we do and it goes off it disrupts the class and we don't learn as much as were suppose too. Then if we have policy 1 you wouldn't have to worry about any phones going off or being token up because we would have done everything we had too at lunch or our free time. Sometimes students need a break from the learning and just need to use their phones to get their minds off things. Sometimes students with a phone can only use it when their in school because something's happening at home and they can only talk to the person at school. But again students would be better if we were able to use our phones at lunch or free time.

When teacher's sees students cell phones they take it up and they won't ask "oh why do you have your phone?" no they just take it up and if it was an emergency they wouldn't know because they didn't ask. Sometimes most students use their phones in school because either something happened to their family members' or their parents have to talk to them about something that they forgot when the saw them in the morning. Most students are talking to their parents when the get caught in class. When students use their phones in class its sometimes really important and they get their phones token up because the teacher saw it and they were lecturing in class.
