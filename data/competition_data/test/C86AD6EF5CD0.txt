The Electoral College is not a very sufficient way of electing a president in democracy. The way it is run is faulty. If someone gets one more vote than there apponet they get all of the votes from that state? now what kind of sense does that make? doesnt make very much sense to me Mr. Senator.

In a democracy the people should get to elecct their leader. I know that the Electoral College is usually gives the same results as the popular vote but its not always 100% accurate. There is honestly no reason to have the Electoral College. The founding fathers put it in place but that was 200 years ago and I have no idea what they were thinking.

In my state, Florida in 2012 there was a very close election but Obama won by a very small margin and recieved all 29 votes from our state. That is some major bologna Mr. Senator. This is the United States of America and the canidate should recieve every vote he gets. The same thing happened in the 2000 election as well. it's not a reasonable sytem Mr. Senator.

The Electoral College has got to go. It is a faulty and injust way of electing a president here in the U.S.A. I love this country more than your average guy, it's the greatest place on Earth and i truly believe that. I also believe that we need to get rid of the Electoral College because it is absolute trash.
