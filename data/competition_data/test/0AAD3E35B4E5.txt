TEACHER_NAME,

Please consider not making community service mandatory;

reasons supported by this essay:

"Agenda comment!" OTHER_NAME teacher screeches when OTHER_NAME tells her that she does not have her homework due to the fact that her community service took so long. I do not think that community service should be mandatory due to the fact that it would take away from time that could be spent doing homework, or studying for tests. Also, it would take a lot of time away from sports.

To begin, community service takes too much time away form homework, which is what students should be doing. Studies show that community service is extremely time consuming. Homework is important, because it tests whether or not a student understands the subject that the teacher is going over. For example, i know that my seventh grade year was so packed with homework, that i barely had time to do anything other than work on homework. So, please, don't require community service.

Furthermore, students not only need time to do homework, but they also need time to study for upcoming tests and quizzes. Recent studies show that 80% of students study every night, for about 30 minutes. These 30 minutes added to the hour or hour and a half of homework the students get would be too difficult to try and add community service time. Once, my teacher wanted all of us to complete community service, but half of the class was unable to do this, because their parents worked late and so they didn't have a ride to pick them up from wherever they were serving the community.

To continue, it has been proven that at least 70%

of students play sports after school, meaning that with all the homework and studying going on, they definitely won't have any time for community service. A few of my friends play lacrosse, and they really enjoy it. But, they leave their house almost immediately after they get home from school and get home around 8:00 P.M. which is pretty late, especially if they still have an hour left of homework. Sports are just as important as schoolwork, because in order to stay healthy, students have to stay active.

In retrospect, community service is not as necessary because of the amount of time students spend doing schoolwork as well as playing sports. Also, not all students can get a ride to and from wherever they would volunteer at. Please consider my reasoning.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
