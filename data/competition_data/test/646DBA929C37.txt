Summer projects are a way for students to continue their acedemic carrer over the summer. Some believe that these projects should be desinged by students to offer freedom exploration, but teacher desinged projects give structure, regulatoin ,and garuntee if students are learning.

One of the best things a teacher desinged project brings is structure. A study from The Universty of South Virgina states that students are three times as likly to do work if its in a structured enviorment. Because students are not in school they lack structure to motivate them to do work, but if there project has a set of guide lines to follow it would make students more likely to do the assingend work.

The teacher designed project would offer a rubric for students to follow. Research from The Old Zealand Education Department found that rubrics give students guidance for learning the matireal they are required to learn. With a rubric to follow there would be a way to regulate stundents to make sure they are learning what they need. Allowing the teacher to determine the progress of each student.

Even with this evidence some believe that having student designed projects are the better choice, because it gives feedom for students to explore interests. But teacher designed projects would still offer freedom to explore interests. With a teacher disigned project a teacher can set standards for what skills students need to learn from the project, but students would still have the freedom to chose what topic they would study. Giving students the fredom to explore interests but still learn the skills they need.

With the evidnece provided it is clear that teacher disgned projects are the best way for students to continue their learning over the summer. Giving them an advantage for the next school year to be at their best.Â
