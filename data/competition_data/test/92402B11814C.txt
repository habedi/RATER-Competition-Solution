I agree with the principal that students should engage in some type of activity outside of school and their current form of education. If students were to do so, then they could meet others who share the same interests, which would benefit all students because they are doing things that they like to do, and at the same time, they are sharing the experience with others who enjoy doing the same activity. Extracurricular activities can help students to find and learn about a skill, whether it's one they've never tried before or one they havent had time to look into yet. In addition, extracurricular activities can help students later on in life when they are in college, applying for a job, or any point in their lives beyond that. The principal has chosen to require students to attend an extracurricular activity, which is not only beneficial to them in many ways, but also to everyone else when the students go out into the world and spread their gifts and talents.

One way that students could be helped by learning an extracurricular activity is that they can meet some new people that they might not have ever met before. Students can become friends with them since they have a bond over the activity that they are both interested in. However, some students are shy and/or have fears of social interactions, which can cause them to avoid these activities, but extracurricular activities can actually help get those timid and quiet students to express themselves through the activity. Sometimes, these students are alone and have no friends, which can lead to them feeling down, as well as anxious; extracurricular activities can help prevent these students from being isolated, and can also help them to relax by eleviating the anxiety that they might feel when they are alone. If students become more extroverted in this manner, then they will feel good about doing an activity that they want to do, which can possibly make them feel better so they are happier and less pessimistic.

The additional requirement of an extracurricular activity is opposed by some students who say that it wastes their time and interferes with their schedule that is always packed. Having a packed schedule is not always a good idea because it could physically and mentally stress the human body; a way to vent this stress is through an extracurricular activity where students can focus on what they're passionate about instead of what stresses them. Other students who disagree say that they don't know what type of activity they want to participate in; thanks to the wide variety of choices available, they will most likely find either an activity that matches their interests or one that helps them to learn something new. Another pro is that they can choose an activity such as Homework Club that assists them in getting their work done so they don't have as much to do. If students really enjoy an activity, they may choose to major in that activity in college, consider it as a job, or at least find it useful sometime later in life, which disproves the argument that extracurricular activities won't ever help anyone.

Some students don't have access to certain materials and items at home and are barely getting by because minorities often get less money than the majority does, which can unfairly deny them the chance to do the activities that they like doing; extracurricular activities are usually held at and/or sponsored by schools that receive enough money, which gives these underprivileged students a chance to finally participate in extracurricular activities. These minorities are often lonely and neglected, so a mandatory extracurricular activity will help them to feel included in a larger group.

In conclusion, I truly believe that it is necessary to add an extracurricular activity to the school curriculum because it can lead to so many good results. Requiring them will lead to students feeling less alone and stressed, as well as finding ways to help reduce that stress and include all students. It will help minority groups to be able to engage in activities that they have previously been unjustly impeded from doing. It will also allow students to find others who are passionate about similar things, which might lead to them becoming friends. Lastly, it will help to prepare students for their future, even if the activity they like to do doesn't seem that useful. For these reasons, I agree with the principal's decision to make an extracurricular activity mandatory.
