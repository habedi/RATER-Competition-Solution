Dear principal,

I heard of that you were thinking about revising the policy of cell phones. I would like you to think of a few things while making your decision. Having a cell phone shouldn't be a problem, as long as it is not out during class. Letting a child have a cell phone in many ways is a good idea.

Say If there is an emergency and a child is unable or too embarrassed to use the Office phone? Whatever the problem is, it could be simply handled by the student excusing him/herself for a phone call. Simple problems like these can be handled in an instant;

if a child has access to his/her cell phone. I know what you are thinking though, "We offer public phones for students to use ; and embarrassment shouldn't be an issue, especially if its a emergency ."

If you show a child that you respect and trust them, they will automatically show you the same. Meaning, a little privacy (but not too much) can go a long way. Also, even though the school provides public phones, if a child decides to use there phone, isn't that less of a phone bill for the school? This way, we are saving more money that could be used for other important services.

Behavior can also be a problem too if a cell phone is used during class. To make sure that this doesn't happen, stricter rules could be mentioned in the policy. Meaning, that If a phone is used during class( not accidentally ringing, more of texting or playing), then the phone should be confiscated for the rest of the semester, or maybe a higher amount should be asked for pick-up.

I hope you take my opinion as kind of like,

"food for thought".

Whichever policy you choose, I know it was chosen for the best. Thank you for taking your time to listen.

From a sincere student ,
