The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If you think that the face is an evidence that theres life on Mars, then think about how they got there and how advance their technology would have to be. The face is just a natural landform because on paragraph 12 it says, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West"(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,12).

You may think that it is evidence that life exist on Mars. I respect that. You got some good evidence, some scienctists even believe that too. That the face is an alien artifact. "Althought few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact"(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,6). I'm not gonna lie, it does look like a face to me too.

Althought it may look like a face, alien artifact , or the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. You still have to get cold hard facts. Some facts like, "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,2).It was even unveiled as " Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose , and mouth"(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,3). With all these facts I say that the Face is just a natural landform.
