Imagine having to stay after school for an activity you don't enjoy. Students spend seven long hours learning each day and the last thing they want to do is stay at school longer. Most students want to relax after a tiring day of learning. I don't think students should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Staying after school for a sport, club, or even student council will take away time with family, make expenses to maintain the school after hours rise, and give students less time to complete homework or attend other commitments.

Spending time with family is important and much needed. If students are forced to stay after school then they're taking away valuable time to be with family. When students are done learning everyone should be able to go home to see their family. A lot of people like to eat dinner together and it would be hard if your kid is having to stay after school for an activity. Adding extra time spent after school can mess up a families plans for the night which isn't fair.

Maintaining the school for seven hours a day is hard enough. Adding at least an hour of the school operating each day increases the money spent on heat, air conditioning, and electricity. Each day one hundred dollars is spent on just electricity for the building. Adding fifteen dollars to each day for electricity will add up. Heat and air conditioning is way more expensive than you think. The school spends around five hundred dollars each week towards keeping the school comfortable. Having extracurricular activities will require that amount to rise.

Majority of students have something to do after school whether it's homework or other commitments. Teachers normally require homework to practice the skills students learn in class. If after school activities are required then homework will have less time to be completed. When there is a small time frame for assignments, students will get stressed and not do their best work. Most kids have a sport or music lesson they attend after school although, the after school activity may get in the way by making the kid late or tired.

Although extracurricular activities may help students get involved with the school, there are many reasons why this is not a good idea. I think the principal should not follow through with this proposal because there could be a lot of negative effects. Taking away time to be with family, more expenses for maintaining the school, and giving less time for homework and other commitments are just three of the many negatives. Forcing students to do something they don't want to after learning hours is not fair. Students and teachers need to spend the afternoon hours at home relaxing not at school.
