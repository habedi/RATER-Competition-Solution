Dear Principal,

I am aware you are considering on changing the schools policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average?

Please don't do that because some people are not as smart as others and I know we have the ability to be very smart but some people don't know how to use they're knowledge.

I understand that School comes before sports and that we are suppose to have a high average if we are wanting to still play but some people may not know how to do a subject or something. Are you still going to not let them play? What if they are really good at sports and they can't happen to get their grade up? Are you still going to make them suffer? Well they are suffering enough because they can't seem to get they're grades up?

Sports are supposed to be about fun and learning. Please don't change our policy to that because some people are trying all they can to get they're C average so they can play. Just give them some slack. That is why i think you Should Not change our school policy.

Thank you,
