The driver's main emphasis is not on the road or traffic, and even at one time trying to handle the phone and vehicle becomes difficult.

Drivers that use cell phones respond slowly and very often make wrong decisions that can trigger fatal accidents affecting other passenger cars. Driving decision making is a vital factor in giving drivers a split second to make a fast decision.
