Everyone can agree that students have to learn someway or another; it's very essential in preparing for life after school and as an adult. It's also safe to say that one person may learn best one way, while another person may learn better in a different manner. That can bring up the argument of: which is better: online classes at home, or being in a physical classroom? While there may be benefits to learning through online classes, it's a lot more beneficial to take classes at an actual school. Students wouldn't benefit from being able to take classes from home because being inside a classroom environment is helpful, there aren't as many hands on activities for students that take online classes, and there isn't very much socializing that takes place.

To begin with, learning inside of an actual classroom environment is extremely helpful to the students. For one, teachers are willing to stay after school to assist or tutor any students that may be struggling in class. Whenever a teacher takes the time to do something like this for a student, it really helps the student in future assignments, and it helps them to grasp the subject area better than before. However, if these students that needed assistance were taking online classes, there wouldn't be much that they could do because they wouldn't have the opportunity of having a teacher stay after school to help them. To further expand on this idea, it's also very helpful to students whenever they can actually see the work that is being done and to hear it being explained by their teacher. If these students were taking at home classes, the only explanations that would be getting are the words that are on their screens whenever they begin a new assignment. Being able to actually hear someone explain and show the physical process of something being done makes a very influential difference in a students learning.

Furthermore, there aren't very many opportunities to do hands on activities for students that take online classes. Considering the fact that everything the student does would be online, the only "hands on" activities that they can do are virtual. While this may not be that big of a problem, it's still very important in some classes to have hands on activities, such as chemistry. With chemistry, there are a lot of labs that the students do that help them to further understand and analyze the information that they're learning, but if the student is taking an online chemistry class, they wouldn't get the chance to do these labs. Additionally, if students don't get the chance to move around and do hands on activities, it can end up demotivating them and cause them to lose interest in the material. The best solution for this is to have them inside of an actual classroom environment to which they can actually learn and stay interested in the subject.

Lastly, students that take at home classes will quickly recognize that there isn't much socializing to do. Since everything that these students do is online, the only socializing that they get to do is with their teacher, which is likely through email. While this lack of communication may not seem that big of a deal, it's extremely important to socialize, especially at younger ages, as it helps students with development. If students are only exposed to a computer screen for their younger years in life, then they will likely have difficulties in being social with others later on into adulthood. Additionally, these students may begin to feel isolated from other students their age due to not being able to socialize very much. Because of something like this, it greatly impacts one's mental health, and the best way to fix this kind of situation is to have the students learn at an actual school. By doing so, it allows them to learn better, and it allows them to socialize with other students their age, and not just their online teacher.

To finalize, it's evident that allowing students to take classes at home isn't very beneficial to them. While being able to take online classes may allow them to work at their own pace to ensure they get good grades, it's ultimately better for students to learn in a more social environment that allows them to participate in activities that help to further their understanding of a subject. Also, by allowing students to learn in an actual classroom setting, it sets them up for adulthood by utilizing much more than online classes do. Essentially, at home classes really end up just harming a students future as it takes a lot away from a student. With that being said, it's a lot better to have students attend classes at school, and not at home.
