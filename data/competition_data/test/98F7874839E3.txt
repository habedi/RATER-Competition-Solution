Dear Principal,

I believe that you should definitely let us use our phones during lunch periods and free time because there's no harm in it really.

Cell phones have become an everyday thing that almost everyone has and uses. You could even go as far to say that they are a mandatory thing to have. In this day and age that's kind of what it seems like.

Kids are getting in trouble all school year for taking their phones out and using them during class, lunch, recess, ect. It's really ridiculous, so if we were able to use our phones during our free time, we probably would give a little and respect that you don't want us to use them during class. Plus having the, "no cell phone policy" isn't really working. Kids use them anyway, and then they get in trouble for it.

But that hasn't stopped them yet, has it?

The only downside to this idea would probably be the fact that some kids might abuse this privilege and use their phone all day at school just because they think they won't get yelled at or in as much trouble anymore. You'd probably end up hearing a lot of, "But you said we could use them!" But it's not fair to the students who wouldn't do that and who would actually be thankful for you letting us use our phones AT ALL during the school day and respect the fact that you said we can't use them in class.

Just something to think about...

Sincerely,
