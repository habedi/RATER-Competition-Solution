Home is where the heart is. Almost everyone is comfortable at their own house, especially if they're still growing up in it. When you are at the place you live you can be yourself, with limited outside noise. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be less distractions and more independence.

A lot of people enjoy working alone and believe they get more work done when they are alone. My first reason for why students would benefit from taking classes at home is that there would be less distractions. At my school there are almost two thousand people, which can be overwhelming sometimes. Being able to take classes at your house would allow students to focus on themselves and their work only, increasing how much work they get done and even how efficient the work is. For example, my mom works from home three to four times and she is always saying how nice it is. She enjoys being on her time schedule and believes she actually gets more work done when she is not in the office.

Another reason students could benefit from taking classes at home is that it allows more independence. Most people would rather work by themselves than in a group. At school sometimes you are forced to work with other people which can make students uncomfortable, and less productive. So having the opportunity to work alone, in your own house would surely be beneficial to many. An example can be myself, I am more comfortable working by myself than in a group. When in a group you have to rely on other people, by yourself its all on you to complete what is necessary and I enjoy having that independence.

Some may say that if this were to happen, students would not get any work done at home. That they would distract themselves with either their phone, the television, or even video games. I can see where they are coming from, but ultimately it is up to the student to do whatever they have to, its their grade and their future. I believe given this opportunity, more than 90% of students would take advantage of it and not allow themselves to get more distracted at home, than at school.

In conclusion, I am confident students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, as there would be less distractions and more independence. Distance learning should be an option at many, if not all school districts.Â
