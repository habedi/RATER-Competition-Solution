If a student has a C average then they should be able to play sports. Having a C average grade isn't bad because they are still passing, they just aren't passing with honor roll. You shouldn't punish kids by not letting them play sports if that's what they love. If they are getting a C, and there teacher says they turn in all there work then they must be trying there hardest, they just might not understand the subject. If they are getting a C

but there teacher says they aren't turning in there work then that's when they shouldn't be able to play sports. But if they like playing sports then they will want to get the best grades they can get, so they don't get kicked off the team. They should be able to play if they have a C but if they have any missing assignments then they should sit out of the game as a lesson, to teach them they need to do all of there work. If they are disrespectful and a distraction in class then they shouldn't be able to play because in order to play on a team you have to respect your teammates and pay attention to your coach so you understand what they are doing. Some students turn in all there work and do good in school they just might not understand a subject such as math. People have there weaknesses and strengths but they might have a D in that class because they might not of understood the questions on the test. There should be a tutoring class for people that play sports but need help with schoolwork. If a student that plays a sport needs help with his or her work they should take the time before school, after school, or during lunch to ask there teacher for help if they didn't understand something. Or they can go on websites that will help them with homework if they need it. If you know that you will forget about an assignment that you have to do you should write it down somewhere you look everyday, or you can ask a friend for there number so you can call them and ask them what the homework was for that day.
