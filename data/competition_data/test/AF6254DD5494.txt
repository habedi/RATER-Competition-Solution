Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As you may know, many elementary schools have begun to include student community service in their required curricular.

In my opinion, our school should have community service available, but not a requirement.

There are many pros and cons of this idea, but I sincerely believe this is something you should think about.

Nowadays, schools have a very wide variety of different extra curricular activities available for students to part take in.

Students have become very occupied and busy because of them, but they are excellent in enriching students' minds academically and physically.

I believe that our school should add to our wonderful list of extra curricular activities, and have community service as an option for students.

Having community service would not only help others, but the students would have a chance to see how helping others and the community can be satisfactory and fun.

Instead of just being taught about going out in the world and making a difference, we can actually live out what we are taught.

Physically performing what we have learned is taking school to the next level.

Students would be obtaining knowledge on discovering ways in which performing a task meant to assist others can be enjoyable.

Some students or faculty will indefinitely be opposed to this suggestion.

They may feel that adding community service to our curricular would be taking away from other clubs and/or teams the school has been supporting for years.

What they do not understand, is that nothing would be taken away.

Community service is something that everyone should be taking part in, not just when our parents force us to or taking a once-a-year field trip to the park to pick up litter.

It should be part of our lives in general.

Like I said before, this would, in no way, shape, or form be forced upon the students to do.

It is merely an excellent chance to provide students with an experience that could possibly change their lives for the good.

My opinion on community service may not and will not agree with everyone.

Not every idea does.

In fact, most of them do not.

The majority of Americans did not support Martin Luther King's beliefs on race equality, but look where America is now.

Obviously, community service for an elementary school cannot compete with Dr. King's campaign, but they are alike.

Community service has the potential to change our school.

Please consider this suggestion and thank you so much for your time!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
