Should cellphone use be allowed while driving?

One of the biggest debates in this country is whether or not cellphones should be allowed to be used while driving. Years ago, my sister and I were driving to school as if it was any other school morning. As we approached the green stoplight and midway through the intersection, we were rammed by a truck, who ran a red light. The man in the truck was charged for running a red light and using his cellphone while doing so. This is only one of many accidents that has occurred because of the use of cellphones while driving. Texting and driving can lead to a car wreck, a death or injury of a pedestrian, and are major distractions.

Car accidents are almost frequent every single day. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2009 there were 11 million car accidents across the country. According to the National Safety Council, 25% of all car crashes are related to cellphone use, whether by talking on the phone or texting. Although many people think multitasking is always the answer, it is not the case when it comes down to driving. This is because phones are major distraction, probably the most distractive. Also, texting and driving can lead to the injury or death of a fellow pedestrian walking down the crosswalk. Any person on their phone can drive and accidently hit a pedestrian because the driver was too distracted to look down into their cellphones. Cellphones need to be away from the drivers' hands at all time.

Cellphone use can cause distractions and car accidents, along with the injury or death of a pedestrian. In many states, like Georgia, they have created a law where a driver cannot use his/her cellphone while driving. This law should be in effect nationwide to reduce the amount of deaths caused by accidents; due to the fact that the driver was using his/her cellphone. Texting and driving can lead to many bad things such as car accidents.
