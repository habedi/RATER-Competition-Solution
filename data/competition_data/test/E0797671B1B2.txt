Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that requiring all students to participate in community service is a great idea.

I think that this is a great opportunity to make the world a better place. People don't understand that a lot of people need help, even Earth. I think every student should do seven hours of community service a week and have the person they helped to sign the slip they get for community hours.

Everyone needs to start doing good like picking up litter, tutoring other people, helping people with their grocery shopping and even helping old people cross the street.

It is very important for this school to do community service because only few do it, a lot of people go home and just play video games, few go home and help pick up litter.

I think that requiring this school do community service would be a great idea and really help people out.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
