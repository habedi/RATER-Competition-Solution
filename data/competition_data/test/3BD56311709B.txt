"put your phone away,stop talking while i'm giving instructions".

The sound of the frustrated teacher once again telling her students to put away their cell phones and stop talking. Do you constantly get tired of hearing teachers say the same thing over and over again about the same topic? It has been said that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it will give the students to work at their own paste,students will actually listen and pay attention to what they are reading,learning, and writing,and students will not have a lot of stress and pressure on their backs.

First,students will be able to work at their own paste. "wow everyone your projects look great,great job". Generic_Name a tenth grade science teacher at Generic_School assigned her students a take home project about the plant and animal system,The project was given out April 1st and due May 2nd. Generic_Name constantly reminded her students about the project each class period,not trying to stress her students or rush them to get it done just a way of checking in with them making sure everyone was on the right track. Generic_Name would say things such as,"good morning class make sure you all are working on your projects diligently,remember they are due May 2nd and if you have any questions dont be ashamed to ask". Each week for the first four weeks Generic_Name would check her students progress to see how far along they come recording this data, week one,10 percent of students begun the project, week two twenty five percent,week three sixty seven,and finally,week 4 eighty percent of her students. Generic_Name was fairly impressed with her students hard work and just about almost the entire class has finished their project. Having students do their own work on their own time makes a huge impact on how much gets done,how well the work is prepared,and the overall grade of the work. Generic_Name at any moment stressed or demanded her students about the project,she constantly reminded them of the due dates and if any questions needed to be answered. Students doing work at their own paste at home made a difference all of Generic_Name students received an eighty five or higher on their take home project,which made all grades go up.

Next, students will actually pay attention to what they are reading, writing,and being taught. Have you ever had students who doze off while your reading, on their phone while your showing how to solve a math problem? Then assign them classwork they have know idea how to complete? It has been said that if students do things on their own such as,reading or solving a math problem they tend to have a better understanding and comprehend what they are reading or how to solve a math problem.

For example, Generic_Name just started middle school and everyday her English teacher Generic_Name reads two chapters of their new book,"the club" and asks the students to write a summary about what was read to them for a quiz grade. Every class period Generic_Name decides to fall asleep or play games on her phone while her teacher is reading,which causes her to miss the information and receive a failing grade for not completing the work. One day Generic_Name happens to miss school because he has the flu and leaves the class with a substitute. Generic_Names instructions say,"have the students read two more chapters of the book ,complete the worksheet and write two things they liked and disliked about the book for homework tonight".

The next day Generic_Name returns and notices that Generic_Name turned in her work from yesterday and the homework from last night for the first time all week. He realized that if he assigned work to his students to complete at home and have them read on their own not only does the work get completed by all students,but they all understand better and have a lot of good questions and ideas to discuss about it in class.

Finally, students will not have so much pressure.

" you will two homework assignments tonight,a quiz tomorrow on equations,and a test Friday on fractions". Generic_Name comes to class everyday and hears the same exact morning announcements in

Math class all the time knowing he hasnt done last nights homework or classwork,nor the night before that. Generic_Name and his family has just moved down form Texas to Virginia and has started a new high school and is under a lot of pressure,between school work,soccer,and the big move. Generic_Name has been in out of counsels offices trying to figure out what will be best for him to make up his missing assignments,pick up the slack in soccer practice,and make some new friends.

Generic_Name,his parents,and counselor deiced to sit down and find ways to help Generic_Name adjust to his new school and raise his grades so that he'l be ready for graduation in few months. They come up with a plan that Generic_Name will be able to take two classes of his choice online at home to help with his adjustments.

Weeks later Generic_Name and his counselor meet again for a follow up to see how his grades are,did he meet any friends,and how his online classes are going. It seems that Generic_Name was doing much better improving his grades to seventy fives and higher and becoming the new captain on his soccer team.

Students being pressured,not interested in the subject,or even not understanding whats going on can make huge impact on things they do everyday,such as going to school. Taking a few classes online at home anywhere not in a school environment can allow students to improve,make mistakes and not be ashamed,and ask questions and not be embarrassed about it. We never know what student go through and how they are physically and emotionally. It would benefit students to attend classes from home step into their shoes,take seven classes a day,attend a sport or after school activity,come home do homework or make up work live life as a student again.
