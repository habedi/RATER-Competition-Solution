The seagoing cowboys program is a fun program. You get to travel all over the world. You would get to see the excavating castle in Crete.

It is very fun traveling all over the world. You would be in a boat that crosses the atlantic ocean. you would go to Europe and China. The cattle boat would take you to Greece to see the Acropolis. But this whole trip is to help people. You will also go to Venice, Italy. You would also cross the panama canal,which was very fun. If you go on this trip you would start off a watchman. So every hour you would have to check up on the animals and report back to the captian. There would be a lot of hay to feed the horses. You can also play games on the ship when there is no horses. The favorite game I played was baseball. But there are lots of other games to play. their are nine trips in total.

This trip is a very fun and their is a lot of things you can do. The most impotant thing on this whole trip is helping the people. You got to take care of the animals. If you come onthis trip it will take some time to go to the other places. I really hope I convinced you to come on this fantastic trip.
