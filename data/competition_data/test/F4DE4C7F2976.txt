Dear Principal,

Many students rely on sports to push them through high school or pay for a full 4-year scholarship. For some, sports are the only reason they wake up and are excited about going to school. Athletes play after, before and during the school day, but that is no excuse to be having a C-average. Although students can rely on their sports now, but they will not always have the opportunities they do now by playing a sport. Students come to school to learn, not to play sports. Although sports are a great way to spend ones time, it sometimes can get in the way of their school work.

The athletes at our school should not be allowed to play until there grades are brought up to a B-average. This will motivate our athletes to excel in school and also in which ever sport the have chosen. The more they are pushed the more they will learn, therefore if you need C-average just to be on the team, they are only going to try for a C-average. Athletes are not being pushed to get better grades because coaches and parents hope for a great future in sports. Kids dream of becoming a NFL star Quarterback or the new Kobe Bryant but these dreams are very un realistic. One out of every thousand high school stars become professional. If these dreams do not come true and students have had a C-average their whole life, how do you expect them to graduate college with a high G.P.A. and go one to become a successful human being.

In conclusion, I strongly believe education should come before any sports. Students should achieve above and beyond so when the day comes that they are told they cant not play, they have a good back-up plan that will still lead them to success.
