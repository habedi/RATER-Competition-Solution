Dear Principal,

I have heard about your plan to change the school's policy on grade point average and how it affects a student's extracurricular activities. I personally believe that a 'B' average is to high and believe that the current 'C' average should stay in place.

I know many students who have a 'C' average because the did poorly on one or two tests over concepts they did not grasp or students who have hit a rough patch. I do not believe that the school should punish someone who simply did not grasp a concept or had a hard time with a lesson. Everyone faces that challenge, it just effects students differently.

In addition to that on our grading scale a 'C' is listed as "average".

The "average" student is indeed involved in extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs, "average" students hit that rough patch mentioned above, "average" students still give class there all and work hard to try to no longer be "average".

I also have a question to ask about your new policy.

What if a student who is currently on a team start to achieve an 'C' average, who is to be monitoring that. Is it the coach or sponsor, the teachers, you- the principal, is the student supposed to take that responsibility of coming forth and suspending or evening expelling him/her from the team or club they are involved in?

I bring this point forward because in each of these situations it is unfair or time consuming for the man or women in question. If the team coach or club sponsor checks grades then its is time consuming for them, most school coaches and sponsors being teachers themselves would not want to take another hour out of their day to check grades of each member/player. If the teachers of these students monitor their grades they also come at the time consuming element of it along with the fact that it is not the teachers responsibility to check up on the student and his/her outside-of-school life. If you are going to be screening grades ma'am you already are very busy and I could not find you having the time to screen all the club members and players at our school to see if they made the grade. The only option left is the student.

I know this places great responsibility on him or her to do there very best in class, but what about a boy on the basketball team who gives math class his all but cant seem to pass that one test, knows he is going to be kicked off the team, made fun of and questioned on why he was kicked off and now upset and hurt by the torment of strangers along with his friends.

This are just a few things to think about when making your decision on the school's policy on grade point average and how it affects a student's extracurricular activities. Though, as you see here, there a lot against it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
